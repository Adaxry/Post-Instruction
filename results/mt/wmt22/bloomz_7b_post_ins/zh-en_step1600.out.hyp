Students take the lead in Zhejiang University's academic year conference, and the research results open people's minds - Xinhua
Wash your hands with air, judge diseases by the breath, and search for the source of haze with precision Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Year Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of fantastic academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. The research covers many fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, humanities education, etc. The students started from a curious idea and created a number of high-end inventions with application value. Some of them have won awards at home and abroad.
Biological sensor: Your family doctor
The team of Biomedical Engineering College Ph.D. Zhang Di鸣 showed a bio-sensor with the size of only half of a smart phone on the spot.
You just need to breathe in gently, and the instrument can detect your overall health condition through the gas components in your breath.
Zhang Di Meng introduced that this sensor is connected to the smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the smartphone after calling out.
Smartwatches that can test a person's health generally test physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This bio-sensor utilizes graphene, a new material, as its active material. Its target is chemical elements. Its keen "olfactory" allows it to reflect health status more deeply and accurately.
Intelligent surgery light: doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart surgery lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won the silver medal at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
The Master's Student Zhu Lin靖 and Sun Junfei team from the School of Optics and Engineering opened a new idea in the defect of traditional surgery light and invented an intelligent LED surgery shadowless light.
Many diseases cannot be detected and removed in time, which is related to the light in the doctor's operating room.
Sun Junfei said, for example, when early cancer detection, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will also spread later.
This smart surgical light has four lamp holders, and through adjusting the spectrum, it can enhance the difference between different tissues under the light.
In the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and transparency of the light spot according to the needs of the operation and personal habits at any time.
This intelligent surgery light has been tested in the Shao Yifu Hospital of the Medical College of Zhejiang University and the Children's Hospital of the Medical College of Zhejiang University, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: save water and cool
The common people wash their hands by water flushing, and the most is to rub a little soap, squeeze a little hand sanitizer, while Li Qichang and his classmates have invented an "air hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the toilet of the device, our weight can compress the air.
It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and mixes with water.
So we can wash our hands now! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiment prove that the effect of hand washing through this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the洗净 degree, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among many world-class universities and received the only gold medal.

The certificate of emergency first aid
This is one of the important skills certificates besides my driving license!
普及一下：急救措施其实是应急救援，即在救护车来之前抢救。
It is well known that in the process of the ambulance coming after the accident, there is actually a period of time. And it is this period of time that is the most critical.
In this case, emergency treatment is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or sudden cardiac arrest, our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it is so important to know CPR!
When someone falls down around us, we can use the professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of standing there and doing nothing, which is too terrifying.
In China, there are 300,000 accidental deaths each year, and the most dangerous is sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the average is 15%.
In the casinos and hotels in Las Vegas, 70% to 80% can be saved. Shanghai and Beijing are below 1%."
This is what First Response co-founder Lu Le said.
If a person has a sudden cardiac arrest with no breath, no heartbeat, you cannot do CPR.
Only by performing CPR and external chest compression can a person be saved.
I find that now few people will have this consciousness to learn emergency treatment, but it is too late when things happen. So I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can make timely responses to emergencies.
It may also save someone's life!
You can sign up for the emergency permit at the Red Cross Training Center in your local area. I signed up at the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai. Students can also enjoy a discount.
PS: The last picture is to record the goals that should be completed before I turn 25. The emergency permit was added to the list a few months ago, but I have completed it!
After that, we have to go and take other certificates we want to take. We plan to take a diving certificate. We have seen a diving emergency certificate before in Little Red Book. It seems that we have to have an emergency certificate to take the diving emergency certificate. So the emergency certificate is still very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
There are only 13 yuan's worth of dumplings?
Not tried
Why don't you write it clearly?
Is it 13 yuan?
Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# failed to deliver the food, and this time it was just a shrimp dumpling for me?
Because I saw the code was valid before I input it
First of all, let me come to a conclusion. I personally believe that "Four Seas" is a full-range film that is bad from all aspects.
But if you say that the movie is not a highlight, it is not at least the music selection is good.
There are many kinds of movies that wallow you in sleep and there are many kinds of movies that make you feel indignant after watching. The audience feels like macaques on Mount Emei when they see "Four Seas". It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Kuan is truly exceptional.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it seems to be a creation of the K series, and it is difficult to name. There are too many holes like the windbreaker on Little Mac.
Even after watching it, you will doubt whether there is a hidden metaphor in the director. But after careful thinking, you will find it is actually a pile of shit.
First of all, let's talk about some parts that I find difficult to understand.
The main character lives on a small island in the south, and depends on his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranged that one elderly gentleman in the neighborhood drove a small面包车 to take her to the northeast to see snow.
The elderly sat in a面包车 from the south to the northeast to see snow???
He and his father are very confident about it.
Then the old man disappeared.
How did the owner's brother get the business license to operate a hotel on a discarded ship?
Why were the small gangs on the island able to close a mountain road with ease?
Then the truck carrying the rebar stopped at the side of the road, and there were no drivers around.
This kind of feeling is too obvious.
Why did a small gang with no credit and suspected of illegal activities become a police auxiliary?
Why not call the police in the face of high interest rates? The police even asked if there was a problem in the movie.
Knowing how to use a smart phone is one thing, but not knowing how to use a key card to open the door and then forcing oneself to sleep outside the room when the hotel boss is not found?
The absurdity of the plot filled the entire film, and I still felt pain when I recalled it.
In addition to the plot, it is even worse than the film's theme, that is, there is no theme at all, just a hideous stitch monster.
At the beginning of the film, you will think he wants to make a comedy film. After more than 20 minutes, you may guess it is an inspirational film. After half of the film, you may think it is a drama film about the hardships faced by young people in small towns. After watching the film, you will know nothing at all about what you have just seen. This is followed by a great deal of self-doubt: Why go to the cinema on New Year's Day to enjoy a bowel movement?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the patterns of various films. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, you can inspire and comedy and then tell the audience about a talented rookie how to achieve success one step at a time.
If you want to make a love film, then you should honestly talk about the love and hatred between the young town youth who likes to ride motorcycles and the girl server.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot contain something that is contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the role of the new motorcycle just burned, and then can sing) cannot go to open some of the brain holes that Kennedy could not bear.
As for the main character, who is not weak-minded, acting like a five-year-old child in some aspects, I really don't know if this is the reason for acting or the requirement of the director.
I also don't understand why Han Kuan, as a racing driver, is so interested in adding a collision scene in his own movie.
Is such a film arrangement in the Spring Festival box office just to annoy audiences?

Inspection well concrete module production processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment introduction:
Zhuhai Yixin is a professional manufacturer of concrete inspection well modules, brick machines, wall modules and brick machines in China. We can produce semi-automatic or fully automatic production lines.
Through years of practice and development, it now has quality that is good, mainly producing hydraulic, mobile and fully automatic inspection well series equipment and accessories.
Inspection well concrete module production processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Inspection well concrete module production processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment characteristics and advantages:
Yi Xin inspection well brick machine equipment is widely used for new砌筑 materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity and gas.
For example, inspection wells,雨水口,方沟,化粪池 and small construction facilities, such as bridges wing walls.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the four sides of the module are all grooves, and the combination of masonry forms a chain lock.
The shear strength of the wall is far superior to that of the flat friction mortar.
The module is a hollow structure, and when it is combined, the longitudinal holes are connected, while the transverse holes are connected. After the core is injected, it forms a reticulated concrete structure, which serves as a secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
There are grooves on both sides of the module, and the横向 and longitudinal grooves correspondingly improve the overall strength of the structure.
The use of concrete inspection well modules to construct inspection wells and drainage wells is not easy to collapse, sink, leak and other phenomena. Wall modules have stable mechanical performance, simple operation and standardized shaping dimensions.
The intelligent control of concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment is equipped with data input and output devices and a touch screen LCD monitor to monitor the entire process of mechanical operation, achieving ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of materials, density operation, safety logical control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the wall module of the well uses single-cylinder hydraulic and conveyance, and dual-cylinder hydraulic and conveyance.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the impact of vibration on the hydraulic system caused by the vibration of the main machine, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment distribution box walking model box uplift, storage box door closed, automatic conveyor plate, all of which are completed by the hydraulic system independently, thus reducing the wear and tear of machinery.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computer, electrical components, sealing hydraulic components, and guarantees the comprehensive performance of the equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical vibration platform of the wall module of the well adopts the whole plate steel, and the cutting edge of the platform is weldless, so that the packing box can freely swing and guide, and fully reduce the mechanical wear.
The load of the mold is reduced, the packing is combined and the amplitude is unified and synchronized, and the vibration of the machine and the mold is synchronized, so as to ensure the effect of vibration.
The wall module of the well is mechanically excited by the machine, and the amplitude is automatically controlled by the computer. The amplitude is adjusted according to the cost benefit of the raw materials, and there is no wearing resistance braking, thus prolonging the service life and reducing the cost.
The wall module has dual functions of automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing middle school piloted modern apprenticeship system - Xinhua
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year onwards, the city will pilot the “modern apprenticeship” talent training model in 60 middle vocational schools. The students accepted by the pilot training will not only hold the apprentice identity, but also be registered as the unit employees by the pilot enterprises after admission.
The municipal education commission requires that the standardization of the admission and employment of middle vocational schools, and the clarification of the dual identity of apprentice middle vocational school students and enterprise qualified employees, according to the two-way selection principle, the apprentice, the school and the enterprise sign a three-party agreement, and for apprentices who are 16 years old and under 18 years old, the apprentice, the guardian, the school and the enterprise sign a four-party agreement, to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content, rights protection and other aspects of apprentice training in place.
Encouraged the pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship form and cooperate with enterprises to jointly carry out pre-employment training and transfer training of enterprise staff.
The pilot schools should reform the talent training mode.
The school and enterprises jointly designed the talent training program, jointly formulated professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot is carried out in the form of a pilot cycle. The period of student internship in enterprise is determined according to the professional training program. The internship at the job generally lasts for 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise group management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different specialties, a teacher can lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students master the skills required for each training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city will determine 60 pilot projects for the modern apprenticeship system of middle vocational schools in three batches, each with about 50 people. A total of 3000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
According to the principle of pilot first and gradual promotion from point to point, explore and establish a long-term mechanism for joint admission, joint training and integrated education for school-enterprise cooperation, and effectively improve students' job skills and employment quality.

South African doctors: Omicron has a strong communicability, but most cases are mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the mystery strain of the coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta strain, although the latter is more contagious.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spread in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the Western Cape province of South Africa reported that they were treating patients with mild symptoms of Covid-19, such as body pain and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.
The director of the organization, Dr. Anben Pillay, said that he saw dozens of patients every day, but none of them were hospitalized.
Pelle said, "They can control the disease at home. Most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that it included elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to become seriously ill due to the coronavirus infection.
Compared with that, in the previous wave of Delta epidemic, he treated new coronavirus patients with "sore throat and low blood oxygen level."
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days."
In the two weeks after the first report of the mutation of the Omicron virus in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, in recent weeks, only 30% of new coronavirus patients admitted to hospital were in serious condition, half of the previous wave of severe cases; the average hospital stay was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3% of recent coronavirus patients died, while 20% of early cases in South Africa died.
According to data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, William Hanekom, the director of the African Health Research Institute, said: "At present, almost all the signs indicate that it is a mild disease."
He also said: "It is still early. We need to get the late data.
Normally, the time of hospitalization and death is later, and we only entered this wave of epidemic for two weeks. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, and testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the major new coronavirus strain in the world, Omíkhoron cases have appeared in dozens of countries, including South Africa, which is the epicenter of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in豪登省 in the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests showed that the case of Omicran variant accounted for more than 90%.

Education commentary: What is the key to rescuing abducted children?
If compared with the famous public welfare advertisement saying "Without buying and selling, there would be no killing," in a good environment without the need for "escorting", the collective prevention and defense and the whole people against forgery make the forgery behavior unprofitable, risky and costly, so such crimes would not repeatedly occur.
Recently, the Child Abduction Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an Internet information platform established to establish an authority channel for information on missing children and find missing children in a timely manner.
I heard that the app is called "Union", and I felt very warm.
The new technology means not only the name of "Literature" and the feelings, but also the information application appropriately and effectively.
The primary goal of law enforcement against child trafficking is to find the abducted children and protect their safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment can be listed in many "large words" from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
However, before the case of human trafficking is broken, it is necessary to pay more attention to the safety of the victims.
It is necessary to prioritize the goals. Under the urgency of the goal of "finding a rescue", controversial topics such as "whether or not it is necessary to impose the death penalty on the trafficking of children" can be put on hold for a careful discussion, but the rescue of abused children cannot wait.
According to the experience of the investigation of such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to leaving the crime scene as soon as they get their hands on it.
Every minute's delay in finding the missing child will take him one step away from his parents, making the case more difficult to solve.
In this situation, it is pragmatic to take effective measures such as the "Union" platform, which directly helps detect cases and find children.
In the end, it is a great task to operate the entire legal system to do a good job in “fighting against拐卖”.
In order to combat crime and safeguard the rights and interests of children and parents, it is necessary to implement the care of "protecting weak children" from the improvement of legislation to the guarantee of justice and the careful implementation of law enforcement.
In addition, the prevention of trafficking in children can be done better from family to society.
For example, a common case, a family of three was resting at the railway station when their parents fell asleep. When they woke up, they found that their child had disappeared.
It is not expected that a two-year-old child has enough self-protection skills, but as the parent of a young child, at least have the awareness of protection.
It is the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police's anti-trafficking crime, the side of buying the trafficked children should also be concerned and punished.
The single illegal act is often only one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the "Code of Criminal Procedure" of the People's Republic of China, the minimum penalty for the crime of kidnapping children is 5 years; in cases of particularly serious circumstances, the minimum penalty may reach the death penalty and the confiscation of property.
With the high starting point and the heaviest punishment, the crime of拐卖儿童 is obviously a serious crime under the trend of "lightening punishment".
However, many cases of human trafficking still occur every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward ideas about raising children and weak legal awareness.
The legal education for this part of people should be followed up simultaneously.
In order to effectively control the crime of trafficking in persons, it is not enough for the authorities to strictly enforce the law.
If the "marketplace" exists, the traffickers are greedy, and they constantly innovate trafficking means to fight against law enforcement, which will result in a low efficiency mess.
Therefore, breaking through the backward concept, popularizing legal knowledge, and also helping to eradicate the crime of kidnapping and buying children.
Yang浩东 delivered a talk on the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress and the provincial party congress at Ma栏山
Inspired by the 100-year history of the Party
Hunan Daily News, December 10 (reported by是全媒体记者 龚柏威) According to the unified arrangement of the provincial committee, on the morning of December 10, Yang Hodong, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of Propaganda of the Provincial Committee, made an interactive lecture in the Video Creative Park of Ma栏, and thoroughly studied and implemented the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, studied and implemented the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech and instructions and批示 on Hunan, studied and implemented the spirit of the 12th Party Congress of the province.
Yang Hodong discussed the essence and requirements of the spirit of the CPC Central Committee from the perspectives of ideal and belief, the mission of the early days, self-improvement and the youth party, and Party leaders and Party theory. Based on his personal experience and introspection, he made an introduction to the essence and requirements of the spirit of the Central Committee from three aspects.
He pointed out that we should integrate the spirit of the full meeting and the important instructions and批示 of General Secretary Xi Jinping into the study, and integrate the spirit of the provincial party congress into the study, so as to enhance the consciousness of defending “two确立” and achieving “two maintenances”, and unswervingly move forward under the guidance of General Secretary Xi Jinping.
In the interactive exchange session, the grass-roots cadres representatives, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of the “two确立”, and how to grasp the orientation of the cultural enterprises, as well as how to draw strength from the 100-year history of the Party for the new generation.

The International Olive Oil Council classifies olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil and lampante olive oil or refined olive oil.
The first-press olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is obtained from fresh olive fruit by mechanical cold pressing and other treatments to remove impurities.
According to the different acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: The highest grade and quality of olive oil, it is a natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
Fine Virgin olive oil: slightly acidic, not more than 2%, pure and fragrant in taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity is not more than 3.3%.
The refined olive oil is the olive oil after refining the oil with acidity higher than 3.3%, or it becomes the "second oil".
The refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Olive oil: refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to adjust the taste and color. Its acidity is less than 1.5% and transparent golden yellow.
Refined olive pomace oil or olive pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): It is refined olive oil extracted and refined from oil cake.
You should have noticed by now that the acidity of olive oil is a very important index.
Olives, just like wine grapes, come from different regions and different olive varieties, and will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best growing area for olive:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil, temperature, sunlight, air humidity, and rainfall for the growth of olive trees.
In addition to the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be planted sparsely in the suitable areas.
Main production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, as well as countries with similar climates such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa, are all far south of the equator.
The harvesting month of olive oil:
The olive tree blooms and bears fruit from March to June every year, and the fruit develops and matures from July to October. The fruit changes color from green to red, purple, and finally black.
The harvest season for fruits is from November to February next year (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
The nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in rich monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
After the conclusion of the Democratic Summit, Biden said that the flame of freedom will never be extinguished
The online "Democracy Summit" convened by US President Joe Biden and attended by leaders of government and civil society and private sectors from 110 countries around the world ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing speech, Biden said that the flame of freedom was burning in the hearts of all people in the world, and the authoritarian regime could never extinguish it.
He also said that the plan is to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwanese government representatives and civil servants, Tang Feng and currently exiled British Hong Kong democracy and human rights activists, Luo Gan聪, also made speeches at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work is ahead of us.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge because I have said before, as this summit shows, the democratic world is everywhere.
The authoritarian regime can never extinguish the flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said: "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the protective wall of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, and be able to withstand the buffer and impact of authoritarianism and those who want to pursue power before the public interest. "
On the second day of the "Democratic Summit," the themes were respectively defending human rights, consolidating democracy and combating authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with the "International Human Rights Day."
In his opening speech on the same day, United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially the challenges brought about by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "It is now time to reiterate our common values and positions and the resilience of democracy.
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving inequality problems, combating corruption, updating social contracts, investing in high-quality education, and expanding the opportunities of women and girls.
This also requires resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including all tools used by the technological revolution. "
Luo Gan聪, a democratic rights activist in Hong Kong, addressed the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding the participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong, as well as in Uyghurs and Tibetans, who are ethnic minorities in China.
He said: "Over the years, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Luo Guanzhong also called on the free world to unite to fight the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: “Maybe some of you are afraid of angering General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don’t want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you haven’t realized the threat of the Communist Party of China to our democratic values.
And that's the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason we must change. "
At the round-table discussion on “fighting against digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values”, Taiwan Executive Yuan Policy Committee Member Dr. Tang Feng, via video, issued the “State Declaration”, stressing that Taiwan is at the forefront of fighting against authoritarianism and totalitarianism.
He also shared how to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "In the midst of the flourishing democracy in Taiwan, we have always stood at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, the authoritarian governments in all parts of the world justified the violation of human rights on the pretext of public health and collective interests. Global democracy showed signs of backwardness.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to close the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to withdraw to defeat the fake information. "
At the same time as the second day of the "Democratic Summit", the US Treasury announced the imposition of sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea and other countries, as well as investment restrictions on a company in China that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the口水鸡 delivered by the restaurant is alive
I want to try tennis, but I am afraid that I will not be able to continue. So I want to find a similar price to practice.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, then the normal price of the expensive is more friendly than the cheap one. Such "入门拍" are actually industrial garbage.
They have low strength. When the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large. The hard ball cannot withstand. It is difficult for high level players to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult that you know you won't learn, and you know you won't be able to afford the expensive stuff, so you get a cheap one to pass the time, and when you play it twice, you'll never play again, so the racket is cheap and you won't miss it.
When you can really distinguish good from bad, that means you have made progress, and come back to me to buy expensive ones, I will make twice as much money.
It is recommended to buy a second-hand good ball bat for a similar price. Choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so good ball bats also cannot be sold for a high price. A new bat with a price of RMB 500 to RMB 600 is good. A second-hand bat for 200 is not worth it?
It's friendly to beginners, but once you get past the beginner stage, it's just a piece of junk. But most people, especially girls, can't get past the beginner stage.
The delivery time has been delayed many times
Could you please help me follow up?

Thank you.
That is to say, I actually have credit?
Next, do I need to place a new order? Or was the previous order without effect?

In fact, there are many tips for dressing well for girls with a slight physique.
Girls with thicker bodies should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length should be about knee-high, and the skirt should just cover the thicker part of their thighs.
If the skirt is too short, the fat on the legs will be exposed.
If it's too long, it will give the impression of being short and fat.
If you can divide it into three sections, it will show that you naturally increase height. The upper part, skirt and tights should have different colors to produce a slender effect.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard equipment of fat girls (the author has a deep understanding of this). Dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat. Elegant black dresses are also the first choice of fat girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially black, can make you appear slimmer.
If your legs are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too much attention.
The more popular it is, the less colorful the color should be.
In order to avoid the feeling of obesity when people pay attention to your legs and feet.
For girls who are slightly overweight, we should tell them the tips for dressing up.
The girl who is slightly overweight should never wear the tight skirt. In addition, the top should not be too short or塞进裙子里, which is very unpleasant to look at. If your legs are thick, you should wear the black long dresses or the knitted socks (the fine-meshed ones, of course). Choose the soft-printed喇叭裙 and a loose shirt for a good look.
Of course, there are also rules for girls who are slightly overweight when wearing skirts.
If a fat girl wears a skirt, she should choose a shirt with the same color as the skirt. This will make her fat body appear taller.
Short skirts paired with heels can make your legs appear longer, which is the most fashionable combination in the summer!
If you are thicker in the upper body but thinner in the legs, you may choose a skirt with a glamorous touch.
It can not only hide the big belly, but also show your advantages.
The A-line skirt will make you look slender, and is more suitable for girls who are overweight. The top should be selected to be tighter, so that there will be more layers.
Simple white T-shirt and short skirt, suitable for obese women.
The girl with slight obesity can also wear fashion.
As long as you can master the rules of clothing combination, then the girls with slight curves will also become the focus of attention.
After making changes in dressing up, we should also make more exercise in our daily life so as to脱离 the label of underweight girls as early as possible😄

Girls take aim at their sisters as a target for fund-raising. - Xinhua
In the square in Wulin, Hangzhou, a girl stood in front of a big wooden board, on which were written the words, "Human target, 10 yuan per arrow."
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl willing to be a 'arrow target' to raise funds for her sister" went viral on WeChat.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board, which is a little higher than a person, and has the words "Man's meat target, 10 yuan per arrow" written on it, indicating that after paying, passersby can use arrows to shoot.
The behavior triggered heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity director of the police sub-district division of Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such an extreme action after she raised funds for her sister. However, such behavior is not worthy of promotion. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl accused of collecting donations on the street as a "arrow靶"
In the photo, a girl with long hair is standing in front of a large wooden board, on which black ink has written the words "human target, 10 yuan per arrow", and her other wooden board is written with her bank account and WeChat, Alipay account.
The photo caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believed that this was a “begging behavior for attention”, and many netizens showed sympathy for this.
We found the situation when we patrolled by the square around 10:00 am on the 23rd. At that time, many onlookers had gathered.
When interviewed by the local media, the police officers of the Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls on the street selling goods, both of which were around 20 years old and well-groomed.
Among them, the girl who acted as a "body target" was crying and asking passersby to play the game; the other girl helped shout and said that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery fee, please help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting donations to treat her sister's leukemia. "
Last night, the publicity director of the police sub-district division of Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Jijia Li, and she raised funds for her sister Jijia Yang.
However, due to the need for more than 300,000 yuan of treatment costs at one time, it was not easy to find a good way to raise funds, so it made such a behavior.
He said that during the whole process, the two girls were targets and the other one was responsible for helping, but they did not participate in it. No one shot arrows during the whole process, but people watched and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After the police verified by the public security department, the bows and arrows used by the police were not in the scope of control.
The person in charge said, "It is not recommended to adopt this kind of eye-catching fund-raising method."
After being warned by the police, she has left the police station.

What is the most popular in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
You think only Olympic athletes can win?
Recently, an article called "Quick Look! Olympic Games where Project Managers can冲击金牌" became very popular, where it was mentioned that project managers can always take the lead in many projects, no one can match them: Moving bricks, traveling, working overtime, fighting fires, and apologizing are all part of their daily routine.
It seems like a joke, but it also tells the story of the daily hardships of project managers, and reflects the inability of current project management.
And those who work in project management have gradually chosen some actions to get rid of the difficulties in their work.
Judging from the number of people enrolling in the PMP (the international certification for project management professionals), more and more project management practitioners are enhancing their project management skills through learning.
According to the "Report on the Development of China’s Project Management in the past 20 Years (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of people applying for the PMP® certification was nearly 600,000, and the number of people certified by the PMP® was about 420,000, with about 300,000 people holding valid certificates, which accounted for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificates issued worldwide.
The number of PMP holders has increased every year in the past decade, which indicates that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer possible to rely on simply following the "old experience" to do things. The ever-changing working environment tells us that we must learn to explore the path forward by standing on the shoulders of giants.
However, does passing the PMP guarantee smooth project management?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the relevant knowledge points of the 10 areas and 5 process groups of project management, but when they actually carry out project management work, they are still in a state of ignorance.
Many project managers often feedback the following questions: Project management awareness is not enough, relying only on personal experience, having project management theory, but unable to practice; lack of systematic project management process and system support, unable to be implemented in work, project estimation is not accurate, controllability is poor, project is delayed again and again; member division of labor is not clear, and the "old oil" in the team does not know how to deal with it; cross-department communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, with more than 10 years of experience in the fields of product innovation and research and development management, we have helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other key research and development personnel, and won the honorary title of "China Enterprise Research and Development Management Talent Training Demonstration Base".
The online course of "Research and Development Project Manager Special Training营" This is a kind of online fragmented learning combining the practical cases, tools and methods of many research and development companies to help you master the knowledge and standard actions of project managers and take a step towards the advancement of your own project management.
This is also a chance for enterprises to use lower costs and less investment to promote the cultivation process of project managers and bring efficient operation results to enterprises.
We can only have faith in what they said based on their words, but we can see from the reviews of other students how they feel about the course: The course is not only the professional interpretation of the course contents by the experts of Zhongtianshuhua team (the former Huawei R&D management team) combined with the international advanced project management method论 and many famous enterprises real business scenarios.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich templates and forms, helping students to apply the learning content to specific work after class.

JX “Double 12”前夕向消费者倡导理性消费 - 经济观察网 - 专业财经新闻网站
This year’s “Singles’ Day” national online payment business transaction amount reached RMB1.77 trillion, a new high compared with previous years.
With a variety of discounts and red packets, and eye-catching live shopping, consumers have once again said that they have benefited, and this consumer boom has not only made people wonder about the increasingly strong consumer power of the nation, but also forced people to come to terms with the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer groups in contemporary society.
On the eve of “Double 12”, JX Finance Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “JX Finance”) issued a rational consumption appeal, reminding all users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption consciousness and consumption habits, and to refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
On the whole, the performance of China's residents in financial consumption is better, but there are significant differences in financial behavior and skills. It is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy of the elderly and young people is relatively low. The "old and young" will still be the focus of the continuous attention of financial education; the "China Young People’s Liabilities Report" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance show that the young generation has great potential for consumption, credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, and 86.6% of young people are using credit products. Nearly half of the young people have no debt accumulation. The young generation shows a rational consumption trend on the whole, although it is far different from the "over-spending" label attached by the outside world. However, some young people do exist in excessive consumption, following consumption behavior, and thus generate too great a financial pressure and debt risk, even leading to social problems gradually increasing. Financial enterprises should be willing to shoulder social responsibilities and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, JX has been committed to helping the common people build their own happy life with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a proper consumption outlook, and actively responding to the call of the regulator to enhance consumers' rational consumption awareness with practical actions.
In the past few years, JX has carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and has helped them establish rational consumption concepts, reasonably plan their consumption needs, and accumulate life wealth by cooperating with top domestic universities.
On the eve of the Double 12, JX Finance reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumption loan misunderstandings, and avoid affecting personal credit and future economic life.
It is necessary to plan ahead and repay the loan in time when making a purchase.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the future purchase of cars and real estate.
At the same time, while enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check the qualifications of relevant institutions.
In the future, JX will rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated financial products to provide consumers with more贴合需求 and diversified services. It will continue to help the general public improve their financial knowledge level and help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, becoming a reliable consumer finance partner for consumers for life.

Vietnam People’s Daily Online - The Gulf Cooperation Council should address common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit of Mohammed bin Salman to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in 2017, causing a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
The diplomatic tension seriously affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed a deal with the United States and Kuwait to move towards "stability and unity."
Saudi Arabia reopened the border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading the efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors by the two countries in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states resolved their differences and restored their relations with Qatar for the sake of the interests of all countries and regional stability, aiming at addressing common challenges.
During the visit of Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighboring countries.
The channel, with a length of 725 kilometers, will facilitate the travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of the two countries.
The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries have signed 13 cooperation memorandums of understanding worth $300 billion.
The visit of Saudi Crown Prince to the Gulf countries coincided with negotiations by Iran and the world’s major powers to save the Iran nuclear agreement, a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which the Gulf countries condemned as they considered it impossible to solve the issue of Iranian missiles.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a "competitor" and regarded Iran's nuclear plan as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf countries believe that the failure to solve the Iranian missile issue and not to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region is defective.
Under the background of failed negotiations between major countries and Iran on nuclear issues, Saudi Arabia and Iran have conducted direct negotiations.
Its goal is to prevent the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that can slow down the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming Arab League Summit will be the first summit for Arab League member countries since some member countries clashed with Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements it has made to contribute to the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and put forward measures to make its member countries fully cooperate to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is claimed that the exhaust sound of the super car in the new area is the largest!
This car, brought to you by our team, is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor of Murcielago, Aventador LP700-4!
It costs nearly two million Malaysian ringgit, and the road tax is around 10,000 Malaysian ringgit per year. Why is it called the LP700?
With 700 horsepower, how fast can you imagine?
Well, I don't know. According to the data, it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h, which is about the time it takes my car to reach 30 km/h when the speedometer is already at 100 km/h, yes.
The low, spindle-shaped body, the brazen scissor doors, the huge air intakes all over the body, as well as the clear view of the 6.5 v12 engine under the glass, perfectly embodied the style of Lamborghini.
For the description of the car model, it is not necessary to say much. You can do a Google search yourself. Here are some explanations that the Google may not provide!
It was too much attention, wherever we went, everyone was watching, it was very uncomfortable!
The cost of petrol at 1km is around RM1 (the owner is not caring at all)
Practice your上下车姿势, or you'll be a little embarrassed (because you'll climb out of the cab and then get stuck in the middle)
The engine sound was too loud, and I suddenly became deaf after getting off the bus. (But it was still very enjoyable)
The vehicle is too large, and it will be narrow to stop in a normal parking space. I am afraid to be hit by the door of the adjacent car!
I'm a little lonely because there are no rivals on the road (this is what the author himself said, not related to the car owner, hahaha)
Please don't misunderstand, this video's supercar is not for sale, sorry!
If you want to take a video of your car, please contact us!
More unknown car information, just in The Car Guide / People's Auto Journal
The accident involved a car worth millions!
The Bugatti Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, while the Porsche 911 is priced at a million dollars!
Just a few days ago, millions of supercars such as 911 and Chiron were knocked down in a few minutes in the world!
Check the results, and you are right!
Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits that a university has accumulated over time in its development, and is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit is of great significance to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, as well as the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, they emerged at the time of national danger, and their spirit was greatly influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. They advocated the value concept of "promoting the enlightenment of the world and rectifying the governance" and the nationalism of "strengthening the country through education".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is increasingly obvious. The global education competition, scientific and technological competition and talent competition continue to intensify. As an important "offer" side, the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the introduction of the "General Plan for the Construction of World Class Universities and World Class Departments" has not only shown China's confidence and determination to move from a large country in higher education to a strong country in higher education, but also put forward higher and more demanding requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to enter the world's top 200 in a short time, accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having a certain gap, and achieve "oversteering"?
In addition to the firm goal, confidence in the path and ability, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the advantage of later development, through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant increase in academic level and teaching quality; second, cultural advantage, inherit the wisdom内涵 of the five thousand years of Chinese civilization, promote the development of excellent traditional culture, and use this to unite strength, shape brands, and improve the image; third, institutional advantage, give full play to the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthen the goal drive, bring the consensus force, optimize the resource allocation, and provide a sustainable solid guarantee for the school to accelerate its catch-up with the world's advanced level.
It is particularly important to realize that it is impossible to build world-class universities in a uniform manner. All schools must show their personality and characteristics while playing their advantages.
The characteristics of the school should have both common Chinese characteristics and unique goals, traditions and resources.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we attach importance to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in our education: First, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative entrepreneurs and the construction of an integrated education environment that combines science and education and combines schools and enterprises, forming a complete ecosystem of entrepreneurship education; Second, we highlight the characteristics of cross-disciplinary meetings and promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, create a system of cross-disciplinary meetings and actively cultivate emerging cross-disciplinary disciplines and landmark cross-disciplinary achievements; Third, we highlight the characteristics of our education system and social service and carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation to accelerate the formation of a cooperation system of Zhejiang University.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of “innovate to seek the truth”, the shared value of “studying hard, cultivating virtue, distinguishing truth from false, and acting with sincerity”, and the shared value of “embracing rivers and lakes, opening up to the masses, and developing our country” have jointly formed the latest expression system of Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of education and accumulate cultural height and凝聚 spiritual strength. It has rich connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "H纳江河" emphasizes openness and inclusiveness, reflects the spirit of "using the talents all over the world", and demonstrates how to absorb the excellent ideas of running schools and educating people from world-renowned universities; "启真厚德" emphasizes the pursuit of the truth and the pursuit of the best spirit, which means that when the university pursues truth, it should also accept the training of virtue and the refinement of character; "开物前民" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, including the pursuit of new knowledge, scientific research innovation, and reform and development; "树我邦国" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that the university should always share in the national honor and disgrace.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
"Smart people listen to the silent, and bright people see the invisible."
Chinese colleges and universities should further立足于中国特色社会主义事业的全局，深刻把握高等教育事业所处的时代方位和承担的历史使命，加快建设成为世界一流大学。
At the same time, we should uphold humanistic care and independent freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the national spirit intertwine, and thus provide endless impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national revitalization and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

The length of time for college students in Guangxi to take a leave of absence and start a business can reach 5 years - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 19 (Reporter Zhang Ying) A reporter learned from the Education Department of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region recently that colleges and universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible curriculum in the future. The length of time for college students to take a leave of absence will be relaxed. The period of time for students to take a leave of absence and start their own businesses will be extended by 2 to 5 years based on the original curriculum. The time for taking a leave of absence can be considered as practical education time.
In order to promote the entrepreneurial innovation ability of college students, the education, human resources and social security departments of Guizhou Province have worked together to build a start-up platform and build more university campus practice teaching bases, university science parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, start-up incubators and other external guarantees for university student entrepreneurship.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the areas of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases of colleges and universities should reach more than 3,000 square meters for undergraduate schools and more than 1,000 square meters for high vocational schools.
The government encourages colleges and universities to set up innovation and entrepreneurship credits, and to prioritize students who excel in innovation and entrepreneurship in their majors.
Teachers at colleges and universities are required to serve in industry and enterprises for at least two months every two years to enhance their awareness and ability in innovative entrepreneurship education.
The Education Department of the Autonomous Region requires all universities in Guangxi to thoroughly implement the training program for innovation and entrepreneurship of college students, and strives to make every college student participate in an innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their school years.

Just when NFT was getting hot, the crypto community had another new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in the Asian region. Residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic began to get steady income in this game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based pet养成 game that combines NFT and other玩法. It is currently the highest transaction NFT project with more than US$3 billion.
According to TokenTerminal data, the daily income of Axie Infinity exceeded $820,000, close to the earnings of "王者荣耀".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The success of "Axie Infinity" has passed a new "palytoearn" mode to more people. Through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer single roles. In addition to enjoying the game and obtaining economic benefits, players can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game production company, but is guaranteed by the blockchain technology.
When I saw a news about the stock price of my friend, my biggest impression was that when choosing the industry in which the enterprise would invest, that is, the industry in which the investment target was, firstly, it should choose the industry with big growth space, at least 100 billion market size; secondly, it should choose the industry with good future growth, considering the industry with the best future growth in the next 3 to 5 years; finally, it should choose the industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and the flatness or ruggedness of the track refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
To the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
The tactic is to "do the things right," which means to do them correctly.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find the direction, the tactics are to implement it, and there is strategic thinking above the majority of tactics.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking) above, we can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or expand horizontally in the field (strategic thinking); for example, how to increase customer retention rate (tactical thinking) above, we can think about how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); above, we can think about how to set the correct KPI for activities to achieve the correct activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and attracting new customers; above, we can think about whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
After 12 years, Bitcoin celebrated several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small Central American country, designated Bitcoin as the country's legal currency, making Bitcoin the first legal currency of a country or region.

From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin conducted a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Thank you photographers and makeup artists for allowing me to have a unique wedding photo.
Thank you all the staff who took the wedding photo today. We are looking forward to seeing the finished photo.
It is a physical job to take wedding photos, especially the photographer, who has to run and jump.
The make-up artist designed a make-up style suitable for my face shape, and the photographer was very funny and deserved praise.
Thank you my photographers and make-up artists, I can still see how beautiful I can be in my lifetime.

It is more important for the photographer and the make-up artist to be aesthetically pleasing. Fortunately, I have met them.
After seeing my wedding photo, I found out that I was also a "photo deceiver".
U.S. Asian American Groups Claim Discrimination in Admissions at Harvard, Yale and Princeton - Xinhua
Washington D.C., May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 Asian American groups submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting against three Ivy League colleges -- Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College -- for discriminating against Asian American applicants during the admissions process.
The Asian Education Alliance, which initiated the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The chairman of the group, Zhao Yuanyuan, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American famous colleges and universities has been doubled, but in these three American famous colleges and universities, the proportion of Asian students has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities discriminate against Asian students in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" admissions process "long-term and systematically."
According to Zhao Yu空, in 2014, the study of Sanders and other scholars showed that among the three universities, the admission rate of Asians was the lowest relative to the number of applicants.
The data from the U.S. Department of Education also showed that among all Ivy League universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest proportion of Asian students, while Yale University and Brown University had implemented racial quotas for Asian students for more than 20 years in practice.
After submitting the appeal, the United States Department of Education and Department of Justice are expected to investigate and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from discriminating against Asian students in the admissions, said Zhao Yun空 to the reporter from Xinhua News Agency.
They also expect colleges and universities to be proactive in addressing the issue and change their admissions policies towards Asians.
At present, the three colleges and universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it complained about Harvard University's admissions discrimination, but the US Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese American groups that participated in the appeal, it also included American Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a real estate brokerage firm that there was a factory located in Zhaotong, Yuyao City, Zhejiang Province. After visiting the site several times, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu consulted with Mr. Lin, the family member of the property owner, about the details of the purchase of the factory and sent a deposit of RMB 200,000 via bank transfer the same day.
Lin signed as the payer on the "Deposit Receipt for the Sale of Factory Premises," which stated that "if the buyer did not want to buy the factory premises, the deposit would be returned to the seller; if the seller did not want to sell the factory premises, the deposit would be returned to the buyer twice, and the parties agreed to sign a contract for the sale of the factory premises within a week."
However, due to the failure of the parties to reach a consensus on major contract clauses such as the scope of the sale of the factory and the payment method, the housing purchase contract has not been signed for a long time.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the 20,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
After paying the deposit and preparing the money, the buyer was waiting for the seller to sign the contract. However, the seller refused to sell the house. This made Mr. Lu frustrated and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yizhou Municipal People's Court.
After the trial, the court held that the failure of the parties to sign a formal contract cannot be solely attributed to the defendant. It is reasonable to assume that the parties did not reach an agreement, and therefore, the penalty of double the amount of the deposit should not be imposed on the defendant. The defendant is not required to pay the penalty of double the amount of the deposit.
After the first judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the second court of appeal upheld the original verdict.
Lawyers remind: You should exercise due diligence in the course of the transaction.
In signing the contract, as the buyer, you should perform the necessary duty of careful attention, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, etc., and making it clear in the contract about the specific time and place of delivery to prevent disputes between the two sides when the contract is performed.
(German Voice中文网 ) After the "民主峰会" ended on Friday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a speech on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leadership Summit for Democracy", which was "line-drawing with ideology, making democracy a tool and weapon, pretending to be democracy to carry out real anti-democracy and煽动分裂对抗, and shifting domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "over the long term, the United States has imposed its political system and value system on others, carried out 'democratic reconstruction', abused unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', causing disastrous consequences.
‘Democracy’ has long been a ‘massive killer’ used by the US to interfere in other countries.
This summit is a move by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held via video, and leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited to participate, including Taiwan leaders. However, China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democracy, saying that the United States did not have the right to host such a summit.
And there were also voices questioning in the international community and the United States itself. For example, some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of Philippines, Poland and Brazil, were invited to attend the summit, and some people suspected that the real intention of the Biden administration was not to promote democracy, but to achieve geopolitical goals through the summit.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also participated in the video democracy summit
The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on Saturday said, "Today's American democracy is pathological, and the problems of money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social division, racial conflict, and class division are intensifying. The American democracy is based on capitalism."
In his speech, U.S. President Joe Biden said that "as the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the protective barrier of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resistant to the缓冲 and impact of authoritarianism and those who want to pursue power before the public interest. "
He emphasized that democracy is not an automatic process. "We must continuously update it in each generation. In my opinion, this is a decisive challenge of our age. "
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "face continuous and worrying challenges. Democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The United States has promised to launch a one-year action after the summit, including a $44.4 billion initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent journalism.
The United States hopes that all countries will make concrete public commitments before the 2022實體民主峰會,以改善其民主制度。
Biden said, "Let us all implement our commitments and report our progress next year."
Okay, I only fear that he will send the wrong address

How to drink whisky with a red card?
Everyone has different tastes, and some people like to collect, some people like to eat, and of course some people like to drink. Red Label whisky is one of the most popular Scottish whiskys in various countries, and Red Label whisky has won the Gold Medal at the International Wine and Spirit Competition.
Each bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, you are spoiling its richness.
How to drink the red card whisky?
Here is a simple introduction for you.
How to drink whisky with a red card:
Johnnie Walker Red Label is made up of 35 different whiskies from Scotland. It has a rich and traditional Scottish whisky aroma, with a sweet, smoky aroma in the middle.
The entry is rich and fresh, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
The wine can be drunk directly with ice or mixed with favorite drinks.
Red Card Whisky was introduced into China. In order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, Red Card Whisky + Cola or Soda or New Coke or other bubble drinks have become a fashion that has lasted for a long time.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the acid taste, can also bring visual pleasure. They are added to drinks to change the taste.
Red Card Whisky + Sliced Lemon + Square Sugar (Sugar can also be used), is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The authentic red fang wine has a slightly sour taste. Sugar can be added to neutralize the sourness. Lemon will bring a refreshing fragrance to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
The above three are the best ways to drink red card whisky. You can try them as a reference. Hope my introduction can help you.
Education Thinking: How University Exams Can Sort “Superior Students” and “Slippery Students”- Xinhua
Lanzhou Jiaotong University sent three students a letter to express their confusion about the university examination and proposed to increase the difficulty of the examination, change the type of the examination, and make the examination truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, for a long time, university examinations have been a "hot topic".
In the university campus, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability and different levels of study.
For a group with such a diversified feature, it is inevitable to have different feelings.
Of course, if the test questions are simple and repeated, the questions are too easy, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who don't study may pass the examination by突击 before the examination. If they want to study hard, they may achieve better results.
As a result, there is a "poor student" who can pass the exam even though he does not pay much attention in class; and a "good student" who has never missed a class, has good assignments and notes, and also takes good exams.
It seems that the problems reflected by the students of Lanjia University of Technology in the university examination are not without reason, and it is believed that such a situation exists not only in Lanjia University of Technology.
In this sense, I applaud the three students who wrote directly.
In fact, college students who have taken college entrance examinations know that it is quite common for students to study hard and try their best to get the questions from the teacher in order to get the guidance of "special辅导" before the examination. Even taking notes and asking the teacher for mercy after the examination is not a rare case.
In the author's opinion, as a measure of teaching quality assessment, judging whether a university is qualified is more important than judging whether students can pass exams.
In the undergraduate stage of colleges and universities, majors are being subdivided, and many majors are mainly taught with basic knowledge.
It is undeniable that whether you fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a discipline is the content to be tested in university examinations.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theories and basic常识 of the disciplines. From the knowledge point of view, there is not much change. It is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, "You still need to learn the basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years after graduation."
But the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test is single and repetitive.
In many universities, the examination is generally composed of a set of questions by the examination committee, and then the senior teachers of the subject coordinate the composition of the examination papers, and the grading of the examination is also carried out by all teachers in charge of the subject, which can to a certain extent overcome the repetition of the questions.
However, to prepare a set of practical tests in line with the reality of teaching and learning, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall situation of student learning. It also needs to comprehensively master the teaching situation, comprehensively analyze the level of student learning, and thus have a dynamic grasp of difficulty and question type. It can not only highlight the examination of basic knowledge, but also pay attention to the examination of ability. At the same time, the question type should be innovative designed.
Exams are the指挥棒 of university education. What kind of exams students take will have a corresponding preparation plan. Over time, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University has attached great importance to the advice letter of students, and has already deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
It requires the teaching units to organize teachers to carry out the discussion and the course结课 examination comparison self-check, to formulate the examination paper and the related system, and to strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination paper命题 and review process. It also requires to clarify the grading criteria and to strengthen the comprehensive evaluation of the course teaching.
To solve the problems of single test types and repeated questions, the university examination office needs to face the issue, of course, it needs to come up with corresponding systems, but the功夫 is in daily practice, and teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of teaching conditions, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning conditions, and the teaching and learning will be better matched, and a benign interaction will be formed, and the examination will be more in line with reality, so that the "student leader" and "student laggard" can get what they deserve.

Golden Lady Bridal Photography (South Street Store) has not yet opened a branch
Before the photo, we changed the time twice because we did not arrange the time well. The consultant, Lan Lan, was very patient to help us arrange the time.
We chose a good weekend to shoot.
The staff of Mrs. Kim are all superb.
That was my first time to wear makeup in my life. Wow, I can't believe that I will become so pretty one day.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry, I can't remember their names) are very patient in makeup and makeup is very natural.
The scene was filmed in Jianguan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and I didn't feel cold. While taking pictures, the make-up artist occasionally paid attention to our clothes, headgear, and immediately helped us fix any problems.
The photographer was also very humorous, and felt very happy after taking pictures all day.
When we were choosing the photos, we were afraid to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we were choosing the photos, we really were not allowed to add any photos at all. The 24 photos in the package were directly used. (I heard that my cousin who got married at the same time as me took a 7,000-yuan package and added 10,000 yuan of photos, and I was completely shocked and afraid that I would add too many photos at that time)
Today, the photo was repaired, and Lan Lan sent it to me. I saw two photos that were not good, and they immediately helped me to repair them.
Comparing the photos my sister took before, I think our photos are really satisfied. Simple and fresh, that's what I want.
I sincerely recommend that you go to Xuanhan Golden Lady to take wedding photos!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Thank you for your sincere wishes for our happiness and prosperity!

The 3,200 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificate as the special anti-counterfeit paper is out of stock
(Yaba, November 11) The Sarawak National Registration Bureau said that due to the exhaustion of the special anti-counterfeit paper stock, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October, and 3200 people have been affected so far.
However, the Director of the Bureau, Kerameus, assured that all babies who had applied for the birth certificate were recorded in the system. When the counterfeit paper arrived next week, it would be issued again.
At the press conference, he explained the 10-month long report on the paper production of Sabah published by a web media.
He said that the problem had appeared two months ago, and Sarawak also faced the same problem.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeit paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in delivery to China.
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used by Sabah Daily News is different from that of other regions, so the newspaper cannot be borrowed from other states.
Kallimnios revealed that the latest batch of counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on June 6 and was handed over to the printing company on August 8 for partial printing.
The bureau will send a team to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday and return to Sabah immediately to print the last stage. It is estimated that it can be delivered to the applicant by more than two working days (December 20).
We will notify the applicants to go to the local branches to pick up the newspaper.
He added that Sarawak has issued a total of 4801 newspapers so far this year.
Waiting for over 7 hours
Is it coming soon?
I mean food.
I waited on the other side of #PRS_ORG#
Okay, thank you. The restaurant said it was ready.

He believed that China had the ability to hold a great Winter Olympics in special periods; the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee was actively organizing its participation in the Games. The Bosnia and Herzegovina hoped to take this opportunity to carry out more extensive exchanges and cooperation with the Chinese side in the field of sports.
Qi Ping said that China and Poland have a special "olympic bond."
The Winter Olympics in Sarajevo in 1984 was a great success, and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open its doors, presenting a simple, safe and wonderful event to the world.
It is expected that the two countries will deepen exchanges and cooperation in the preparation of winter sports events and the training of athletes. The Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play a bridging role, taking advantage of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, to promote the humanities exchange between the two countries to continue to deepen, so that the people of the two countries can "together look forward to the future", and wish the athletes of Bosnia and Herzegovina good performance in Beijing.
Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the 10th Annual Best Athlete Award Ceremony. Qi Ping, as a special guest, presented the Bosnia and Herzegovina Best Youth Athlete Award.
The video of Beijing Winter Olympic Games was played repeatedly at the scene of the event.

After 48 hours of being negative, China has set up a "buffer zone" to prevent and control the epidemic - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) -- The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, requiring people who have recently left port cities on land borders (except for those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) to have a negative nucleic acid test within 48 hours and to have at least one nucleic acid test after arriving in port cities on land borders.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date of determining the port city scope of each province and city and announcing it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that the port city with conditions could study the establishment of a prevention and control buffer zone in the region.
According to the person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local community. The two sides have frequent exchanges of people.
By implementing a differentiated management policy for分区 and a second line of defense in addition to the first line of defense to prevent the spread of the epidemic, it is expected to achieve the goal of moving the front line of defense and reducing the risk of the epidemic spreading outside the control while achieving the best result in epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local clusters in China, all of which are imported from abroad.
The above-mentioned notice pointed out that this exposed problems such as late epidemic monitoring and early warning, ineffective closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, formal periodic核酸检测, ineffective disinfection of cold chain items, ineffective management of centralized isolation facilities, and ineffective emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that we should focus on improving the prevention and control mechanism of the port city, perfecting the monitoring and early warning system of epidemic, implementing control measures at the border, and other nine aspects in a bid to speed up the improvement of the shortcomings and weaknesses of the prevention and control mechanism of the port city, and make every effort to do a good job in prevention and control in a scientific and precise manner, and weave a strong external prevention and control line.
The notice emphasized that all ports city should synchronously study and deploy the work of epidemic prevention and public security protection, and make public and open the hotline for public security protection, regularly check the potential problems of basic living物资 supply and price, and solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reported by the masses.
According to the notice, the ports referred to include open land, water and air ports, as well as the counties (municipalities, districts and flags) where the ports are located, the cities where the ports are located, and the prefectures (autonomous regions and municipalities) where the ports are located. The specific scope is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and is timely announced.

YouTube video reveals the truth about U.S. military's 20-year killing spree - Xinhua
(Video source: YouTube)
On November 11, a microdocumentary called "Game Machine" on the oil pipe platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of how the United States waged war in Afghanistan under the guise of “fighting terrorism”, and forcibly exported American democracy through the war. For 20 years, the United States waged war with poverty, and its bloodthirsty nature led to the killing of countless innocent people.
The abuse of unmanned aerial vehicles to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places distorts human nature and sets up a killing team.
For 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up a "black prison" to inflict various forms of torture and humiliation on "criminals".
Human rights violations have triggered more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorism" war is "anti-terrorism".
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan, but only a country full of wounds and countless killings and destruction.
Watch the video to uncover the truth that the United States uses the pretext of “fighting terrorism” to carry out bloodthirsty killings and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I happened to see the following article from a commercial perspective as well as from the perspective of the storage period. The author explains why the logistics company in the free trade zone will help the customer to do the canning. Although the canning is a deep processing, it is not within the scope of business operation of the free trade logistics company. The following words may explain the reason why the customer wants to do this.
I have visited many奶粉 manufacturers and touched many奶粉 production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of powdered milk in bags and cans are the same, and there is no difference.
So, everyone must ask: Why is the shelf life of the bagged product one year, while that of the听装 product is two years or longer?
Or they may ask: Why is the price difference between听装 and 袋装 so great?
In fact, many consumers or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
Some consumers also said that the taste or smell of bottled food is different from that of canned food!
Now I will tell you about the reasons for the high price of bottled water and where the high price is.
Why is the price so different?
Because when the price is set by the manufacturer, most of them have considered that if the packaging price is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept. This means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is low, or there is no profit. What does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a big increase in the price of bottled water to ensure their profit space.
Therefore, most manufacturers promote the听装, not the袋装.
And the annual advertising fee of so many manufacturers is several million or even several billion, where does it come from?
You can imagine.
So with the development of society, the costs of promoting the market, such as the promotional staff of shopping malls, the display costs of shopping malls, the costs of products, the costs of gifts and advertising, are also increasing.
Therefore, all manufacturers are also constantly adding new products. And they are all听装. The price is also constantly increasing. In fact, this is a new product with increased market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, their increased costs of raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan.
For some brands, in order to promote their products, they will do anything. They will link up with doctors in hospitals and ask them to assist in the promotion of products. Based on the profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan per bottle.
However, such operation methods are absolutely prohibited by the relevant laws of China. In fact, such practice is only to deceive consumers.
It is recommended that you buy powdered milk in bags if you have a jar at home, which can save costs and increase the storage and sealing of powdered milk, and has no effect on children.
And don't think that the shelf life of the听装 is longer than that of the package. If the shelf life of the package is the same as that of the package after opening, it only means that the package after opening is not easy to store and is easily affected by moisture and spoilage.
The food was cold, then dry and hard, impossible to eat

Don't let people get scared at the starting line - Xinhua
When you are going to the book fair, you will often feel the hottest books of success type.
Successful self-help books today often promote the "principle of the best" - that is, to assume or imply that one can "do" before telling what one needs to do.
It is equivalent to jumping over the actually most important and fundamental link "how to do it".
For this reason, all of these books have a common characteristic: Either do it to the best of your ability at one stroke, or do nothing at all; Either is 100, or is 0; Either climb Mount Tai, or stay put.
This principle of "the best" makes everyone agree that it is "the best", but 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "making a decision and becoming a new person, making a 180-degree turn", which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who are content with the status quo, conservative, and refuse change, you have to shout at their ears that "they should change", which is certainly a form of self-indulgence and playing the fool.
Most people will be afraid of the words "change" and not willing to make a decision; or they will make a decision to change based on their impulses at one time, and bravely take the first step, but it will not last long.
Mr. Ma's famous monologue "From Tomorrow" is a classic that best demonstrates this "common humanity".
The biggest problem of the "optimal principle" is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, making most people "look up and sigh".
Maybe the "next best principle" is the only way to help more ordinary people achieve relative success.
The core of the "rule of second best" is to reduce the threshold. It encourages a theory of "seeking small victory and achieving great victory", that is, if you cannot do 100, you can do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you cannot climb Taibai Mountain, you can climb the small sand dune near your door, because that is always better than standing still.
In general, whatever you do is always better than nothing.
Since the threshold has been greatly reduced, it is more likely for the common people to achieve the perseverance, and the success probability will also increase if they stick to it.
It is just a little bit more difficult than following the principle of "next best thing".
In short, the "optimal principle", though ostensibly aimed at making everyone successful, in fact can only inspire a minority; the "second-best principle" can effectively inspire more people and try to benefit as many people as possible.

Hinggan Lake裸鲤 resource蕴藏量今年增加0.71万吨 - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporter: Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the resource stock of Qinghai Lake裸鲤 has increased by 0.71 million tons this year to 1.085 million tons, with a cumulative growth of more than 40 times compared with the initial protection in 2002.
The common name of the裸鲤 in the Qinghai Lake is "Taoyuan fish". It is a special and precious fish species in the Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the ecological chain of "water - fish - bird" in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to the impact of large-scale human killing and the deteriorating environment of the裸鲤 breeding area, the number of Qinghai Lake裸鲤 has been sharply reduced. In 2002, the resource potential of Qinghai Lake裸鲤 was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake裸鲤 was listed as a vulnerable species in the China Species Red List.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of lakes and the breeding of fish, and has banned any unit, collective and individual from Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake, as well as the sale of裸鲤 and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial reproduction release and cleaning the main entry rivers of Qinghai Lake and designing a scientific and reasonable "passing fish channel", the protection force has been continuously increased, and the resource蕴藏 of Qinghai Lake裸鲤 has been increasing every year.
According to Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, as of now, more than 180 million Qinghai Lake裸鲤 have been released artificially, and the contribution rate of the restoration of Qinghai Lake裸鲤 resources has exceeded 23%.
The Three Gorges Region of Qinghai Province is an important ecological barrier and water source regulation area in China and even Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in western China.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Gorges Source Region and the waters of the Qinghai Lake and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,青海 has successively issued notices on the prohibition of fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake, and built a "one river, one lake" comprehensive fishing management system.

I just saw a long article about menstruation.
科普一下不知道的男性。
Most girls suddenly experience their first menstrual period between the ages of 13 and 15, and menopause occurs around the age of 50.
After that, it will come once a month under the condition of good health.
But it is not a fixed rule that can be precisely predicted. There is a one-week margin of error. It needs to be prepared in advance. Sometimes, bad luck will also cause the boat to capsize (suddenly a few days earlier).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of menstrual pain vary from person to person. Some people have menstrual pain for three days, while others have it for one week. Some people have light menstrual bleeding, while others have heavy menstrual bleeding. Some people have no reaction, while others are so pained that they have to be sent to the ambulance. Menstrual pain will change over time, and menstrual pain will not last forever.
The menstrual blood cannot be controlled, and there is continuous bleeding for 24 hours during the few days before and after menstruation. The only thing one can do is to suck the blood to prevent it from flowing on clothes and chairs.
The main reason for menstrual pain is the secretion of prostaglandin. It is effective to take ibuprofen as soon as possible before the onset of menstrual pain to relieve menstrual pain. It is useless to take it after the onset of menstrual pain.
During the menstrual period, due to the overinflation of the uterus and the excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to suffer from diarrhea.
If you suddenly have diarrhea around the time of your period, it will probably come within two days.
The sanitary napkin should be changed every two to three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Apart from sleeping time, the worst case is that it is changed six times a day, for seven days a month, that is 42 pieces. If it is prepared in advance, it may be 50 pieces. It is not used every month.
(Here is a modification. The tampon can be used for 5-6 hours before being changed. The longest period is 8 hours.)
The hormones during the menstrual period might make women more irritable, while the changes of hormones in the body during the ovulation might cause emotional instability, which is really unfortunate. The body plays tricks on women.
However, the official crime rate data can show that the ability of women to control emotions is very high, and they will not find excuses for emotional problems.
It is not only blood that flows, but also the detached uterine mucosa.
After the menstrual period, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house, and the house is built (the endometrium thickens) every month to prepare for the guests. The guests do not come, and all the houses are demolished (the menstrual blood is discharged). The new houses are built again next month, and the cycle continues.
The menstrual period is very inconvenient. For decades, it bleeds for a few days every month and causes abdominal pain and lower back pain. Who wants that?
But you can only be born because your mother has her period. Periods are for the ten months you will live in this world. We should thank our mothers for having healthy and regular periods.
In the past, many things were suppressed for women. The society brainwashed women to think that they were filthy, shameful, and everyone thought so. But times have changed.
If someone thinks that menstruation is disgusting, and thinks that the preparatory behavior of the female body for the preparation of life is disgusting, it should not be said in public. Girls stand up, and don't think like that. Men, who have never experienced it, will never experience it, and don't know much about it, don't deserve to be so ungrateful and disrespectful. How can you face your mother and want your children?
Finally, try the tampon sisters, it really works.
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival. It is disappointing to send the wrong one.
We have to order a meal for the little boy.
It is hoped that the store will check the quality of products in its spare time.
Do you feel tingling when you take a foot bath?
Choosing the right foot bath can have a good effect on foot therapy and health. Today, Guomei editor will answer this question and help you.
With people's health awareness increasing, foot bath basins are becoming more and more favored by consumers. There are also a large number of products of different grades in the market, ranging from more than RMB 100 to thousands of yuan. This gives consumers a lot of choice.
According to the relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of foot baths and other health-related household appliances are hot, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there is a certain safety hazard.
It's really too dangerous to soak your feet in the electric water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt numb when he was taking a bath.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he did not expect to turn off the vibration function and his father still felt numb in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pencil and it worked. Surprised, Mr. Li found that the water in the foot bath was electric.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was good. Although he cancelled the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that this well-established foot bath has no clear and detailed industry regulations on temperature setting, target group, and materials guarantee to be safe.
However, generally speaking, foot baths are unlikely to have electrical problems. However, it is not excluded that a few products are not strictly controlled at the factory.
Therefore, choose a separate foot bath when buying.
The separation of water and electricity has no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take a digital multimeter to measure.
The opening ceremony of the 13th Provincial Tea Expo - Viewpoint Top News - Hunan Daily Online
Hunan Daily News, December 10 (reported by Zhang Shangwu, Hu盼盼, Liu Xiaoling, photo Li Jian) - This morning, the 13th Hunan tea exposition and new化 red tea promotion meeting were held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center. The exhibition of the tea industry, innovative tea technology, the promotion of tea culture, and the acceleration of the goal of reaching a billion yuan in the tea industry.
Huo Shuyang, deputy director of the Council of the China National Supply and Cooperation Association, and Ye Hongzhong, deputy secretary of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony.
Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand introduction at the opening ceremony. He said that the source of Lake Hongyu is in Xinyang, and the rise of red tea has given new impetus to the “Five Colored Xiang Cha”.
In recent years, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion yuan Xiang tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "three Xiang, four water, five color tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation. Green tea, black tea, and red tea are the main tea types. The main production areas promote the integration of tea and travel, and drive the vast majority of tea farmers to increase income.
风水轮流转，红茶再次发力。
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after harvesting green tea, they harvested red tea and black tea. Tea farmers had income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens rose steadily.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises entitled to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark. Xinhua喜捧"湖红之源"。
At the Fujian Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants were attracted to a high-altitude tea called "Bingli Spring" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Qiang, Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said with a smile that the current epidemic and other factors have to some extent affected the tea market, but judging from the scene of the tea expo, there are many highlights.
Xinyue Red Tea is a bright red color, and it has injected the connotation of tea culture. It is popular and trading is hot. Xiang tea industry welcomes a new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be canceled?
I don't want it, because there is no place to park below, and he failed to deliver it.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational deduction and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic principle of philosophy, aimed at explaining the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" comes from the sentence of "metaphysics" in the Book of Changes, "metaphysics metaphysics, which is above, is called the之道, which is below is called the器", and was translated by Japanese person井上哲次郎 (M明治时代).
The metaphysical branch includes ontology, natural theology, and its extensions.
The essence of ontology is "to study which nouns represent real existence entities and which only represent a concept".
Metaphysical naturalism, which denies the existence of God.

It studies what kind of moral behavior guidelines people should follow), applied ethics (academic discipline that applies ethical theories to actual living conditions, including bioethics and political ethics), and descriptive ethics (gathers information about how people live, and makes generalizations from observed patterns).
It does not start from the expected theory of ethics, but investigates the real choices made by actual moral agents (moral agents) and observed. It promotes all the moral factors that lead to this decision. It studies the ethical view held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.
Part I: The Ethical Thought of Humanism, with representatives such as Vala and Montaigne.

Di Zilin: To my friends.
I sincerely thank all my friends for the humanitarian aid they gave to us during the 30 years after our family members died. Especially since I made a humanitarian appeal to friends both at home and abroad on the personal behalf in 1994, such aid has never stopped.
Nowadays, most of the dead parents have passed away, and the orphan children have also grown up and worked.
It was your act of kindness that helped us, the families of the victims, through the most difficult times.
At present, the coronavirus epidemic is ravaging the world, and most of the donors have reached the age of retirement.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to suspend the humanitarian donations to the mothers of Tiananmen Square, which should have been a perfect sentence.
I will always remember your love and believe that your义举 will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
The Tile Industry: Let me take this opportunity to briefly introduce the history of 32 years of humanitarian relief carried out by the IFCSS (全美学自联) and the MCDF (明尼苏达中国民主基金会).
In the process of humanitarian relief, the US All-China Federation of Students and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the implementers of projects often cross.

The relief funds often cannot be smoothly delivered to the hands of the six-four relatives.
In 1994, after Mr. Ding's suggestion, a special group was set up by "Mothers in Tiananmen Square" to coordinate and manage the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, the MCDF established the Education Fund for the Orphans of June 4, and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, all the orphans of June 4 had graduated from college, the MCDF then established the Special Assistance Fund for the Orphans of the Elderly of June 4, and has continued to implement it ever since.
The funds for these projects come mainly from donations from campus and society in the year of the Six-Day War, from the generosity of individuals, and are supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Correctional Research Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the六四 victims finally received part of the donations that were collected in Hong Kong in the name of六四.
Meanwhile, China Human Rights also independently carried out its humanitarian relief projects during this period.
We understand that Mr. Ding called off the六四 donation for the donors' consideration. We are indeed retired old people. Our income is not as abundant as that before retirement. We are grateful to Mr. Ding for his letter to his friends.
We will respect the decisions of the bereaved and terminate the project within two years and resume as needed.
We would like to extend our gratitude and respect to those comrades who have been generous and brave in delivering humanitarian aid over the years, putting themselves at risk.

Photo effect: took two sets of clothes Overall, it is not bad. I prefer the picture set.
Service details: It is not comfortable to wear makeup while pregnant. The makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest for a while. They kept pouring hot water for me to drink.
Package price: 1000 yuan
Thank you, the rabbit. I thought it was not suitable for the ancient style. I did not expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for your recognition. Your satisfaction will make us full of energy to continue to move forward. We will continue to push forward!
This photography studio is really great. I highly recommend it to all my friends.
The reception, makeup, costume, lighting, photography and post-production are all flawless.
The make-up artist is very delicate, and will match your style to create a suitable makeup for you. The cosmetics used are also first-class big brands.
The teacher Tian Liang is even more professional in photography.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and there are two small cats playing together.
We work in Beijing. The better photo studios in Beijing need to queue for half a year in advance. My colleagues have taken photos in Beijing. I looked at the finished product and found it was just so-so.
I found this studio intentionally, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, and we feel that this is also the shortcoming of most people. The photographer, Lee Kuan, will snap the moment and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Make-up artist, photographer, post-production designer, a good team.
When it comes out, we all praise it highly.
I have recommended my friend to go there before and my friend just saw the negatives and was equally delighted.
It is hoped that this kind of workshop will not be buried, and more people will discover it, so that it can have its own style and not be a mere copy.
Thank you so much for your five-star comments! You are both very talented and creative new people. We are a creative studio, and we will do our best to complete the job as long as the customer likes it. Thank you for knowing each other.
The sweet and considerate assistant and the lively and outgoing photographer teacher, everyone in the team is super nice It was a wonderful time to be a photographer, and it was a very memorable experience, and the results were much better than I expected. Thank you so much!
Thank you for your comments, Xiao Yu. It is also a kind of缘分 to meet you. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, our trust is the same as the distance of thousands of kilometers. I am happy to meet you. We will come to Qinhuangdao again next time.

Someone who wants to share their personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't have such ideas, it is better to learn by yourself. After all, the cost of training is very high and it takes 6 months to learn.
However, if you plan to get into this industry, training is indeed a good choice. Especially for those who are self-disciplined and weak. Training is a good choice.
If you have a strong self-control, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we need to check the teacher strength of the institution. If the teacher strength is not strong enough, the training institution will have little meaning. Of course, some newly opened training institutions have not strong teacher strength.
Secondly, it is recommended to inquire about the training institution before making a choice. The students who have graduated from this institution will tell you the truth about the institution.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't introduced your own situation. And the study of this thing is very related to the personal situation.
For example, professional, age, the language you want to learn, and even in which city, all of these will be related to the industry you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated or a computer major who has graduated, I would personally recommend self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but the cost of learning is high, and the investment of time is more, which basically needs to be concentrated for 3 to 6 months.
However, if it is the situation I mentioned above, self-study is very convenient. There are many free online learning resources on the Internet, or you can also go to Bilibili for many training resources. If you don't know where to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources or detailed consultations.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with videos to learn.
If you are not a computer major, but you can pay a certain amount of study money and time cost, then it is recommended to learn in a training institution. This will not be very difficult and the teacher will also explain in detail. There will also be help in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, with internal promotion quotas, and recommend students to companies after learning, so that the interview process of looking for jobs can also save a lot of things.
The above is some of my views. The introduction above is not detailed because I don't know your situation. If you have other questions to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said that I would be there at 1 PM, and I saw it on the app.
What is it?
I haven't finished yet, what are you doing?
I, undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, repair), wall-mounted boiler hot water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, oil smoke machine, light fixture, glass cleaning, home service
Thank you for those who are silent and give me a thumbs-up. I am tired but I will continue to strive for my life.

Every stage of life will encounter different problems.
Frequently, it is the courage to confront difficulties that holds you back.
Now that we can't avoid it, let's just face it.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; the more you face difficulties, the easier it will be.
Chinese and Saudi curators to jointly host Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter: Wang Haidong, Hu Gaban) Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial - The Dirie Contemporary Art Biennial was officially opened to the public on the 11th day of the 12th month in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, by 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China.
The biennale is jointly curated by the Saudi Diyar Foundation and the UCCA Yulin Contemporary Art Center in China. Yulin Yulin holds the post of Director of the UCCA Yulin Contemporary Art Center.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "crossing the river with stones in hands", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the economic and social transformation period and reflects the current condition of Saudi society and culture.
The biennial exhibition covers nearly 12,000 square meters and is displayed in six interconnected buildings, each of which presents one of the following units: "Going with the Flow", "Experimenting with Inheritance", "Reflective边缘思考", "Art for the Public", "The New Beauty World," and "The Spirit of Art."
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including painting, installation art and performance art; the works of 12 Chinese artists are also very popular, and some artists use novel ways to create with recycled materials, for example, Xu Bing used discarded materials to reconstruct a classic landscape painting in his series "Story behind the scenes" (2014).
Barclay, the chief executive of the Derry Biennale Foundation, said that he hoped that this biennale would establish international dialogue and allow global audiences to have the opportunity to understand the flourishing cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interactive exchanges.
Tian Fuyou said, "The dual purpose of the biennial is to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that during the opening week of the biennial, a series of lectures will be held. Artists, curators, and thought leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as intercultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public service positions - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bingfeng) In order to continue to do a good job in supporting the employment of poverty-stricken people and consolidating and expanding the achievements of poverty eradication, Yunnan province recently issued relevant policies to promote the revitalization of rural areas and the management of public service positions in rural areas to help fully promote the revitalization of rural areas.
According to the person in charge of the Human Resources and Social Security Department of Yunnan Province, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 44.83 million rural public welfare positions to help employment of rural poor labor force and other rural difficult groups. It plays an important role in helping the poor to increase income, consolidate the achievements of poverty eradication, effectively improve the ability of various rural public services and other aspects.
The new regulation is issued jointly by seven departments including the Human Resources and Social Security of Yunnan, rural revitalization, finance and other departments. It is aimed at providing a unified standard for the recruitment of personnel for rural public service positions at the grassroots, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions.
In terms of job development and setting, the new regulation makes it clear that jobs will be developed according to the principles of "setting jobs according to need, determining people by jobs, dynamic management and overall control" and "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person, one job, voluntary publicity, unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, filing, examination, publicity, appointment, on-the-job training and arrangement for taking on the job.
In addition, the new regulation also clarifies the specific duties of the main development departments of rural public service positions, the subsidy standard and subsidy mode of rural public service positions, and stipulates that the development departments of rural public service positions should purchase accidental damage commercial insurance for rural public service positions; requires relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution of rural public service positions.
The address is wrong.
Hello.
Can you cancel the order?
I re-ordered.
Is it cancelled?
Second, although the right has a period of prosperity in history, it is not long, so it is short because it is like a flower in the sunshine, and it will sweat if you give it a little water; if it gets a little success, it will look for the next big thing.
But to be honest, the right has played a positive role in social progress.
From the definition of the truth standard of the end of the Cultural Revolution to the development of economy and the improvement of science and technology to the promotion of political systemization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right should not be denied.
As for me, although I do not completely agree with Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statements and also respect him as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also serious about Chinese social issues.
However, I oppose his anti-communist theory, and I think that anti-essentialist revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage people's livelihood, and make political groups a mess. In addition, foreign countries will take advantage of this.
Fourth, change or improve China with patience and attitude of responsibility to the country and the people. Those who try to make a political profit in the fire are not the rightists, but the bastards.
Let's talk about left.
On the left, in fact, it is a group of time and political orphans.
If the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will also listen to some right opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has no choice but to give up because the left wants what the Communist Party is throwing away!
Fifth, recently I have seen some friends fighting against the enemy while refuting the leftist madness, and I think it is quite unnecessary.
Do not try to talk to the traitor and the leftist. They are all one-sided and have no reason to talk.
Do not try to prove that we are right, and do not think that the adversaries and leftists will admit it. Why?
I told my friends like this: When the counterfeiters insulted you five cents, and the left-footed men insulted you right dogs, it just proved that our middle way was right!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but forget them when they grow old, or pursue ideals but become delusional.
And the ideal is gradually getting farther and farther away, and even the dragon boy will become a dragon.
I think it generally means restraint and freedom. From the historical and cultural先天 gene of China, China should be to the left.
The right wing in China pays more attention to efficiency and development, while the left wing strengthens regulation and pays more attention to fairness and safety.
At present, the general society hopes to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time, China and the United States are competing. Left is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, I just like to like it.
Nothing to say, flowers are just like that
In the past two years, the blockade and encirclement by the United States of Huawei's chips have not only left Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses for "US-style" enterprises.
The United States has suppressed the Chinese chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and allies to block the Chinese chip industry at the same time. The direct result is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, and the research and development investment of chip production enterprises is reduced, resulting in a decrease in global chip supply chain.
Now, the "芯" shortage has affected every industry in the world, such as the suspension of car production and the rise in mobile phone prices. All industries that use chips have suffered greatly.
In order to master the "芯片" independence, more and more countries' science and technology giants are beginning to take the road of "going away from the United States".
In order to firmly grasp the global semiconductor control rights and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has been taking actions frequently. It is not only the "IC Summit" host, but also invites 64 major companies to set up a semiconductor alliance, and allocates funds to support the US domestic technology giants. For example, the US old technology giant Intel has spent US$20 billion to build two wafer processing factories in Arizona, USA, and open the chip manufacturing business.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and probably steal its "job".
This is because Intel, as a veteran US technology giant, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor industry for decades and has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves. It is certain to rise quickly and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Founder TSMC Chang Cheng-mok did not pay much attention to this decision of Intel.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmu made a surprising statement. Without any hesitation, Zhang Zhongmu said: Intel is building a chip factory, which is quite讽刺.
Zhang Zhongmogave Intel a cold shoulder because he still had a grudge against TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was always the bright star in the manufacturing industry of the United States, standing at the top of the world. It was the ruler of the world in the field of semiconductor.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were in the hands of a few powerful people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, in which the chip was completed by a factory from design to packaging and testing. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model is too heavy for some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are only able to look away in the face of huge production line construction costs.
Under the influence of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show the phenomenon of division and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmogot heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, then it can be set up a special chip manufacturing factory.
Shortly thereafter, Chang's idea became a reality, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was born.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. focused on the single link of "wafer processing" and only provided the subcontract service of wafer manufacturing.
At that time, newly founded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. was just a lowly subordinate to the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmogang asked Intel Investment, but Intel heard that Taiwan Semiconductor only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it was obviously high self-esteem, despised Taiwan Semiconductor, and resolutely refused to invest in Taiwan Semiconductor.
Zhang Zhongmu also believes that Intel was arrogant at the time.
I had no idea that the giants who despised the wafer manufacturing services had to start doing the wafer manufacturing themselves.
So, it was very讽刺 when Intel entered the wafer fabrication.
Today, the market value of Taiwan Semiconductor has exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of the strong attack of Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel is naturally not willing to be stagnant.
Today, TSMC has been racing towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 7 years ago 14nm.
It is not easy to catch up.
Not waiting
I ordered at 19:06.
Today, let's look at some strange hot searches.
What is normal public opinion?
Here are the top three trending topics in a random order: February 2 dragon rising, Goodie increasing prices, and the event of Shuailala, public opinion will spread and form a peak, then the index will decrease (smooth the curve) until it disappears. If there is secondary public opinion, there will be a small dune peak again.
They look the same as the "Internet public opinion evolution model" presented on the official website of the Internet Information Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Here are six popular topics from the same event in the form of "peaks," "scissors," and "valley."
The "peaks" are artificially heated and become popular topics in a short time; the "teeth" are periodically heated to ensure that the popular topics stay on the hot search list. The "valley" is the collective evacuation, which makes the popular topics finish the "function" and then takes on new tasks and moves to new battlefields.
In Figure 9, the heat wave of an event is exactly the trough of another event. The time is second by second. It is certain that a unified batch of water troops received orders and launched a new round of attacks.
It can be seen from the specialization of black public relations: dozens of hot searches are listed at the same time, and which attracts attention, which is responsible for popularization, which leads to war, which转移s attention, which affects cognition, which misleads judgment, which煽动s emotion, and which is involved in decision-making. Black production accounts take turns and nodes to fight in detail, taking into account almost all the elements of public opinion transmission and diffusion.
Communication is a science, and regardless of one's position and emotions, if we only look at the objective data, the black PR will also have nowhere to hide.
Every step we take will leave a mark. Such a mark, let's dig it out together.
Data source: hot search time machine.
Mauritius and other countries have found the first cases of infection with the Oligarch virus - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 (reported by foreign correspondents): Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the Covid variant virus Omicron, Xinhua News Agency reported.
Mauritius reported two cases of infection with the Oicergon virus for the first time on the 10th.
According to Kailash Jagutpal, the Minister of Health of Mauritius, one infected person is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th; the other is a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive after being in contact with a person who recently visited South Africa.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the two infected people have both turned negative in their nucleic acid tests. They have now returned to their respective residences.
Cyprus' Ministry of Health announced on the 10th day of the month that the country has confirmed its first three cases of infection with the Ommicron virus.
These three people are students. They returned from abroad earlier this month. Since they were mild cases, they did not go to hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omink virus, the S government has continuously increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers aged 12 and above arriving at the airport by plane will have to pay for a nucleic acid test.
On the 10th, the Saudi Ministry of Health also announced that it would start to vaccinate children aged 5 to 11 years old with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
On the 9th, the Minister of Health of Malawi, Qumbizhe Chimbonda, said that the country has found its first three cases of infection with the Omyakon virus.
The country's health sector sequenced the genomes of 12 Covid-19 samples collected from November 9 to February 2 and discovered the three infected cases.

Address:幸福家园12楼156号
At first, it was introduced by friends because of trust. So I chose to come and have a look. My budget was RMB 70,000 for a basic renovation.
He came to the store and began a series of fraud.
I was the first time to the store. I just showed my floor plan to them. They did not measure the house in person. They said that my 135-room house could be solved at RMB70,000. They gave me a rough estimate of their materials.
Their second trick is that if you just go to the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and the money once paid will never come back to you, unless you have enough experience and can fight the theory).
When I was hesitant about whether to pay a deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that you could get a certain amount of discount just by paying the deposit today.
This is a big pit, and I am a living example of being deceived. When my mind was filled with impulses, I paid more than 10,000 yuan in advance.
He gave me a lot of questions about the price, which did not include the renovation of water and electricity, including any doors and cupboards in the bathroom, and these were the main parts of the basic package.
In addition, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies.
I lost trust in this company, and I did not sign the contract until everything was clear.
When I went to ask for my money back, they showed a lot of experience. There are special small teams to deal with you.
In any case, it is the customer's problem, and they have no responsibility.
All kinds of excuses were made, and there were many details I didn't want to say. In short, don't choose them. My friend also chose them to renovate his house, and the quality was also bad. He will charge you various fees in the later stage.
Damn, they are the original leading decoration that deceives people. Now they have changed to big beauty, but it seems that they have changed again and again.
So you should not choose such a deceiving construction company.
In the future, when people choose, they can look up these things on Baidu and ask for advice because decoration is not a small amount of money.

Okay, don't cancel the conversation. If I haven't refunded you within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely hold you responsible.

Starry Night - Gemini流星雨 to arrive at its peak on August 14 - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) -- Astronomers explained that the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere this year, will reach its peak on December 14, and fans of meteor showers can make observations after that.
Beijing astronomers An Jiu took this photo of the Gemini流星雨 on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai Province.
Most meteor showers are associated with periodic comets, but the mother body of the Gemini meteor shower is the 3200 asteroids Faero, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "breeded" by a comet.
According to Shu Lipeng, the member of the Astronomical Society of China and the expert of the popularization of astronomy, just like the new year blockbuster, the Gemini流星雨 usually appears at the end of the year, and "the release schedule" can be kept from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is well known for its large and stable流量. It is together with the Perseids and the Leonids known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
The significant characteristic of the Gemini流星雨 is that the流星体 speed is slow, colorful, and there are many fireballs. It is suitable for beginners in both visual observation and astronomical photography.
On December 13, 2020, Yang Jing, an amateur astronomer in Tianjin, took a photograph of the Gemini流星雨 in Tianjin Baoshou.
According to astronomical forecasts, the Gemini流星雨 will arrive at its peak on December 14 at about 15:00, when the ZHR is expected to reach 150.
The recommended index chart of the Gemini流星雨.
Last year, the Gemini流星雨 of "Flower Fever" left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini流星雨 will be affected by the moon, and the beauty will be slightly reduced.
On the 14th, it is the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar. The moon will be盈凸月, which will cause bright moonlight to interfere with observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall down in the late night. At this time, the radiant point of the Gemini流星雨 will also rise higher.
Fans of meteor showers can observe them in the hours after the moon sets, but should beware of hypothermia. "
How can we observe more meteorites?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a location at a high altitude, with little light pollution and with a wide view towards the northeast. You can then patiently wait for the moon to set and observe by sight.
It should be noted that the流量 of the Gemini流星雨 is very large in all directions. When observing, it is not necessary to keep looking at the radiation point of the Gemini流星雨.
If you are a fan of photography, you should choose a wide-angle and a large aperture lens to take pictures of starry night, and use a high ISO and the maximum aperture.
For stability and continuity, a tripod, a spare battery and a shutter line are also necessary. "
Xiao Lin reminded.
What are the differences between the market positioning of laser TVs and traditional TVs?
As far as I understand, the traditional TV referred to by the questioner should be the LCD TV. The differences between the laser TV and the LCD TV in the market positioning are mainly as follows:
First, laser TVs are more focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products born for the large screen.
At present, the mainstream LCD TV sizes are generally 55-65 inches, while laser TV sizes are generally 75 inches and above, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting the user's demand for a large screen TV.
In recent years, the global shipment and sales share of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the overall TV sales of more than 80 inches.
According to the prediction of Zhongyi Kang, the sales growth of the laser TV market will exceed 140% in 2020, and continue to maintain high growth.
The success of the big screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in protecting eyes.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source is not directly injected into the eye. Compared with the backlight source of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the natural condition of the object's imaging process. The stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
Through a strict comparison experiment of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions in the population, the laboratory of the China Institute of Electronics Technology Standardization and the Department of Ophthalmology of Beijing Tongren Hospital obtained 144 test data.
The data confirm that the laser TV indeed has strong eye protection characteristics and even has certain improvement in certain aspects.
At a time when eye health is gaining more and more attention, laser TVs not only attract more and more users with their eye-friendly advantages, but also open up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuous dropping price of LCD TVs, the price of laser TVs on the market is generally more than 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price is gradually climbing.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It is certainly reasonable.
With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projector cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, laser TV's projection distance is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment. It can realize 100-inch screen experience at a short distance, and the required space is not big. The main body is small and occupies little space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
In addition, with a lower heat capacity, it will cause less damage to the equipment and the TV will last longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models also carry many cutting-edge technologies such as real 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, and仿生 screen, which can bring users a more shocking visual and auditory experience.
It is not a fake demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input/output ratio, the laser TV is not the dish of gamers who want to have both a large screen and a good viewing environment. If you want to have both, you can try. There are pros and cons to everything, and you can make your own judgment after weighing up the advantages and disadvantages. The problem is that you just listen to one side.
In short, the ultra-wide projection lens - laser TV, in order to be close to the screen, had to use the expensive ultra-wide lenses and mirrors, which was not in line with the best optical design.
To block part of the environmental light, the use of micro-structure Fresnel screen is very expensive, and the price of a 80-inch screen can basically replace a 65-inch LCD.
And one more thing, I really dislike when the projection manufacturer took the good of漫反射 for the eyes as the selling point. Please, the light for the eyes is the direct light on the screen when the eyes can see it. You diffuse to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it either. If you insist on comparing the LCD TV with the "spotlight", don't you think the light from the TV will also illuminate the ceiling?
And, if the projector screen is not a漫反射, it will not become like.
It was just ignored the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen. A lot of light was reflected to the eyes in a certain angle, which was really uncomfortable.
Visual Art Photography Gallery has selected quality stores. At present, there are no branches
When I added WeChat to make an appointment, the sister sent me the arrangement of the time I could choose. She replied quickly.
Before going, I had looked at the store's photography works, more of which were outdoor wedding photos, which were very beautiful, and involved many shooting styles.
When I arrived that day, I had a simple chat with the sister, and she was very patient to help me try on two sets of my indecisive style clothes. Finally, we decided to start the make-up and hair styling. The photographer would set some props before shooting, and guide the action. He would also be quite demanding in details.
However, it may be because I did not exchange specific shooting ideas with you, so the style I shot was not what I wanted, but it should be pretty.
After the photo is taken, the photographer will help choose the photos, and communicate the style of post-production, which is quite considerate.
The repaired film takes about half a month to wait for the effect.
I won the second prize in a photo shoot. Most of the clothes in the photo shoot are available for selection.
Finally, she chose a black silk dress to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about two hours. The makeup + shooting. The photographer who takes care of the shooting is the younger brother of the 95s. I feel a little shy. I hope that in the future, I can give more suggestions to the customers about the action guidance. He is quite talkative. The shooting process is rather pleasant.
Visual Art Photography Gallery Select Quality Store
On the home page, let's also take a look at Queenie.
We filled in our names and phone numbers first, and then chose our outfits. We were allowed to choose our bridal dresses as well. She was quite patient while we changed our outfits. After we chose our outfits, she spent a long time on make-up. The service was also very good. We were told how to pose by the photographer. However, our faces turned out to be quite large, and the fine-tuned photo showed no difference from the original photo, which was sent in less than a week.
The environment is generally good.
There are many optional clothes.
There are three make-up positions, and the inside is a photo studio.
The service is very warm and careful.
The designer was very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the action very seriously.
If the photographer is not satisfied with the result, he will also propose to do a repeat shoot.
Experience: The shape may be a little too exaggerated. The originally double eyelid was given a triple eyelid.
The eyebrows were also trimmed, which was a little embarrassing for me because I don't usually wear makeup.
The picture has been given for more than ten days, but I am not satisfied with the effect of P图. I feel that the double eyelid tape is still obvious.
I didn't know what I wanted so I tried on two different styles and ended up choosing the black dress. The little sister said this style was more in the vintage赫本风
After choosing the clothes, I began to do my make-up and hair. The hairdresser and makeup artist were both very patient and helped me a lot. I was very satisfied with the result.
After doing my make-up and hair, we started taking pictures. The photographer directed me to pose throughout the whole process. It was very easy and harmonious.
After the shoot, I carefully selected the four most favorite photos for the fine-tuning. The little brother said that it will be ready for use within 15 days. I am very satisfied with the result.
No reply for 3 days... Since your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that every time I pay, I use the same credit card
I have to pay the shipping fee now.
Can I be exempted from paying the monthly fee after your investigation?
Is it safe to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Xiaoyu伞是一个互联网保险经纪平台。
From the perspective of the setting conditions: according to the guidance of the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokers (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance broker, it must meet three key words: shareholders, founders must have no major violations of the law for the past three years, the minimum amount is RMB 50 million, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are actually very demanding. In summary, it requires strength, has been approved by the national authority department of the National Insurance and Bank Regulatory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks across the country), the shareholders should have a good reputation, and as an insurance broker, the small umbrella insurance, the insurer need not worry too much about whether the small umbrella insurance is legitimate or not, because there are these three thresholds.
At this point, it is not bad, and it is worth trusting.
From the perspective of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is a insurance supermarket, and many companies' star critical illness insurance is sold on this platform. For example, the latest to be listed and Tai Super Mario 5 star critical illness insurance, the insurer and the insurer are the same as the Tai Life, and small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so it is not questioned its credibility.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products are generally more affordable because there are less operating costs and salary costs of businessmen. And the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of the insured, and at the same time, it can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the point of view of the professionalism of businessmen: this is particularly important, because insurance is a highly professional industry. Many Internet products can be insured by the customers themselves, so there will be many misunderstandings. In the aspect of health declaration and occupations, the non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective意识 when they insure themselves, and think that they are healthy or meet the requirements, which may lead to many risks of denied claims.
I used to do insurance phone sales for “Tencent微保” (just like the little umbrella, also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I can tell you with great responsibility.
The insurance of Internet is real and reliable. Unreliable is human. There are no professional staff in Internet channels. There are also a lot of sales misguidance.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 600,000 yuan, buying insurance will give you a mobile phone, free 6 million yuan of critical illness insurance, and these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the main point, and do not tell the insured that the first month's 1 yuan is the same as the second month's, and the amount varies from几十 to 200, and many customers have paid for two years and do not know what they have bought.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan and the insurance company would pay 60 million yuan (the world is falling down).
Free mobile phones are given to subscribers whose policy numbers end in certain special numbers, such as 66666, and if the winning SMS is sent but the subscriber does not redeem the mobile phone, no one will remind him.
(This is another hole for the insurer to fall into) Getting a free insurance of RMB 60,000 for diseases is a short-term measure. If only this, there is no other commercial insurance. What should RMB 60,000 do if there is a real disease? It cannot solve the problem. Our life will be started from now on.
At present, the state is also cracking down on the misconduct of Internet insurance sales.
Therefore, in summary, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, and the problem is the professionalism and integrity of the businessmen.
It is recommended that the subject consider the overall situation. In fact, the products of many offline insurance brokerages are more extensive, and the opportunities and products for customers to choose are more. Some products also have a better price than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet clients, insured the offline products, and saved 2000-3000 yuan/year for each person.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker, with 3 years of enterprise management training experience, served more than a thousand enterprise users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies, before insurance, I will start from the needs of the customers to customize the insurance products for them, during the insurance period, I will do a bidding for the customers to try to get the best underwriting results, after insurance, I will do the compilation of the insurance contract and the custody, so that the customers can feel safe and worry-free.
To grow together with every customer.
I hope my answer can help the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance procedures autonomously after clicking the insurance link provided by the insurer.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the insurer.
Although Internet insurance is not very "ceremonial", and even may not have a printed copy of the contract, it does not affect the effectiveness and legality of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the general assembly line of "telephone sales", but there is also a fatal problem in buying insurance, that is, the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract of several decades. When we buy insurance, should we think carefully about the "mediator" we choose? Is it an "insurer" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services for us many years later?

No problem, remember that there is no need to arrange a resend, I have bought it elsewhere and do not want to waste
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of slander and insult, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can accommodate everything, but we should eliminate such villains.
If you don't look at parties and factions, the first thing to be opposed is this uncivilized style.
From when you start requesting to be friends on Facebook to when you make fun posts to when you try to put the address of my home and the name of my father on social media, I have taken no response.
Afterwards, you not only continued to tag me according to the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss about some hidden and humiliating words about me with your so-called friends on Facebook. Comments such as facial features, body shape, good breeding, and comments about whether to plant strawberries on bed and so on. I... also gave up.
I didn't know that later, I received a lot of friends who sent me a picture of your face book friends and a statement with sexual harassment.
I'm sorry, but as a girl, I can't continue to be silent.
After uploading the news about my calling the police, you have not only gone on the rampage, but also become more and more insolent.
I don't care about your political background or your status, in our society, we need to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue to engage in this type of banter, ambiguity, humiliation, and insult. You can also continue to say that you only care about and concern me. You can continue to think that it is not harassment. You can even continue to deny that it is not your creation or that it is not offensive.
No, I can't and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you, and my appearance and body shape don't need you to comment.
I don't even think there would be any girl who would be willing to let others humiliate themselves in this way in order to gain fame.
My friend asked me how I was.
I said yes, and you wouldn't believe me.
I don't think any girl can say she is fine after being bullied like that.
Only those who have no basic ethics in work, society, politics or business will choose this way to hurt any woman.
I believe that justice will prevail.
I cut some comments for you to judge
No one can impersonate you since you posted it yourself.
I can only say that you are a civilized enemy

Vietnam People’s Daily Online - Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc attended the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum

The surrounding area is not so good, and the number of hardware stores in hotels and restaurants is few. In addition, the restaurant's taste is average.
This elevator is also very meaningless. Like having a big disease, it goes down to minus two and back up to minus one, and I have to stop at this floor. I can't go down to the lobby from the safe passage. It's also very meaningless. I can go straight to a furniture store. When the furniture store is closed, I can't go out of the safe passage!

Yangtze River mainstream achieves full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service area - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) Chongqing, the Lichuan Water Green Integrated Service Area in Chongqing, was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th day of the month. This is the second water green integrated service area in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to be officially put into operation after the Lichuan Water Green Integrated Service Area in Sichuan Province was listed on operation on the 8th day of the month.
Up to now, the water-based green comprehensive service area has covered the Yangtze River upstream, midstream and downstream.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Ministry of Transportation Yangtze River Navigation Administration, said that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces had already built and operated 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which had been recognized by the vast majority of the crew and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the water-based green integrated service area is another milestone event in the construction of green shipping in the Yangtze River. The Yangtze River has significantly improved its ability to receive and ship pollutants.
According to reports, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility that provides all-round production and living services for ships and crew members to help crew members solve the problems of "urgency, difficulty and anxiety".
The two water-based green integrated service areas built and put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are integrated with living, production and government services, and focus on the theme of green and environmental protection, with ship maintenance and ship emergency rescue services as a special feature, so as to realize that the ships in the Yangtze River dock at one time, and provide multiple services, which will make the crew working on the Yangtze River throughout the year more efficient and convenient.
U.S. Three Aircraft Carriers Concentrate in the Region of China and the Strongest Weapon is Rare to Visits Guam 2022-01-17 Đa Vi- A亲中共媒体 Đa Vi: Latest news on Sino-US relations: latest satellite images show that the U.S. Three Aircraft Carriers are concentrating in the region of China; the U.S. media also revealed that one of the strongest weapons in the U.S. Navy arsenal has a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to the allies and opponents of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region.
According to the "Strategic Situation Awareness Platform of the South China Sea", a Chinese think tank, on January 9, a satellite found the US aircraft carrier "Carl Vinson" (USS Carl Vinson) near the Bababac Strait.
Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the West Pacific.
The platform predicts that the “Carl Vinson” will deploy in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the “Carl Vinson” aircraft carrier has carried the F-35C fighter aircraft and the CMV-22 “魚鷹” aircraft carrier transport aircraft for deployment.
The American warships that are currently sailing in the Pacific Ocean include the “Carl Vinson”, which departed from the United States on January 3.
The “Lincoln” also carried the F-35C fighter squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy is also deploying the "Ronald Reagan" aircraft carrier, which is docked in Sasebo, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the “Shandong Lake” missile cruiser and the “Stokdal” missile destroyer.
U.S. Three Aircraft Carriers Concentrate in the Region of China and Rare Visits to Guam in 2022 On January 17, 2022, the "Strategic Situation Awareness Platform of the South China Sea" released the latest satellite pictures, showing that three U.S. Aircraft Carriers were gathering in the region of China.
(Weibo @SouthChinaStrategicSituation Awareness) The US Navy’s three aircraft carriers gathered in the vicinity of China. The most powerful weapon seldom visited Guam on January 17, 2022.
(MicroBlog @South China Strategic Situation Awareness) According to a report by CNN on January 17, one of the strongest weapons in the US Navy’s arsenal visited Guam last weekend, which is a rare occurrence.
The nuclear submarine "Nevada", carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. Guam naval base on Saturday (January 15).
U.S. Three Aircraft Carriers Concentrate in the Region of China and the Visits of the Most Powerful Weapons to Guam, a Sign to Allies and Enemies in the Increasingly Tense Situation in the Indian-Pacific Region Analysts say.
This is the first visit of the ballistic missile submarine of the United States to Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
U.S. Three Aircraft Carriers Concentrate in the Region of China and Rare Visits to Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea in recent years.
The picture shows the Yongxue Island in the South China Sea.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio class nuclear submarine "Nevada" to Guam this time strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region and showed the United States' capabilities, flexibility and readiness for war. It also demonstrated the United States' commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
The ballistic missile submarine is usually called a "boomer submarine".
The whereabouts of 14 "Raygun Submarines" in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secret of the ballistic missile submarine has made the “Thunder Submarine” the most important survival weapon in the “three-in-one” nuclear weapon system, which also includes the launch ponds of ballistic missiles on the American mainland and B-2 and B-52 bombers that can carry nuclear warheads.
When asked about the recent drop of 26% in Meta's share price and the蒸发 of $25.10 billion in market capitalization, Zuckerberg responded that the company was "now facing unprecedented competition." Why?
Meta (originally Facebook) is essentially an advertising company. Its income is mainly from advertising. Today, a company that makes money is a company with its own traffic channel.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and so on, no matter what kind of function positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
In addition, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", and many apps are connected to Meta through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta is difficult to get the data and information of users, affecting the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is friendly to users, and will clearly indicate to users whether the App can access their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
If Google continues to stab, the income impact on Meta will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in the income growth of Meta has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Meta does not have any business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Meta's income of at least 10% comes from China every year, mainly from companies that do business in the sea.
Meta has about a hundred people in its office in Hong Kong and several major agents in the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas market, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel. The money they spend is mostly given to Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance is now one of Meta's main competitors, but in the past two years, Meta has made a lot of money from ByteDance.
All the agents in China are helping ByteDance to advertise on Meta. Meta's performance in China is also good.
I have not recently visited, but it must have been better than before.
The stage of massive spending by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Third, the new flow channel expansion is not successful.
Facebook is getting older and older, and new platforms such as TT are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only concerned with income, but more importantly, with what is expected in the future.
It is obvious that Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "original universe".
The Yuan cosmos is indeed one of the directions of the future, but the realization cycle of the Yuan cosmos is relatively long. This story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the next two or three years.
So in the next two years, Meta should be more difficult.
Although Facebook is very prosperous now, with annual revenues of US$100 billion to US$200 billion, it is in fact in a very critical situation. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, Facebook has no good and safe moat.
Although his several social software now have a high daily active user, they are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of TikTok's rapid development, Facebook also has little confidence, and the颠覆 is just a blink of an eye.
And the concept of the ultimate universe is beyond our reach, so there is no hope of success in a short time. Thus, Facebook is very dangerous. This is also the reason why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company again and again and looking for new routes. However, I think his route choice is wrong and a one-way street.
