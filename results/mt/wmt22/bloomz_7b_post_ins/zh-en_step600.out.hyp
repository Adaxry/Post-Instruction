Students take the lead at the Zhejiang University academic year conference, and the research results open people's minds - Xinhua Net
Wash your hands with air, blow your mouth to judge diseases, and search for the source of haze with precision Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Year of Zhejiang University, a series of groundbreaking academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. The research covers a wide range of fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, humanities and other fields. From a curious idea, the students have created a number of high-end inventions with application value. Some of these projects have won awards at home and abroad.
Biological sensor: Your family doctor
Zhang Di Ming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a bio-sensor on the mobile phone side that was half the size of the mobile phone.
You just need to exhale gently, and the instrument can preliminarily detect your health condition from the gas components you exhale. "
Zhang Di Ming said that this sensor is connected to the smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the smartphone after exhaling gas.
On the market, smart wristbands that can test the health condition generally test the temperature, pulse and other physical parameters.
This bio-sensor uses graphene, a new material. Its target is a chemical element. Its keen "smell" allows it to reflect the health condition more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgery light: Doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgery lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won the silver medal at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
The Master's students of the School of Optics and Engineering, Zhu Lin靖 and Sun Junfei, opened a new idea in the defects of traditional surgery lamps and invented an intelligent LED surgery lamp.
Many diseases cannot be detected and removed in the early stage, which is related to the light in the doctor's operating room.
Sheng Junfei said, for example, when early cancer detection, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancerous cells will spread later.
This intelligent surgical light has four lamp holders, through the adjustment of the spectrum, to enhance the difference between different tissues under the light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadow rate of the light spot according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical light has been tested at the Shao Yifu Hospital of the School of Medicine of Zhejiang University and the Children's Hospital of the School of Medicine of Zhejiang University, and received good feedback.
In October last year, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: save water and be cool
The common people wash their hands by water flushing, at most rubbing a little soap, squeezing a little hand sanitizer, while Li Qiang and his classmates invented an "air hand sanitizer".
As long as we stand on the toilet of the device, our weight can compress the air.
It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and mixes with water.
So we can wash our hands! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiment proved that the effect of hand washing through this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the cleaning degree, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely without energy consumption and energy conservation and environmental protection.
Last year, at the second Global Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many world-class universities and won the only gold award.

I #PRS_ORG# bought, but I wrote the wrong address
Can it be changed?
Or cancel the order
Okay, thanks
I feel that this certificate is very meaningful.
This is one of the important skills certificates I have besides my driving license!
普及一下：急救措施其实是应急救援，即在救护车到来之前的抢救。
It is well known that in the process of ambulance coming after the accident, there is actually still a period of time, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
At this time, it is necessary to provide emergency treatment.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage or sudden cardiac arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So people around me know how important CPR is!
When someone falls down around us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of standing there and doing nothing, which is too terrifying.
In China, there are about 3 million accidental deaths every year, and the most dangerous is sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, it is an average of 15%.
In the casinos and hotels in Las Vegas, 70% to 80% can be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are below 1%."
This is what Luo Le said, the founder of the first reaction.
If a person has a sudden cardiac arrest, breathing stops, heartbeat stops, and you pinch the person's nose is useless.
In order to save the person, it is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compression.
I find that now few people have this consciousness to learn emergency first aid, but it's too late when things happen, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can make timely responses to emergencies.
Maybe it can save someone's life!
Emergency certificates can be enrolled at your local Red Cross training center. I enrolled at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. Students also have a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to complete before I turn 25. I added the emergency permit to the list of goals a few months ago, but it has been completed!
Next, I will have to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I read on Little Red Book that there is a diving emergency certificate. I think I need an emergency certificate to take the diving emergency certificate. So the emergency certificate is still very useful!

First of all, I would like to say that I personally think that "Four Seas" is a full-range film.
But if you say that this movie is not a highlight, it is not at least the score is quite good.
There are many kinds of films that are so bad that they can make you fall asleep in the cinema, and there are many kinds of films that can make you furious after watching them. For the audience, the film is like a monkey on Mount Emei. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Kuan is truly exceptional.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it seems to be a creation of the K系 novel, which is difficult to describe, and has many holes like the windbreaker on the little horse.
Even after watching it, you will doubt whether there is a hidden metaphor in the director, but after careful thinking, you find it is actually a pile of shit.
First, I would like to say that I am very difficult to understand some scenes.
The main character lives on a small island in the south.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranged that one elderly man from the neighborhood drove a small面包 truck to take her to the northeast to see snow.
Senior citizens sitting in a truck from the south to the northeast to see snow?
He and his father are very confident about this.
Then the old man had no more words.
How does the main character's brother get the license to open a hotel on a derelict ship?
Why can the small gang of car thieves on the island easily seal a mountain road?
Then the truck carrying the rebar stopped at the side of the road, and there were no truck drivers around.
This is too obvious.
Why did a gangster with no credit and suspected of illegal activities become a constable?
Why not call the police in the face of high interest rates? In the movie, the police even asked if there was any difficulty.
An adult knows how to use an intelligent mobile phone, but does not know how to open the door of the hotel with the room card and then forcibly arrange the hotel boss to sleep outside the room?
The plot is so ridiculous that I feel pain when I remember it.
In addition to the plot, the worst is the theme of the film, that is, the film has no theme at all, just a hideous sewing monster.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to make a comedy film. After about 20 minutes, you will guess that it may be an inspirational film. After half an hour, you will think that it may be a drama film about the difficulty of surviving in the small town. After watching the film, you will have no idea what you have seen, and you will doubt yourself deeply. Why did he go to the cinema to enjoy his excrement on the big day of the year?
For most people, it is actually very familiar with the pattern of various films. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then you can inspire and comedy and then tell the audience about a talented rookie how to step by step towards success.
If you want to shoot a love film, then you have to tell the story of the enmity between the young town youth who loves riding motorcycles and the female server.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot should not contain anything that is at odds with the normal world.
(For example, the character played by Yin Zheng in the new motorcycle just burned, and then he can sing) cannot go to open some brain holes that Kennedy could not bear.
As for the main character, who is not mentally retarded, but acts like a five-year-old child in some aspects, I really don't know if it's the reason for acting or the director's requirements.
There is one thing I also don't understand. Why is Han Kuan so interested in adding a collision scene to his own movie?
Is it to make the audience angry?

Yi Xin inspection well brick machine equipment is widely used in new types of construction materials for municipal underground facilities such as coal, heat, water, electricity and gas.
For example: inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, sewage tanks and small buildings, bridges wing walls and so on.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the four sides of the module are all grooves, and the combination of the modules forms a chain lock.
The shear resistance of the wall is far better than that of the flat friction wall.
The module is a hollow structure. After combination, the longitudinal holes are connected, and the transverse holes are connected. After the core is poured, it forms a reticulated concrete structure. It has secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
There are grooves on both sides of the module, and the horizontal and vertical grooves correspondingly improve the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the use of concrete inspection well modules to build inspection wells and drainage wells is not easy to collapse, sink, leak and other phenomena. The wall module of the well is mechanically stable, easy to operate, and standard in shape.

Chongqing middle school piloted modern apprenticeship system - Xinhua Net
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year onwards, the city will pilot the “modern apprenticeship” talent training model in 60 middle vocational schools. The students accepted in the pilot training will simultaneously hold the apprentice identity. They will be pre-registered as unit employees by the pilot enterprises after enrollment.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the standardization of the admission and enrollment of middle vocational schools and the use of engineering procedures by enterprises, and clarifies the dual identity of middle vocational school students and enterprise qualified employees. According to the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who are 16 years old and under 18 years old, the apprentice, guardian, school and enterprise sign a four-party agreement to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content, rights and interests of the apprentice in the workplace.
Encouraged the pilot schools to adopt the modern apprenticeship form and cooperate with enterprises to jointly carry out pre-employment training and on-the-job training of enterprise employees.
The pilot schools should reform the mode of talent cultivation.
The school and enterprises jointly designed the talent training program, jointly formulated the professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise师傅 standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot is carried out as a pilot cycle, and the time of the students’ internship in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent cultivation program. The on-the-job internship is generally 6 months.
In the enterprise practice, the enterprise group management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, 1 master can teach 2 to 5 apprentices, and form a learning group to ensure that students master the skills required for each training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city will determine 60 pilot projects for the modern apprenticeship model of middle vocational education in three batches, each with about 50 people. A total of 3000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
According to the principle of first pilot and then implementation, from point to point to gradually promote, explore and establish a long-term mechanism for joint admission, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, and earnestly improve students' job skills, and improve students' employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Ominkeng has a strong contagion but most cases are mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Delta variant of the coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Omicron variant, although the latter is more contagious.
According to the Associated Press, as the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, more than 5,000 doctors in a township in South Africa reported that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they treated were relatively mild, such as body pain and coughing similar to those of the flu.
The director of the organization, Dr. Anben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but no patients need to be hospitalized.
Pelle said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation. "
He said that it included elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to fall into a critical condition due to the coronavirus infection.
He said that compared with the previous wave of the Delta epidemic, the new coronavirus patients he treated in the previous wave were "suffering from difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen level."
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days. "
In the two weeks after the first report of the mutation of the Omicron virus in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observation and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the summary of the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of the new coronavirus patients hospitalized in the past few weeks were seriously ill, which was half of the proportion of the first wave of the epidemic; the average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent new coronavirus patients died, while the death rate was 20% in the early outbreak of South Africa.
William Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, quoted the data of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports as follows: "At present, almost all the signs indicate that this is a milder disease. "
He also said: "Now is still early, we need to get late data.
Normally, the time of hospitalization and death is later, and we only entered this wave of epidemic for two weeks. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the main new coronavirus strain in the world, the Omicron case has appeared in dozens of countries, including South Africa, which is the epicenter of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases in豪登省 in the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests showed that the variant of Omikron accounted for more than 90%.
Thank you for today’s supporters, all 80 boxes were sent out!

Education Review: What is needed to rescue abducted children?
If compared with the famous public service advertisement, "No buy, no kill", in a good environment where there is no demand for "escorting", the prevention and control of the crime of "escorting" is not profitable, the risk is high, and the cost is high. Such crimes will not occur frequently.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security developed an emergency information release platform for missing children.
This is an Internet information platform established to establish an authority channel for the publication of information on missing children and to find missing children in a timely manner.
I heard that the name of this App is "Union", and I felt warm.
New technologies not only have the name of "art" and the feeling of fullness, but also are applied appropriately and are practical and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement against child trafficking is to find the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Next is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment can be listed in many "large words" such as individual punishment, social prevention and legal education.
However, before the case is solved, it is necessary to pay more attention to the safety of the victim.
It is necessary to distinguish between different topics according to their urgency and importance. Such controversial topics as “Is it necessary to impose the death penalty on the sale of children?” can be put on hold and carefully discussed, but the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
According to the experience of the investigation of such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to getting away from the crime scene as soon as possible after the crime.
If the investigation is delayed for one minute, the child will be further away from the parent, and the difficulty of the case will increase by one.
In this case, it is a pragmatic move to take measures such as the "Union" platform, which directly helps solve cases and find children.
In the end, it is a big task to “fight against child trafficking”.
In order to combat crime, safeguard the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary, and the careful enforcement of law, it is necessary to implement the care for the weak and young.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can also be better from the family to the society.
For example, a common case is that a family of three is resting at the station, and the parents are sleeping. When they wake up, they find that their child has disappeared.
It is not possible to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, it is at least necessary to have a certain level of protection awareness.
It is the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police's fight against the crime of kidnapping, the buyer of the abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
The single illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of China's Criminal Law, the minimum punishment for the crime of kidnapping children is 5 years. In cases of particularly serious circumstances, the minimum punishment may reach the death penalty and the confiscation of property.
The starting point is high and the maximum punishment is heavy. In the light of the trend of "light punishment", the crime of trafficking in children is obviously a more serious crime.
There are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward ideas about raising children, and their legal awareness is poor.
The legal education of this part of the people should be synchronized with it.
In order to effectively control the crime of trafficking in persons, it is not enough to rely only on strict law enforcement by the authorities.
If the "market" for kidnapping is widespread, the kidnappers are greedy and constantly innovate kidnapping methods, forming a "duel" situation with law enforcement officers, and the anti-kidnapping operation will inevitably fall into a low efficiency muddle.
Therefore, breaking the concept of backwardness, popularizing legal knowledge, and also helping to eradicate the crime of kidnapping and buying children.
Yang Hodong delivered a speech on the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the provincial party conference at Ma栏shan
From the history of the 100-year struggle of the Party
On the morning of October 12, according to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, Yang Hodong, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of Propaganda of the Provincial Party Committee, made an interactive lecture at the Video and Creative Park of Ma Lan Shan in the morning of October 12. He studied and implemented the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, studied and implemented the spirit of the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping to Hunan Province, and studied and implemented the spirit of the 12th Party Congress of the province.
Yang Hodong explained the essence and requirements of the spirit of the meeting from three aspects of ideal belief and original mission, self-improvement and youthful party, party leader and party theory.

The International Olive Oil Council divides olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil and lampante olive oil or refined olive oil.
The first-press olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is obtained from fresh olive fruit by mechanical cold pressing and other treatments to remove impurities.
According to the different acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: The highest grade and quality of olive oil. It is a natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity is not more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil (FVOO): The acidity is slightly higher, but not more than 2%, and the taste is pure and fragrant.
Ordinary virgin olive oil (Ordinary Virgin): The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity is not more than 3.3%.
The refined olive oil refers to the olive oil refined after the acidity exceeds 3.3%, or the “second oil”.
The refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Regular olive oil (Olive Oil): The refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to adjust the taste and color. Its acidity is less than 1.5% and transparent golden yellow.
Refined olive pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): Olive oil extracted from the pomace and refined.
You should have noticed by now that the acidity of olive oil is an important indicator.
It should be noted that the olive fruit is like the grape used to make wine. Olive fruit from different regions and different olive fruit varieties will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place for olive tree growth:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for the growth of olive trees.
In addition to the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only plant sparsely in the suitable area.
Main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, as well as those with similar climates such as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and so on, are far away from the equator.
The harvesting month of olive:
From March to June every year, it is the flowering and fruiting time of olive trees. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature. The fruit changes from green to red, purple and finally black.
The harvest season is from November to February next year (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
The nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil contains rich monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition so far.
At the end of the summit, Biden said that the flame of freedom will never be extinguished
The online "Democracy Summit" (Summit for Democracy) convened by US President Joe Biden and attended by leaders of governments and civil society and private sectors from 110 countries ended on Friday (October 12).
In his closing speech, Biden said that the flame of freedom was burning in the hearts of all people in the world, and the authoritarian regime could never extinguish it.
He also said that the plan is to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwanese government representatives and Taiwan Affairs Councilors Tang Feng and currently exiled British Hong Kong democracy and human rights activists Law Chi-kwong also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the job is before us.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge because I have said before, as this summit shows, the democratic world is everywhere.
The authoritarian regime can never extinguish the flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said: "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the protective wall of democracy, promote reform and achieve transparent accountability governance, so that we can better resist the buffer and impact of authoritarianism and those who want to pursue power nakedly in the public interest. "
The theme of the second day of the "Democratic Summit" was to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and fight authoritarianism, and to counter digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values.
This day coincides with the "International Human Rights Day".
In his opening speech on the same day, United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially the challenges brought about by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reiterate common values and positions and the resilience of democracy.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, updating the social contract, investing in high-quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Law Chi-kwong delivered a speech at the summit via pre-recorded video, reminding the participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and the minorities such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans in China.
He said: "Over the long term, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Luo Guanzhong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you haven't realized that (the Communist Party of China) poses a threat to our democratic values.
This is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason we must change. "
In the round-table discussion on “fighting against digital authoritarianism and affirming the value of democracy”, Taiwan Executive Yuan Secretary of State Tang Feng issued the “State Declaration” through video, stressing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and totalitarianism.
He also shared how to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "In the early days of Taiwan's democracy, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, the authoritarian governments around the world justified the violations of human rights on the pretext of public health and collective interests, and the global democracy showed signs of backwardness.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to close the city to control the epidemic, and we do not have to withdraw to defeat fake information. "
At the same time as the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the U.S. Treasury announced the imposition of sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea and other countries that were found to have committed serious human rights violations, as well as investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the restaurant's spiked chicken is alive
I want to try tennis, but I am afraid that I will not stick to it. So I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the level of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, then the normal price is more friendly than the cheap one, such "entry level" is actually industrial garbage.
Their strength is low, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large. The hard ball cannot withstand. It is difficult for high-ranking players to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult that you know you won't learn, and you know you won't be able to afford the expensive one, so you get a cheap one to fool you. You won't play twice, so the racket will be cheap and you won't mind.
When you can really distinguish good from bad, it means that you have made progress, and come to me here to buy expensive, I will make twice the money.
It is recommended to buy a second-hand good one for a similar price. Choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so the good ones are not worth the price. A new one costs around 500 or 600. A second-hand one costs around 200. Isn’t it worth having a 1000-yuan one?
It is friendly to beginners, but it is useless after the beginner stage. However, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the beginner stage.
The delivery time has been repeatedly delayed
Can you help follow up?

In fact, there are many considerations for the clothing of a girl with a slender body.
Girls with a fat body should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length should be around the knee, just covering the fat part of the thigh.
If the skirt is too short, it will show the fat on the legs.
If it is too long, it will give the impression of being short and fat.
If it is divided into three sections, it will show that you naturally increase height, that is, the upper body, skirt and long socks with different colors will produce a slender feeling.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard equipment of slender girls (which the author has a deep understanding of). Dark colors are also a good way to cover up your body fat. Sophisticated black skirts are also the first choice of slender girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially black skirts, will make you feel slimmer.
If your legs are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too much attention.
The more popular the better, and the color should not be too bright.
In order to prevent people from getting fat when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
For girls who are slightly overweight, it is necessary to talk about how to dress well.
The girl who is slightly overweight should not wear tight skirts. The top should not be too short or put into the skirt. It will be very uncomfortable for people to look at. If your legs are thick, you should wear black long socks or net socks (the kind with fine mesh). Choose a print喇叭 skirt with soft texture. Pair it with a V-neck top. It will be able to hide the shortcomings of the girl who is slightly overweight.
Of course, there are some rules for slender girls when they wear skirts.
If a fat girl wears a skirt, she should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt. This will make her fat body appear taller.
Short skirts paired with heels can make your legs look longer, which is the most fashionable combination in the summer!
If you are fat in the upper body but thin in the legs, you can choose a glamorous skirt.
It can not only cover the belly, but also show your advantages.
The A-line skirt will make you look slimmer. It is more suitable for fat girls. The top should be selected to be tighter. It will help you look slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt with a skirt is suitable for a fat girl.
The girl who is slightly overweight can also wear fashion.
As long as you can master the rules of clothing combination, then fat girls will also be the focus of attention.
After changing the way of dressing, it is necessary to exercise more in daily life so as to break free from the label of being overweight.

Girls donate money for their sister as a target : "I just don't want to think about it being a flesh wound," - Xinhua
In the square of Wulin in Hangzhou, a girl stood in front of a large wooden board, on which was written the words "Man's flesh target, 10 yuan per arrow".
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl willing to be a 'arrow target' to raise money for her sister" was刷爆朋友圈.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board at the Wulin Square in Hangzhou, on which the words "people's flesh target, 10 yuan per arrow" are written, indicating that the passerby can use the bow and arrow to shoot after paying the money.
The behavior triggered heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity director of the South District Public Security Bureau of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl had such an extreme action because she had raised money for her sister. However, such a behavior is not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl on the street "arrow target" donation warning
The photo circulating on the Internet shows a girl with long hair standing in front of a large wooden board, on which is written in black ink the words "man meat target, 10 yuan per arrow". Another wooden board in front of her shows her bank account and WeChat, Alipay account, etc.
The picture caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believed that this was a "poor beggar behavior", while many netizens expressed sympathy.
We found the situation when we patrolled to the square around 10 o'clock on the morning of the 23rd. At that time, there were many spectators around.
When interviewed by local media near the scene of the incident, the police officers at the Tianshui police station said that there were two girls on the street, both around 20 years old, and they were all in good looks.
Among them, the girl who acted as a "body target" was crying and begging passers-by to play the game; another girl was helping to yell, saying that her sister had acute leukemia and now needed surgery fee, so please help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting donations for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, a spokesperson for the Yue District Public Security Bureau of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Jijia Li, who raised funds for her sister Jijia Yan.
However, due to the fact that the treatment still needs more than 30,000 costs at one time, it is not easy to find a good way to raise funds, so it has made such a behavior.
He said that during the whole process, the two girls were a target and a helper, but they did not participate in it. No one shot arrows during the whole process, but people watched and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After the police were examined by the public security department, the arrows used by the police were not within the scope of control.
The person in charge said, "It is not recommended to adopt this eye-catching fundraising method."
After being warned by the police station, she has left the police station.

What is the most popular in 2021?
Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, there was a very popular article called "Quick Look! Olympic Project Managers Can Strike Gold", in which it was mentioned that project managers can always take the lead in many projects, no one can match them: Moving bricks, traveling, staying up late is the daily routine of project managers. Saving fires, bearing the blame, and apologizing are also not difficult.
The article seems to be a joke, but it also reveals the daily hardship of project managers. It represents the inability of current project management work.
Those who work in project management also gradually choose some actions to get rid of the difficulties in their work.
According to the number of people applying for the PMP (International Certified Project Management Professional) every year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "China Project Management Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of people applying for the PMP® was nearly 600,000, the number of people passing the PMP® certification was about 420,000, and the number of people with valid certificates was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificates in the world.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year. This shows that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer possible to do things by simply copying the "old experience" of the past. The fast-changing working environment tells us that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of giants to explore the way forward.
However, does passing the PMP guarantee smooth project management?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the relevant knowledge points of the ten fields and five process groups of project management, but when it comes to actual project management, they are still in the dark.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: Project management cognition is not enough, relying only on personal experience, only has project management theory, but does not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process and system support, cannot be implemented in the work, project estimation is not accurate, the controllability is poor, the project is delayed again and again; members are not clearly assigned, and the "old fish" in the team does not know how to deal with the project; cross department communication is not smooth, the project cannot be advanced...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than 10 years, it has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other R&D key personnel, and has won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting came with the online course of "Research and Development Project Manager Special Training Camp".
The online course of "Research and Development Project Manager Training Camp" This is an online fragmented learning method combining many practical cases and tools of research and development enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard movements of project managers and take the next step in your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less investment to promote the cultivation process of project managers and bring efficient operation results to enterprises.
It is not possible to judge a book by its cover, so it is necessary to see what other students think about this course: This course is not only a professional explanation of the course content based on the international advanced project management method and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises by the expert team of Zhongtian-Huaxia (formerly the Huawei R&D Management Team), but also a combination of the international advanced project management method and the real business scenario of many well-known enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich templates and forms, helping students to transform the learning content into specific work after class.

On the eve of the “Double Twelfth”, Jiaxin urged consumers to make rational consumption - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website
This year's "Eleventh Day of the Eleventh Month" national online payment business transaction amount reached 177 billion yuan, a new high compared with previous years.
The variety of promotional coupons and the eye-catching live shopping have once again made consumers exclaim the benefits. This consumer boom has not only made people wonder about the increasingly strong national consumer power, but also forced them to cool down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer group.
On the eve of the “Double 12”, JX Finance Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “JX Finance”) issued a call for rational consumption, reminding all users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption consciousness and consumption habits, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
On the whole, the performance of Chinese residents in the field of financial consumption is better, but there are large differences in the field of financial behavior and skills. It is still necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy of the elderly and the young is relatively low. The focus of financial education for the elderly and the young will still be “one old and one young”. The “China Youth Debt Report” released by Nielsen and the “2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report” released by CCTV Finance showed that the young generation has great potential for consumption. Credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products. Nearly half of young people have no debt accumulation. Although the young generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, it is diametrically opposed to the label of “over-spending” attached to the outside world. However, some young people do exist in excessive consumption, following the trend of consumption, and thus have a large financial pressure and debt risk, even leading to social problems gradually increasing. Financial enterprises should be courageous to shoulder social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, JX Finance has been committed to helping the common people build their own happy life with high-quality and personalized services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption view, and actively responding to the call of supervision, so as to enhance the rational consumption consciousness of consumers, especially young people.
In the past few years, JX Finance has carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and has helped young people establish rational consumption concepts, reasonably plan their consumption needs, and then help them accumulate life wealth.
At the arrival of the Double 12, JX Credit reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and a correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumption lending misunderstandings, and avoid affecting personal credit and future economic life.
It is necessary to plan ahead and pay on time.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the future purchase of cars and real estate.
At the same time, while enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking the qualifications of relevant institutions.
In the future, with its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated financial products, JX Finance will continue to bring more tailored services to consumers, help the masses improve their financial literacy, help consumers develop the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and become a lifelong consumer finance partner for consumers.

Vietnamese People's Daily Network - Gulf Cooperation Council should face common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit of Mohammed bin Salman to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in 2017, causing the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations while having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tension seriously affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January 2021, and the Gulf countries signed an agreement to move towards "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened the border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are trying to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors to Qatar by the two countries.
The Gulf Arab states resolved their differences to restore their relations with Qatar out of the need to unite for the interests of all countries and the stability of the region.
During the visit of Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of the two countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest 5 billion dollars in Oman, and the two countries signed 13 cooperation memoranda worth 3 billion dollars.
The visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to the Gulf countries coincided with the negotiations between Iran and the world’s major countries on the Iranian nuclear agreement - the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which the Gulf countries condemned because they believed that it could not solve the Iranian missile issue.
All Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a "competitor" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
All Gulf countries believe that it is defective not to solve the Iranian missile problem and not to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
In the context of failed negotiations between major powers and Iran on nuclear issues, Saudi Arabia and Iran have conducted direct negotiations.
Its goal is to prevent the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that can slow down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first Gulf Cooperation Council summit since the dispute between some members and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the contribution of diplomacy to promoting the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and put forward measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of Gulf countries.

It is said that the exhaust sound of the super car in the new area is the largest!
This time, our team brought this car to everyone.
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor of Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The price is close to two million Malaysian ringgit. The annual road tax is Malaysian ringgit. Why is it called LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Well, I don't know, the data says that acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h takes only 2.9 seconds, which is about the time it takes for my car to reach 30 km/h.
The low, spiky body, the boar's-tongue doors, the huge air intake all over the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine under the clear glass, perfectly embodied the style of Lamborghini.
For the description of the vehicle, it is not necessary to say much. You can Google it yourself. Here are some explanations that Google may not provide!
It was too much attention, and everywhere I went, everyone was looking at me, which was very uncomfortable!
The cost of gasoline at 1 km is around RM1 (the owner does not care)
You should practice getting on and off the bus, otherwise it will be a little embarrassing (because you will climb out of the bus and get stuck in the middle)
The engine sound was too loud, and I suddenly became deaf after getting off the car. (But it was still very enjoyable)
The car body is too large, and it will be narrow when it is parked in a normal parking space. I am afraid that it will be hit by the door of the car next to it!
I am a little lonely because there is no opponent on the road (I myself said, not related to the owner, hahaha)
Don't misunderstand, this video's supercar is not for sale, sorry!
If you want to take a video of your car, please contact us!
More information about cars you don't know is at The Car Guide / People's Car Guide
The accident involved a car worth millions!
The Bugatti Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, while the Porsche 911 is also a million-dollar car!
Just a few days ago, millions of supercars such as 911 and Chiron were knocked down by foreign cars in a matter of minutes!
The result is reasonable!
Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua
The spirit of a university refers to a series of educational concepts and values that a university has accumulated over time in its development process. It is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university is crucial for the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, the university has been entrusted with a unique mission different from other social organizations. For my country's universities, it was born in the autumn of national danger, and its spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocated the value concept of "mindfulness for the world" and the patriotic responsibility of "strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is increasingly obvious. The global education competition, scientific and technological competition and talent competition are constantly intensifying. As an important "supply side", the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the introduction of the "General Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and World-Class Disciplines" has not only shown the confidence and determination of China to move from a large country in higher education to a strong country in higher education, but also put forward higher and higher requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to enter the world’s top 100 within a short period of time and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having a certain gap, so as to achieve “overstepping the curve”?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the advantage of being late, by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents from overseas, learning from the advanced experiences of world-class universities, and achieving a significant improvement in academic level and teaching quality; second, the advantage of culture, inheriting the wisdom内涵 accumulated in five thousand years of Chinese civilization, and promoting the development of excellent traditional cultures, so as to gather strength, shape brands, and improve the image; third, the advantage of the system, giving full play to the superiority of the system of a socialist country, strengthening the goal drive, aggregating the consensus force, optimizing the allocation of resources, and providing a sustainable solid guarantee for the school to catch up with the world’s advanced level.
It is particularly necessary to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university in the same way, and that every school must show its personality and characteristics while playing its role.
The characteristics of the school should have both common Chinese characteristics and unique goals, traditions and resources.
As for Zhejiang University, we attach importance to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in our education: one is to highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent training, build an integrated educational environment of scientific research and industry, and form a complete chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; the other is to highlight the characteristics of cross-disciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, create a system environment of cross-disciplinary convergence, actively cultivate emerging cross-disciplinary disciplines and landmark cross-disciplinary results; the third is to highlight the characteristics of the education system and social service, carry out in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a system of cooperation between universities and enterprises in Zhejiang University.
In the process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university resonates with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of “Seeking Truth and Innovation”, the common value of “Diligent Study, Improving Virtue, Distinguishing Truth from Falsehood, and Being Dedicated to Practice”, and the common value of “Harmonizing Rivers and Mountains, Opening up Truth and Deeds, Opening up Things for the People, and Establishing Our Nation” have jointly formed the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of education and continuously accumulate cultural height and凝聚 spiritual strength. It has rich connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, " <v>Hina Jianghe</v> " emphasizes openness and inclusiveness, reflects the spirit of "using all the talents in the world", and manifests itself in absorbing the excellent ideas of the world’s top universities in running schools and educating people; "启真厚德" emphasizes the pursuit of truth to the best of its ability, which means that when a university pursues truth, it should also accept the cultivation of virtue and the refinement of personality; "开物前民" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of new knowledge, scientific research innovation, as well as reform and development, reform and renewal; "树我邦国" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that a university should always be with the national destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
"Smart people listen to the silent, and bright people see the invisible."
It is necessary for Chinese colleges and universities to further grasp the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply understand the position of higher education in the current era and the historical mission it should shoulder, and accelerate the construction of becoming a world-class university.
At the same time, it is necessary to adhere to humanistic care and independent freedom, so that the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the national spirit can mutually stimulate each other, thus providing endless impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation and the realization of the common ideal of humanity.

At the time of NFT's rapid rise, the crypto community has emerged with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in the Asian region, and residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic began to earn stable income in this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet breeding game based on blockchain technology, which combines NFT and other methods. It is currently the highest NFT project in terms of transaction volume, with more than $3 billion.
According to data from TokenTerminal, Axie Infinity's daily income exceeded US $8.2 million, close to the "Kingdom of Glory".
On August 6 this year, the official Axie Infinity announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" has transmitted a new "palytoearn" mode to more people. Players are no longer single characters. In addition to enjoying the game and making economic benefits, players can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game production company, but by the blockchain technology.
When I saw a news about the stock price of my friend, my biggest feeling was that enterprises should choose the right industry in the race. That is to say, enterprises should choose the right industry for investment. First, enterprises should choose the industry with a large growth space. At least, the industry should have a market size of more than 10 billion. Second, enterprises should choose the industry with a good future growth. Consider the industry with the best future growth in the next three to five years. Finally, enterprises should choose the industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and the flatness or ruggedness of the track refers to the competition pattern of the industry.
To the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to sum up 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
The tactic is "do the things right", which means to do things correctly.
The strategy is to "do the right thing", which is to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find the direction, and the tactics are to land. Above most tactics, there is strategic thinking space.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking); how to deepen the current field (strategic thinking); how to expand the field horizontally (strategic thinking); how to improve the retention rate of customers (tactical thinking); how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); how to set up the correct KPI for activities (tactical thinking); how to achieve the correct activity goal (strategic thinking); how to improve the participation rate of target customers (tactical thinking); how to activate high-value silent customers (strategic thinking); how to attract new customers precisely (strategic thinking); how to improve the DAU (tactical thinking); and whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Since its birth 12 years ago, Bitcoin has witnessed several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the Central American country of El Salvador designated Bitcoin as a legal currency, making Bitcoin the first legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of the Bitcoin ETF by ProShares and its listing on the New York Stock Exchange for the first time in eight years, marking the arrival of the first Bitcoin futures ETF on the US capital market and the expansion of the cryptocurrency investment opening.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Thank you to the photographer and makeup artist, who made me have a unique wedding photo.
Thank you all the staff who took the wedding photo today. I am looking forward to the finished film.
It is a physical job to take a wedding photo, especially for the photographer, who has to run and jump.
The make-up artist designed a make-up style suitable for my face shape, and the photographer was very humorous and deserved a positive review.
Thanks to my photographers and make-up artists, I can still see how beautiful I can be in my lifetime.
He praised her eyes, which were beautiful, and her good looks, saying that she would be a good wife and mother.

The most important thing when taking a wedding photo is that the photographer and the make-up artist are in line with the aesthetic. Fortunately, I met them.
After seeing my wedding photo, I found out that I was also a "photoshop".
Americans of Asian descent complain of discrimination at Yale and other three Ivy League universities - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (reporter Xu Jianmei) On the 23rd, more than 130 Asian American groups submitted an appeal to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice, protesting that three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College - discriminated against Asian American applicants during the admissions process.
The Asian Education Alliance, which initiated the appeal, held a press conference in Washington that day.
Chairman Zhao Yuxiang of the group said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the conditions for admission to US top universities has been doubled, but in these three US top universities, the proportion of Asians has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities discriminate against Asian American students "long-term and systematically" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" of admissions.
According to Zhao Yu空, the research of Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that in these three universities, the relative number of applicants, Asians have the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups.
The data from the U.S. Department of Education also showed that among all Ivy League universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest proportion of Asian students admitted, while Yale University and Brown University had implemented racial quotas for Asian students for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yu空 told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they expect the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice to conduct an investigation after filing the appeal and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from discriminating against Asian students in the admissions.
They also expect colleges and universities to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies for Asians.
At present, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it complained of Harvard University's discrimination in admissions, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to the American Chinese group, the American Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani educational groups also participated in the appeal.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a real estate broker that there was a factory in Zhaotong Town, Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province. After several visits to the site, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Mr. Lin, the family member of the owner of the building, on the details of the purchase of the building, and transferred 20,000 yuan as a deposit through the bank on the same day.
Lin signed on behalf of the receiver in the "Deposit Receipt for the Purchase of Factory Buildings", which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy this factory building, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory building, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. The two parties agreed to sign the contract for the purchase and sale of factory buildings within one week."
However, the two sides could not reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, which resulted in the failure to sign the house purchase contract.
Considering that the two sides could not reach an agreement on the content of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned 20,000 yuan of deposit to Mr. Lu.
After a long search, Mr. Lu finally found a house that he liked. He paid a deposit and was ready to sign the contract. However, the seller refused to sell the house. This made Mr. Lu frustrated and angry.
Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After the trial, the court found that the two parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, which cannot be solely attributed to the defendant. It is reasonable to assume that the negotiation was unsuccessful, so the case should not apply the penalty of double repayment of the deposit. The defendant does not need to bear the default liability of double repayment of the deposit.
After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the second court maintained the original verdict.
Lawyers remind: In the course of the transaction, it is necessary to exercise due diligence.
At the time of signing the contract, as a buyer, you should exercise the necessary due diligence, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, etc., and clearly stipulating the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
(Voice of Germany) After the "leadership summit for democracy" ended on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement on Saturday (November 11) that the US held the "leadership summit for democracy" was "dividing the world into ideological camps, weaponizing democracy, pretending to be democracy to carry out anti-real democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and shifting domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value system on others, carried out 'democratic reconstruction', abused unilateral sanctions, instigated 'color revolutions', and caused catastrophic consequences.
‘Democracy’ has long been a ‘massive’ weapon used by the US to interfere in other countries.
This summit is a move by Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was held via video, and the leaders of 111 countries were invited to participate, including the leaders of Taiwan. However, China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There were also voices of doubt internationally and domestically in the US, such as the criticism that some leaders invited to the summit had authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and that the real intention of the Biden administration was not to promote democracy but to achieve geopolitical goals.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also participated in the video democracy summit
The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on Saturday said, "Today's American democracy is pathological, and the problems of money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social division, racial contradictions, and income and wealth disparities are getting worse and worse." The American democracy is based on capitalism. "
In his speech, US President Joe Biden said, "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reform and achieve transparent accountability governance, so that we can better resist the缓冲 and impact of authoritarianism and those who want to pursue power nakedly in the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not a matter of course, "we must constantly update it in every generation, to me, this is the decisive challenge of our time. "
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "face persistent and worrying challenges."
The US side has promised to launch a one-year action after this democratic summit, including a $4.244 billion initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The US hopes that all countries will make concrete public commitments before the 2022實體民主峰會, so as to improve their democratic system.
Biden said, "Let us all implement our commitments and report our progress next year."

Education Thinking: How University Exams Differentiate “Top Students” and “Bottom Students”- Xinhua Net
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote letters to the school leaders, expressing their confusion about the university examination, and proposing to increase the difficulty of the examination, change the examination form, and make the examination truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, for a long time, university examinations have been a "hot topic".
In the campus of the university, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and levels, and different levels of study.
For a group with such a diversified feature, it is inevitable to have different feelings.
Of course, if the test questions are simple and repetitive, the questions are too easy, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who are not hardworking may pass the exam by concentrating on the exam before the exam. If they want to do other things, they may achieve better results.
As a result, there is a "poor student" who passes the exam even though he does not put in much effort; and a "studious student" who does not miss any class, has good homework and notes, and is not much higher in the exam.
It seems that the students at the Langfang University of Science and Technology reflect the problems in the university examination, and believe that this situation does not only exist at the Langfang University of Science and Technology.
In this sense, I would like to applaud the three students who wrote directly.
In fact, people who have gone to college know that it is not uncommon for students to make up their minds to study hard and “borrow” exam questions from teachers in order to get a good grade, and even for students to take notes during the exam and ask teachers for mercy after the exam.
In my view, as a measure of the quality of teaching, judging whether a university's examination is qualified is more about the comprehensive grasp of teachers on teaching and learning, and the scientific formulation based on this foundation.
At the undergraduate stage of the university, the discipline begins to be subdivided, and many professional courses are dominated by basic knowledge.
Unquestionably, whether you fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a discipline is the content to be tested in university examinations.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic knowledge of the discipline. From the perspective of knowledge points, there is little change, and the basic is fixed.
As a teacher said, "I learned the basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago, and I still learn it now, and it is still the focus. "
But the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test is simple and repetitive.
In many universities, exams are generally formed into a group of questions, and then the senior teachers of the subject coordinate the composition of the exam, and the grading of the exam is also carried out by all teachers who are responsible for the subject. This can partially overcome the repetition of the question.
But to prepare a set of tests that conforms to the reality of teaching and learning, the difficulty of the questions is normally distributed according to the overall situation of student learning, and it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the level of student learning, so as to have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty of the questions and the types of questions, so as to not only highlight the examination of basic knowledge, but also pay attention to the examination of ability, and at the same time, innovate the types of questions.
The examination is the conductor of university education. What kind of examination there is, there will be a corresponding preparation plan for students. Over time, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the advice letter of the student, and has already deployed a plan for rectification across the school.
It requires all teaching units to organize teachers to carry out discussion and compare the final exam, formulate the exam question and related system, and at the same time, strengthen the supervision and inspection of the exam question and review process, and improve the comprehensive evaluation of the course.
From the perspective of mechanism, it is an issue that colleges and universities need to face that the types of questions are single and the questions are repeated. Of course, it is necessary to put forward corresponding systems. However, it is more important to practice in daily life. Teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of teaching conditions. They should not only master the teaching content, but also the learning conditions of students. They should master both sides, so that the teaching and learning will be better matched, and a benign interaction will be formed. The examination will be more in line with reality, so that the “top students” and “bottom students” will get what they deserve.

Kim夫人婚纱摄影（南街店）暂时还没有分店
Before taking the photo, we changed the time twice because our time was not arranged. The consultant Lan Lan was very patient to help us arrange the time.
I later chose a good weekend to take photos.
The staff of Mrs Kim are all super.
That was the first time I had ever been professionally made up and wow, I never thought I would look so good one day, hahaha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry, I forget the name) are very patient in makeup and makeup.
The scene was filmed in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, so I did not feel very cold. When we were taking photos, the make-up artist occasionally paid attention to our clothes, headgear, and immediately helped us adjust.
The photographer was very humorous and felt very happy after taking pictures all day.
When choosing photos, because I saw many cases on the Internet, I did not want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we chose photos, we really did not want to add photos at all, just the 24 photos in the package (I heard that my cousin who took her wedding photos at the same time as me added more than 10,000 photos to her 7,000-yuan package. I was shocked and also afraid that I would choose too many photos)
Today, the photo was fixed, and Lan Lan sent it to me. I saw two photos that were not good, and they immediately helped me to fix them.
Comparing the photos of my sister before, I think our photos are really satisfied. Simple and fresh, just what I want.
I sincerely recommend that you go to Xuanhan Golden Lady to take wedding photos!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Thank you for wishing me happiness and prosperity.

Saba 3200 new babies without birth certificates due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeit paper
The Sarawak National Registration Bureau said that due to the exhaustion of the special anti-counterfeit paper stock, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October, with a total of 3200 affected people.
However, the Director of the Bureau, Kerouamis, assured that all babies who had applied for the birth certificate had their data recorded in the system. When the counterfeit paper arrived next week, it would be issued again.
At the press conference, he made an explanation about the long-lasting report on the printing issue of the newspaper by a web media for more than 10 months.
He said that the problem had appeared two months ago and Sarawak also faced the same problem.
One reason is that the Chinese manufacturer of special anti-counterfeit paper has been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed delivery to China.
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used by Sabah Post was different from that of other regions, so it could not be borrowed from other states.
Kailuanus revealed that the latest batch of counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on June 6, and was handed over to the printing company for partial printing on August 8.
The agency will send people to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and return to Sabah immediately for the final stage of printing, which is estimated to take 2 working days (December 20).
We will notify the applicant to go to the local branch to receive the newspaper.
He added that Sarawak has issued a total of 248,101 newspapers so far this year.

The Winter Olympics in Sarajevo in 1984 were successfully held here. Two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open. It will present a simple, safe and wonderful event to the world.
It is expected that the two countries will deepen exchanges and cooperation in the preparation of winter sports events and the training of athletes, and the Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play a bridging role. With the Beijing Winter Olympic Games as an opportunity, it will promote the deepening of humanistic exchanges between the two countries, so that the two peoples "go forward together" and wish the Bosnian athletes good results in Beijing.
Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the 10th Annual Best Athlete Award Ceremony. Qi Ping was invited as a special guest to award the best young athletes in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The video of Beijing Winter Olympic Games was played on the spot.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a notice requiring to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic at the port city - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporter Dong Ruifeng and Guo Tiancheng) The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic at the port city, requiring people who have recently left the port city on land borders (excluding Hong Kong and Macao with ports) to have a negative nucleic acid test within 48 hours. People going to the port city on land borders must have at least one nucleic acid test after their arrival.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining the scope of ports cities in each province and city and announcing it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that the port city with conditions may study setting up a buffer zone for epidemic prevention within its jurisdiction.
According to the person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area. The two sides have frequent exchanges of border residents.
The policy of differentiated management is implemented, and the prevention and control of the spread of the epidemic is transformed from one line of defense to two lines of defense. It is expected to realize the forward movement of the epidemic control, reduce the risk of the spread of the epidemic, and achieve the greatest effect of epidemic prevention and control with the smallest social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local cluster outbreaks in China, all of which are imported from abroad through ports.
The above notice points out that this exposes some problems such as late epidemic monitoring and early warning, unfulfilled closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, formal periodic nucleic acid detection, unfulfilled disinfection of all links of cold chain items, unregulated management of centralized isolation places, insufficient scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that it should focus on nine aspects such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of the port city, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, so as to speed up the filling of the shortfalls and weaknesses in the epidemic prevention and control of the port city, and do a good job in preventing and controlling the epidemic scientifically and precisely, and weave a solid external prevention and control line.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should synchronously study and deploy the work of prevention and control of the epidemic and民生保障, publish and open the hotline for民生保障, regularly check the苗头隐患 of basic living supplies and prices, and solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reported by the masses.
According to the notice, the ports referred to in the notice include open land, water and air ports in the county (city, district and flag), the city (city, state and league) and the capital city (province, autonomous region), which are determined and announced by the province (autonomous region) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

Oil tube video reveals the truth of US 20 years of bloodshed - Xinhua
(Video source: YouTube)
On November 11, a micro-documentary called "Mastermind" on the oil platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the Afghanistan war under the guise of “counter-terrorism”, forcing the export of American democracy through war, 20 years of bloodshed, bloodthirstiness and indiscriminate killing of innocent people, committing all kinds of human rights violations.
The use of unmanned aerial vehicles to bomb hospitals, schools and other civilian places has distorted human nature and formed a killing team.
Over the past 20 years, the US has killed thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up a "black prison" to inflict various forms of torture and humiliation on "criminals".
Human rights violations have triggered more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorist" war is "anti-terrorist".
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Watch the video and let's uncover the truth behind the US's bloodthirsty killings under the guise of "anti-terrorism" and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I accidentally saw the following article, from the perspective of business and the perspective of the preservation period, why this customer wants the logistics company in the customs area to help do the canning. Although the canning is a deep processing, it does not belong to the business scope of the customs logistics company. Here is the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I have visited many奶粉 manufacturers and touched many production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the powder in the bag and the container are the same, and there is no difference.
So everyone will ask: Why is the shelf life of the bagged product one year, while the shelf life of the container is two years or longer?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between the container and the bag so large?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, believe that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the more expensive the better.
Some consumers also said that the taste or smell of the canned food was different!
Now I will tell you about the reason for the high price of bottled water and where it is.
Why is the price so different?
Because manufacturers usually take into account that if the bagged price is too high, consumers will be difficult to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is low, or there is no profit, so what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a large increase in the price of the container to ensure their profit space.
As a result, most of the manufacturers are promoting cans instead of bags.
And you want so many manufacturers to spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars every year on advertising, where is the money coming from?
Everyone can imagine.
So with the development of society, the cost of market promotion, such as the cost of promotional personnel in the market, the cost of display in the market, the cost of products, the cost of gifts, the cost of advertising and so on, is also increasing.
Therefore, all manufacturers have also been increasing new products, and the prices have also been rising. In fact, this is a new product with increased market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, their raw material costs will not increase by more than 3 or 4 yuan.
For some brands, in order to promote their products, they resorted to any means. They linked up with doctors at the hospital and asked them to assist in the promotion of their products. The profit from one bottle ranged from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
However, China's relevant laws are absolutely not allowed to carry out such operation methods. In fact, this practice is actually harming consumers.
It is recommended that people buy powdered milk in a bag when there is a jar at home. This can save costs and increase the storage and sealing of powdered milk, and it has no effect on children.
And do not think that the shelf life of the container is longer than that of the bag. If the shelf life of the container is the same as that of the bag after opening the container, it is just that the shelf life of the bag after opening the container is not easy to keep, easy to dampen and degrade.

Don't scare people at the starting line-Xinhuanet
When you go to the book market, you often feel the hype of books on success.
Successful books on success today often promote the "principle of the best" - that is, to assume or imply that you can "do" before telling you what you need to do.
That is to say, it has passed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do".
For this reason, these books have a common feature — — either do it to the best of your ability, or do nothing at all; either is 100, or is 0; either climb Mount Tai, or stay put.
This "principle of the best" makes everyone agree that it is "absolutely correct", but 99 percent will be frightened at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you're determined to make a 180-degree turn and become a new person", which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who are stuck in the past, stuck in the past, and refuse to change, you have to shout at his ear, "You have to change," which is undoubtedly a form of self-deception and playing to the cow.
Most people will be timid in the face of the word "change" and hesitant to make a decision; or they will make a decision on the spur of the moment and take the first step courageously, but it will not last long, and they will not last long.
Mr. Ma Sili's famous sketch "From Tomorrow" is a classic that best expresses this "common humanity".
The biggest problem of the "principle of the best" is that the threshold is too high, which often exceeds the ability limit of the common people, making the vast majority of people "looking for the door".
Perhaps the "second-best principle" is the only way for more ordinary people to take a relatively successful path.
The core of the "second-best principle" is "reducing the threshold" - it encourages a "theory of accumulating small victories into great victories", that is, if you can't do 100, you can do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can climb your front door step, because that is always better than stagnating.
In general, as long as you do something, it is always better than not doing anything.
Since the threshold has been greatly reduced, it is more likely for ordinary people to stick to it, and the probability of success will increase as long as you stick to it.
It is just the path of "second-best principle", which is a little longer.
In summary, although the "optimal principle" is ostensibly aimed at making everyone successful, it can actually only motivate a small number of people; while the "sub-optimal principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

The resource potential of Qinghai Lake裸鲤 has increased by 0.71 million tons this year-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results showed that the resource reserves of Qinghai Lake裸鲤 this year increased by 0.71 million tons to 10.85 million tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial protection period in 2002.
The naked carp in the Qinghai Lake is also known as the "tide fish". It is a rare species of fish in the Qinghai Lake and plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water- fish- bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to the influence of factors such as large-scale human killing and the deterioration of the breeding environment of naked carp, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has sharply decreased. In 2002, the resource potential of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake裸鲤 was listed as endangered species in the China Species Red List.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of the lake and the breeding of fish, prohibiting any unit, collective and individual from Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake to catch the naked carp, and prohibiting the sale of the naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial reproduction and release, as well as the cleaning of the main inflow rivers of the Qinghai Lake and the design of a scientific and reasonable "overfish passage", the protection of Qinghai Lake裸鲤 resources has been continuously strengthened.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, said that up to now, nearly 1.8 billion fish have been released artificially, and the contribution rate to the recovery of Qinghai Lake裸鲤 resources has exceeded 23%.
The Three Gorges Region of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source regulation area in China and even in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area controlling the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Gorges Source Region and the waters of the Qinghai Lake, and to protect aquatic wildlife and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since the beginning of this year, Qinghai has successively issued notices on the prohibition of fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake, and built a "one river, one river, one lake" comprehensive fishing management system.

I just saw a piece of writing about menstruation, too long.
To introduce it to the unknown male.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first menstrual period at some point between the ages of 13 and 15, and menopause will occur around the age of 50.
I will come once a month if I am healthy.
But it is not a rule that can be precisely predicted. It is about a week's difference. It needs to be prepared in advance. Sometimes bad luck will also happen (suddenly a few days earlier).
The length of time, blood volume and degree of menstrual pain are different from person to person. Some people have three days, some people have a week; some people have little blood flow, some people have a massive blood flow; some people have no reaction, some people are so painful that they are sent to the ambulance, and the degree of menstrual pain will change over time. It does not mean that it will never be painful.
The menstrual blood cannot be controlled, and it bleeds for 24 hours from the beginning to the end. I can only use a sanitary pad or tampon to suck blood to prevent it from dripping on my clothes and chair.
The main reason for menstrual pain is the secretion of prostaglandin. It is effective to take ibuprofen as soon as possible before the beginning of the menstrual period to relieve the pain in the same month. It is useless to take it after the beginning of the menstrual period.
During the menstrual period, due to the congestion of the uterus and the excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to suffer from diarrhea.
If it is about the cycle, it will suddenly have diarrhea, and the menstrual period will come in about two days.
The sanitary pad should be changed every two to three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. The worst case is that it is changed six times a day, seven days a month, which is 42 pads. If it is prepared in advance, it may be 50 pads. It is not used every month.
(Here is a modification, the tampon does not need to be changed often, it is about 5-6 hours to change once, and the longest is 8 hours)
During the menstrual period, the hormones may cause more aggression. During the ovulation period, due to the changes in the internal hormones, the mood may be unstable. It is very unfortunate that the body gives itself a thorn.
But the official crime rate data show that the ability of women to control emotions is still very high, and they will not find excuses for emotional problems.
The flow is not only blood, but also detached uterine lining.
After the menstrual period, the uterine lining is the thinnest, and then gradually thickens, which can be understood as that the uterus is a house, building a house (thickening of the uterine lining) every month to prepare for the guests, and when the guests do not come, all the houses are demolished (the menstrual blood is discharged) and a new house is built next month, and the cycle continues.
The menstrual cycle is very inconvenient. For decades, it bleeds for a few days every month and is accompanied by abdominal pain and lower back pain. Who wants it?
However, people can be born because their mothers have menstrual cycles. Menstrual cycles are to prepare a house for you to live in for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank their mothers for having regular and healthy menstrual cycles.
In the past, many things were suppressed for women. The society brainwashed women that they were dirty and shameful. Everyone thought it was like that. But times have changed.
If someone thinks that menstruation is disgusting, and thinks that the body of women is prepared for the birth of life, it is not right to say it in public. Girls stand up and don't think like that. Men who have never experienced it, who will never experience it, and who don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful and disrespectful. How can you face your mother? How can you want your child?
Finally, the sisters tried tampons, and they were really good.
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival. It is disappointing to send wrong.
I have to order another meal for the child
It is hoped that the store will check the quality of the products during the busy period.
Is the foot bathing basin causing numbness?
Choosing a suitable foot bath can have a good effect on foot treatment and health. Today, Guomei's editor will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
As people's health awareness increases, foot baths are increasingly popular with consumers, and there are a large number of different products on the market, ranging from more than RMB 100 to more than RMB 1,000. This gives consumers a great choice.
According to the relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of foot baths and other health-related household appliances are hot, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there is a certain safety risk.
It is too dangerous to soak my feet in the water with electricity.
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday present, but when his father was soaking his feet, he felt tingling in his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but when he turned it off, his father still felt a tingling in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pencil and it lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was charged.
After that, he contacted the merchant, but the merchant's attitude was not bad. Although he cancelled the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation in terms of the highest temperature setting, the target group, and the material used to ensure that it is harmless.
However, in general, foot baths are unlikely to have a problem with electricity, but it is not excluded that some products are not strictly controlled at the time of production.
Therefore, choose a split foot bath when purchasing.
Water and electricity separation, no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take a pen and measure.
The opening ceremony of the 13th Provincial Tea Expo - Vision Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huacheng Online
Hunan Daily News, October 12 (reporter Zhang Shangwu, photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and the introduction of new Hunan red tea were held at the Hunan International Exhibition Center. The exhibition of the tea industry, the innovation of tea technology, the promotion of tea culture, and the acceleration of the goal of the 100 billion tea industry were shown.
Huo Shuyang, deputy director of the Council of the All-China Federation of Supply and Cooperation, and Ye Hongbo, deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand introduction at the opening ceremony: The source of lake red is in Xinyu, and the rise of red tea has injected new impetus into “Five-color Xiang tea”.
In recent years, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion-yuan Xiang tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "three Xiang, four water, five color tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and the main tea categories such as green tea, black tea, and red tea have stepped up their efforts. The main production areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism, leading the vast majority of tea farmers to increase their income.
风水轮流转，红茶又发力。
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after harvesting green tea, harvesting red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens has risen steadily.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark. Xinhua喜捧"湖红之源"。
At the Fujian Red Tea Pavilion, Fujian tea merchants saw a high mountain tea called "Bingri Spring" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Qiang, Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said that the current epidemic and other factors have to some extent affected the tea market, but from the site of the tea expo, there are many highlights.
Xinyue Red Tea is a red tea. It has injected the connotation of tea culture. It has a good reputation and a hot transaction. The Xiang tea industry welcomes the new spring.
Is it possible to cancel if the food is not hot?
I don't want it, because there is no place to park below, so he couldn't deliver it
Metaphysics refers to the study of problems that cannot be answered directly through perception.
Metaphysics is the basic rule of philosophy, aimed at explaining the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation "metaphysics" is derived from the phrase "metaphysics" in the <v>Book of Changes</v> "metaphysics" in the Book of Changes", which was translated by Japanese scholar Takao Iizuka (Meiji era).
The metaphysical branch includes ontology, natural theology and its extensions.
The ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real existence entities and which nouns only represent a concept".
Metaphysical naturalism, which denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolutionary theory.
The method of naturalism refers to the study of God without any words.
Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the essence of consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain).
The dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought on the "relationship between the soul and the body".
Knowledge theory is a philosophical branch that studies the essence, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically studies and thinks about human moral life; here, morality is defined as a set of rules or norms accepted by a group of people or a culture.

It studies what kind of ethical behavior guidelines people should follow), applied ethics (the academic discipline that applies ethical theories to actual living conditions, including bioethics and political ethics), descriptive ethics (the collection of information about how people live, from the observed style)
The examination of ethics is not from the perspective of the expected theory, but from the perspective of the real moral agent (moral agent) who makes real choices and is observed, and it studies the ethical view held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: The ethical thought of humanism, represented by Vala and Montaigne.

Ting Ziliang: To my friend.
I sincerely thank all my friends for the humanitarian aid they gave to us during the 30 years after our family members were killed. Especially since I made an appeal for humanitarian aid to friends both at home and abroad as a private individual in the early 1994.
Nowadays, most of the dead parents of the victims have passed away, and the orphaned children have also grown up and worked.
It is your selflessness that helped us through the most difficult time.
At present, the coronavirus epidemic is ravaging the world, and most of the contributors have reached the age of retirement.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to suspend our humanitarian donations to the mothers of Tiananmen, which should have been a perfect ending to this humanitarian rescue activity.
I will always remember your love and believe that your deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please forgive my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
陶业按：I would like to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the history of the 32 years of humanitarian relief by the IFCSS and the MCDF in Minnesota.
In the process of humanitarian relief, the US Student Aid League and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations. The project executor often crosses.

The relief funds often cannot be delivered to the victims of the June 4.
In 1994, under the suggestion of Tiananmen Mother, a special group was established to coordinate and manage the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, the MCDF established the Education Fund for the Children of the Tiananmen Disaster, and after 11 years, in 2009, all the children of the Tiananmen Disaster graduated from college, the MCDF subsequently established the Special Assistance Fund for the Elderly of the Tiananmen Disaster, and has been in operation ever since.
The funding for these projects comes mainly from donations from the campus and society in the year of the Six-Day War, from individual donations, and is supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Correctional Research Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the descendants of the Tiananmen victims finally received part of the donations that were raised in Hong Kong in the name of Tiananmen on the same day.
During this period, the China Human Rights also independently carried out its humanitarian relief project.
We understand that Mr. Ding called a halt to donations for the Tiananmen Massacre was to consider the donors, and we are indeed old retired people. Our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to thank Mr. Ding for his letter to his friends.
We will respect the decision of the bereaved, terminate this project within two years, and immediately resume when necessary.
I would like to thank and respect all my comrades who have been generous for many years and have risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid.

The photo effect: I took two sets of clothes. Overall, it is not bad. I prefer the picture set.
Service details: I was a little uncomfortable when I was pregnant. The makeup artist and the staff were very considerate. I rested for a while and they kept me hydrated with hot water
Package price: 1000 yuan
Thank you for the review. I thought it was not suitable for the ancient style. I did not expect that the finished product was so beautiful.
Thank you for Dan Dan's recognition. Your satisfaction can make us full of energy and continue to move forward. We will continue to push forward!
This photography studio is really amazing. I strongly recommend all my friends to come!
The reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography and post-production are all flawless.
The makeup artist is very meticulous and will match your style to create a suitable makeup for you. The cosmetics used are all first-class big brands.
Teacher Tian Liang is even more professional in photography.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and there are two little cats playing together.
We are working in Beijing. The better photo studios in Beijing need to queue for half a year in advance. My colleagues have taken photos in Beijing. I have looked at the finished photos and found that they are just so-so.
I have been looking for this studio for a long time, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and I think this is also the short version of most people. Photographer Liguo will capture the natural and wonderful moments.
Make-up artist, photographer, post-production designer, a good team.
We and everyone around us were amazed.
She has recommended her friend to go, and her friend just saw the negative and was also very happy.
I hope that this kind of studio will not be buried, and more people will find it and take pictures of their own style, rather than the same style.
Thank you very much for your five-star comments on Zhan Ying and Jing Lin. Both of you are very creative newcomers. We are the Creative Studio. We will do our best to complete the task as long as the customer likes it. Thank you for meeting each other.
The sweet and nurturing assistant, and the lively and outgoing photographer teacher. Everyone in the team was super nice. It was a wonderful shoot, a unforgettable experience, and the result was much better than I expected. Thanks for your hard work, everyone! 😘😘
Thank you for your review. It is also a kind of blessing to know you. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao It is the same distance as thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to meet you. I will come to Qinhuangdao again next time.

If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you do not have such ideas, it is better to learn by yourself, since the cost of training is very high and it takes six months to learn.
However, if you plan to get into this industry, training is a good choice. Especially for those with weak self-control, training is a good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we need to see the strength of the instructor of this institution. If the strength of the instructor is not strong enough, this training institution has little meaning. Of course, some newly opened training institutions have not very strong instructor strength.
Secondly, before choosing, we should inquire about this training institution, and we should inquire about the students who come out of this institution, because only the students who come out of this institution know this institution is good or bad.
Hello, actually, I don't know how to answer your question because I haven't made a proper introduction about your own situation. And the study of this thing is very related to your own situation.
For example, the subject, the age, the language you want to learn, even the city, all of these will be related to the subject you want to learn or the industry you want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or a computer professional who has graduated, I would personally recommend self-study. This is the cheapest and most efficient way to learn. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also quite good, but the cost of learning is high, the investment is more, and it needs to be concentrated training for 3 to 6 months.
However, if I say these things, self-study is very convenient. Now there are many free learning resources on the Internet, or there are many training resources on B站. If you don't know where to find resources, you can contact me through the introduction to get free resources or detailed consultation.
There are also some classic books that can be combined with videos to learn.
If you are not a computer professional, but you can pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, then it is recommended to learn at a training institution, so that the learning is not very difficult, the teacher explains it very detailed, and there are people specially answering the questions, and in the learning plan or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, and there are internship opportunities, so that the interview process of finding a job can be saved a lot of things.
I have some views above. Because I don't know your situation, I only roughly introduce it, but if you have other questions to consult, you can contact me for communication and exchange.
I said 1 o'clock, I saw it on the app

Life will not disappoint every hardworking person. If you like, please follow me. Thank you for those who are silent and give me a thumbs-up
Life is like this. People only see the result, but you have to bear the process alone. In the face of life, we can only be strong and continue. There is no other choice but to look back and not to look back...
Cleaning is a job, but also a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of services, and services are brilliant because of care.
Although we are doing the most dirty work, we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the customer's home, and see the customer's satisfied smile and raised thumb. At that moment, all the hard work is worth it.
My daily work
Your request, my service.
Serving with care, cleaning with care, and retaining beauty.
You care about the details, Feng Guo Home Service can help you do "clean" what I can, serve the love of the family.
The house is clean, the house is clean, the house is clean, and the house is clean.
Cleaning indoors and outdoors, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp is beautiful, it will become dim if it is not cleaned for a long time. Only after being cleaned can it release its brilliance. Life is the same
To succeed, we must do it with care. We must shape our craftsmanship with meticulousness.
Give me the opportunity, I will make you satisfied. Quality is everything. Because professionalism deserves to be trusted. Your trust is my encouragement!
The current industry is not doing well!
But I always believe that if you have a serious attitude, enough perseverance and enough effort, you will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining!"
The key to a successful day is in the morning. All good starts in the morning. I hope you carry happiness, luck, health and prosperity on your journey. Good morning
When I was young, happiness was a thing, and having it was happiness; when I grew up, happiness was a goal, and achieving it was happiness; when I matured, I discovered that happiness was actually a state of mind, and understanding it was happiness.
Do the most authentic and kindest self, follow your heart, and be unsatisfied with this life; there is only one way in life, and it is to walk your own way; there are two treasures in life: a good body and a good mood, and to live a beautiful life to the end!
Every stage of life will encounter different problems.
In many cases, it is not the ability that constrains you, but the courage to face it positively.
Since it is impossible to avoid, it is better to face it.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by the difficulty; if you face the difficulties, the problems will be solved.
China and Saudi Arabia jointly organize the first contemporary art biennale in Saudi Arabia-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (reporter Wang Hao) -- Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial -- Dierye Contemporary Art Biennial -- was officially opened to the public on November 11 at the Dierye JAX art district located in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and other places such as China took part in the exhibition.
The biennale was jointly planned by the Saudi Darayee Biennale Foundation and the China UCCA Yurans Contemporary Art Center. Tian Yuyu, Director of the China UCCA Yurans Contemporary Art Center, was the artistic director of the biennale.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial is "crossing the river with stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the economic and social transformation period and reflects the current situation of Saudi society and culture.
This year’s biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and is displayed in six interconnected buildings, each of which presents a different theme: “Walking on the Rocks”, “Transmission as an Experiment”, “Border Thinking”, “Advancing to the Public”, “Beautiful New World”, and “On the Spirit of Art”.
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of works on display, including painting, installation art and performance art; the works of 12 Chinese artists have also attracted great attention, and some artists have created new works with recycled materials in a novel way, such as Xu Bing in the "Story Series of the Back Story" (2014) in which he used discarded materials to reconstruct a classic landscape painting.
Barclay, the chief executive officer of the Derry Biennale Foundation, said that he hoped that this Biennale could establish international dialogue and let the global audience have the opportunity to understand the flourishing cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, strengthen interaction and exchange.
Tian Fuyu said, "The goal of the biennial is dual. It is to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue and to enable Saudi audiences to integrate into the contemporary art world. "
It is understood that during the opening week of the biennial, a series of lectures will be held, and artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss themes such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinating and standardizing the management of rural public service positions-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in supporting the employment of poverty-stricken people and consolidating and expanding the results of poverty relief, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote rural revitalization and rural public service positions, helping to fully promote rural revitalization.
According to the person in charge of the Human Resources and Social Security Department of Yunnan Province, at present, 44.83 million rural public service positions have been developed in Yunnan, which are used to help the employment of poor labor force and other rural difficult groups, and play an important role in helping the poor to achieve employment growth, consolidate the achievements of poverty relief, and effectively improve the ability of various rural public services.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including people’s social security in Yunnan, rural revitalization, finance and other departments. It mainly unified the scope of recruitment of rural public service personnel at the grass-roots level, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions.
In terms of job development, the new regulations stipulate that job development should be set up according to the principle of "setting up jobs according to need, people according to jobs, dynamic management, total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person, one job, voluntary publicity, unified management".
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, appointment, on-the-job training and arrangement for on-the-job training.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific duties of the main development department of the rural public service position, the subsidy standard and subsidy method of the rural public service position, and stipulate that the development department of the rural public service position should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for the placement of the rural public service position; require relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution of the rural public service position.

Hello
Can you cancel the order?
I ordered again
Is it cancelled?
The second is that although the right has a good time in history, it is not long, so it is short because it is shining when it is given a little sunshine and sweating when it is given a little boiling water; it is getting more and more satisfied when it is getting more and more satisfied, and it is getting more and more difficult when it is getting more and more difficult.
But to be honest, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
From the definition of the truth standard of the end of the Cultural Revolution, the development of economy, the improvement of science and technology and the promotion of political institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right should not be denied.
For me, although I do not completely agree with Li Weidong's some statements, I am very concerned about his statements and also respect him as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also serious about social problems in China.
However, I opposed his anti-communist theory, and I believed that the anti-essentialist revolution would inevitably lead to social turmoil,民生受损, political groups would be a mess, and foreign countries would take advantage of this.
Fourth, change or improve China requires patience and a sense of responsibility for the country and the people. Those who try to make a political profit from the fire are not rightists, but scoundrels.
Let's talk about left.
Left, in fact, is a bunch of time and political orphans.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed, but the left has no such luck, because the left wants what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Fifth: I recently saw some friends criticizing the leftist while refuting the rightist, which was quite energetic. I think it is unnecessary.
Do not try to reason with the traitor or the leftist. They are all one-minded and have no reason to argue.
Do not try to prove that we are right, and do not think that the adversary and left mad can admit it. Why?
I tell my friends this way: When the traitor insults you five cents, when the left madman insults you right dog, it just proves that our middle way is right!
Many people had ideals when they were young, but forgot their ideals as they grew old, or pursued their ideals but became obsessed.
And the ideal gradually fades away, and even the dragon boy becomes a dragon.
I think it means restraint and freedom. From the perspective of history and culture, China as a whole should be to the left.
At home, the right wing is more concerned with efficiency and development, while the left wing is more concerned with fairness and safety.
At present, the general trend of society is to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, China and the United States are competing, and the left is certain. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, I can just give a thumbs up
I don't want to say anything else. Flower is just like this.
In the past two years, the blockade and encirclement of the United States on Huawei's chips have not only caused Huawei unprecedented difficulties, but also caused "US-based" enterprises to suffer huge losses.
The United States has suppressed the Chinese chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and allied countries to block the Chinese chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in a decrease in the research and development investment of chip production enterprises and a decline in production capacity. This has led to a shortage of the chip supply chain at the global level.
At present, the "芯" shortage has affected all major industries around the world, such as the suspension of car production and the rise in mobile phone prices. All industries that use chips have suffered greatly.
In order to grasp the "芯片" independence, more and more countries' technology giants are beginning to take the road of "going away from the United States".
In order to firmly grasp the control over the global semiconductor industry and restrain the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry, the US has been making frequent moves recently. It is hosting the "IC Summit". It is also inviting 64 major companies to establish a semiconductor alliance, and allocating funds to support the US domestic technology giants, such as, the US old technology giant Intel has invested $2 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and opened the chip manufacturing business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will cause a certain impact on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and is likely to steal Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's "job".
This is because Intel, as an old US technology giant, has been deeply rooted in the semiconductor field for decades, with a large number of talent teams and technical reserves. It is certain to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, the founder of Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC, TSMC, did not pay much attention to this decision of Intel.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement. He had no hesitation in saying that Intel's construction of a wafer plant was quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongmou is very disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field because Zhang Zhongmou still has grievances against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was always a gem in the US manufacturing industry, standing at the top of the world, and was the world's dominant semiconductor.
By the 1980s, the world’s high-end semiconductor chips were in the hands of a few strong people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, in which the chip was designed, manufactured and tested by one factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model is too heavy for some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are only able to look away from the huge production line construction costs.
Under the impetus of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to show the phenomenon of division and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, he believed that since there was a company specializing in design, it could be established a special factory for the manufacture of wafers.
Shortly after that, Zhang Zhongmou's idea became reality, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was born.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has targeted the single link of "wafer processing" as its main business, which does not involve design, but only provides the subcontract service of wafer manufacturing.
At that time, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which had just been founded, was a mere subordinate to Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou has sought investment from Intel, but at that time, when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it was obviously too high, despising TSMC, and resolutely refusing to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believes that Intel was arrogant at the time.
I didn't expect that the giants who despised the manufacture of wafers would now have to start doing wafer fabrication.
So, Zhang Zhongmou felt that Intel's entry into wafer fabrication was very ironic.
Nowadays, the market value of Taiwan Semiconductor has exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of the strong offensive of Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel is naturally not willing to be stagnant.
At present, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has rushed to the 3nm chip, while Intel is still stuck at 7 years ago 14nm.
It is not easy to catch up.
Not waiting

Today, let's look at some strange hot searches.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot topics were selected at random: February 2 Dragon Rising, Hao Li You Price Increase, and Logistics Incident, and the public opinion spread to form a peak, then the index (smoothing curve) finally dissipated, and if there was secondary public opinion, there would be a small hump again.
They look the same as the "Network Public Opinion Evolution Model" that the Cyberspace Administration of China showed on its official website.
What is an abnormal public opinion?
The six hot topics selected at random from the same event are presented in the form of a solitary peak, a serrated peak, and a cliff.
The shape of a lonely peak is that the topic is artificially heated, and it is quickly on the hot search list, attracting the attention of the public. The shape of a sawtooth is that the topic is periodically heated to ensure that the topic is on the hot search list. The shape of a cliff is that the entire group evacuates, and the hot search has played its "function" and is about to take on a new mission and enter a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat wave of an event coincides with the trough of another event. The time is exactly the same, and it is certain that a unified batch of water forces received the task and launched a new round of offensive.
It can be seen from the professionalization of black public relations: dozens of hot searches are listed at the same time. Which attracts the eye, which is responsible for popularization, which leads to war, which transfers the focus, which influences cognition, which misleads judgment, which incites emotions, which is entangled in decision-making, which is divided into batches and nodes, and which almost takes into account all the elements of public opinion dissemination.
Communication is a science that disregards all subjective factors such as position and emotion, and only relies on objective data. Black PR will also disappear.
Everything that passes must leave a trace. Such a trace, let's dig it out together.

Mauritius and other countries have found the first cases of infection with the Ometrix strain - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 -- According to the report of the overseas reporters of Xinhua News Agency, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of infection with the mystery strain of the novel coronavirus.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron virus on the 10th.
According to Kailash Jagutpal, Minister of Health of Mauritius, one infected person was a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27; the other was a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive after contact with a person who recently visited South Africa and returned.
After being isolated in the hospital, the two infected people had negative nucleic acid tests. They have now returned to their respective residences.
Cyprus Health Ministry announced on October 10 that the country had confirmed 3 cases of infection with the Ometrix strain for the first time.
These three people are students. They returned from abroad last month. Since they were mild cases, they were not hospitalized.
In order to prevent the spread of the Ometrix virus, the government of Senegal has continuously increased the prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers aged 12 and above arriving by air will have to pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport after landing.
On October 10, the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia also announced that it would begin to vaccinate children aged 5 to 11 years old with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
On September 9, the Minister of Health of Malawi, Kumbizhe Chimbonda, said that the country had found 3 cases of infection with the O. tsutsugamushi strain for the first time.
The country's health sector conducted genome sequencing on 12 positive samples collected from Nov. 9 to Dec. 2, and found the three infected cases.

Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I called your staff and explained
Your rider told me that the address is too far away
The 360-degree integrated home
Address: 156 Ring Road,幸福家园12楼
At first, it was introduced by friends because of trust. So I chose to come and see. My budget was 70,000 for a basic renovation.
He started a series of deception at the store.
I was the first time to the store just to show my floor plan to them. They did not measure the house on the spot. They gave me a price of RMB 70,000 for my 135-square-meter house. They showed me their materials but did not know what kind of materials they were.
Their second trick is that if you just go to the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and once you pay the deposit, you will never be able to get it back, unless you have enough experience and can fight them in court).
When I was hesitant about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that you would get a certain amount of discount just by paying the deposit today.
This is a big pitfall. I am an example of being deceived. When I was impulsive, I paid more than 10,000 yuan in deposit.
He gave me a lot of problems with his quotation, which did not include any renovation of water and electricity, including any door and cabinet in the bathroom, and these three were the biggest part of the basic cost.
In addition to these, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies.
I lost trust in this company, and I signed the contract without any explanation at the beginning.
When I went to get my money back, they showed a lot of experience, with a special team to deal with you.
In any case, it is the problem of the customer. They have no responsibility.
All kinds of excuses, and many details, I don't want to say one by one are tears, in general, don't choose them, because my friend also asked them to renovate the house, and the quality is also bad. In the future, you will be charged with various fees.
Shame on them, they are the original leading decoration that deceives people, and now they have changed to big beauty, which seems to have failed again and again.
So don't choose such a shitty construction company.
In the future, when people choose, they should look up these things on Baidu and ask for advice because the renovation is not small money.

Stars in the sky. The Gemini meteor shower will arrive at its peak on the 14th-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (reporter Zhou Rujian) Astronomic科普专家介绍， As the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Gemini Meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will arrive at its peak on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe it after midnight.
On December 13, 2018, Beijing astronomer An Jiu took a photograph of the Gemini meteor shower in Qinghai Province.
Most meteor showers have their mother bodies as period comets, but the mother body of the Gemini meteor shower is the 3200 asteroid Phaethon, which is an Apollo asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that does not originate from a comet.
Shu Lipeng, a member of the Astronomical Society of Tianjin and an astronomical科普 expert, said that just like the new year blockbuster, the Gemini meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the "opening schedule" can be from December 4 to December 17.
The meteor shower is well known for its large and stable flow, and is called the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere together with the Perseids and the Leonids.
One notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is the slow speed of meteoroids, rich colors, and many fire meteors. It is suitable for beginners in both visual observation and astronomical photography.
On December 13, 2020, Yang Jing, an amateur astronomer in Tianjin, took a photograph of the Gemini meteor shower in Tianjin Baodi.
According to astronomical forecasts, this year's Gemini meteor shower will arrive at its peak at about 15:00 on December 14. At the peak, the ZHR (in ideal observation conditions, when the radiation point is above the head) is 150.
The recommended index chart of the Gemini meteor shower.
Last year, the Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be affected by the moonlight, and the beauty will be slightly reduced.
The 14th is the 11th day of the 11th month of the Lunar Calendar, and the lunar phase is a crescent moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall later in the night, and at this time, the radiant point of the Gemini流星雨 will rise higher.
Fans of meteor showers can observe them in the hours after the moon sets, but they should keep warm to prevent hypothermia. "
How can we observe more meteors?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a high altitude, small light pollution, east-north-east facing location in the suburbs or in the countryside, and then patiently wait for the moon to fall, and then observe visually.
It should be noted that the流量 of the Gemini meteor shower is very large in all directions. It is not necessary to keep looking at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
If you are a lover of photography, you should choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens to take pictures of a beautiful "流星雨". When shooting, use a high ISO and the largest aperture.
In view of stability and continuity, tripod, spare battery and shutter line are also indispensable. "
Xiao Lin reminded.
What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the subject refers to the LCD TV. The differences in market positioning between the laser TV and the LCD TV are mainly as follows:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TVs themselves are born for the large screen.
At present, the mainstream LCD TVs are generally 55-65 inches, while the sizes of laser TVs are generally 75 inches and above, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting the user's demand for a large screen TV.
In recent years, the global shipment and sales ratio of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the overall TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the prediction of Zhongyi Kang, in 2020, the market sales of laser TVs will increase by more than 140% and continue to grow at a high speed.
The good performance in the big screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in terms of eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eye. Compared with the backlight source of the LCD television, the imaging process is closer to the natural condition of the object's imaging process, and the stimulation to the eyes is smaller.
The laboratory of the China Electronics Technology Standardization Research Institute and the ophthalmologists of the Beijing Tongren Hospital conducted a strict comparison experiment on the effect of laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions on 144 groups of test data.
The data confirmed that the laser TV indeed has strong eye protection characteristics, and even has certain improvement in certain aspects.
At a time when the importance of eye health is increasingly being recognized, laser TVs not only attract more and more users with their eye-friendly advantages, but also open up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the downward trend of the price of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are generally more than 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price is gradually climbing.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It is certainly reasonable.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be realized by LCD TV and projector.
With the help of ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is relatively shorter than that of traditional projection equipment. It can realize a 100-inch screen experience at a short distance. The required space is not big, and the main body is small and occupies little space.
In terms of brightness, the large brand laser TV can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generated is lower, so the equipment is less likely to be damaged, and the lifespan of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models also carry many cutting-edge technologies such as real 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, and biomorphic screen, which can bring users a more shocking visual and auditory experience.
It is not a fake demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and return on investment, the laser TV is not the dish of audio and video players. If you want to balance the screen and the viewing environment, you can try. There are advantages and disadvantages in everything, and you can make a judgment after weighing the pros and cons. The only thing to be afraid of is listening to one side.
To put it simply, the ultra-wide-angle close-up projector - laser TV, in order to get close to the screen, it must use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to block part of the environmental light, use a micro-structure Fresnel screen, which is very expensive. The price of 80 inches is basically equivalent to that of a 65-inch LCD.
There is one more thing, I especially dislike that projection manufacturers put the good of diffuse reflection for the eyes as the selling point. Please, the light that the eyes can see on the screen is the direct light for the eyes. You diffuse reflection to the ceiling, the eyes cannot see it. If you insist that the LCD TV is also diffuse reflection, what about the ceiling when you turn on the TV?
In addition, if the projection screen is not a漫反射, it will not become like.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen was completely ignored, and a large amount of light was reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which was really uncomfortable.
The Visual Art Photography Gallery has selected quality stores temporarily.
When I added the appointment date on WeChat, the young lady sent me the available time slots and I got the reply quickly.
Before going, I looked at the store's shooting works, more of outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful, involving a lot of shooting styles.
After arriving on the same day, I briefly exchanged my ideas with the sister, who was very patient and helped me try two styles of clothes that I was indecisive about, and finally decided to start makeup and hair styling. The photographer would set up some props before shooting, and guide the action. He was very meticulous about every detail.
However, it may be because I did not communicate with you about the specific shooting ideas, so the style I shot was not what I wanted, but it was pretty.
After the photo is taken, the photographer will help choose the photo, and communicate the style of the later stage, which is quite thoughtful.
The repaired film takes about half a month, waiting for the effect~
The second time to win a photo shoot. Most of the clothes can choose one.
Finally, I chose a black tulle skirt to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about two hours. The makeup + shooting. The photographer who took the photos is the younger brother of the 95th generation. I feel a little shy. I hope that in the future, I can give more suggestions to the customer about the shooting action guide. He is very talkative. The shooting process is quite pleasant.
The Visual Art Photography Gallery selects the best quality store
I am on the first page, and I will also visit Queenie.
I filled in my name and phone number before coming to the store. I could choose my wedding gown. I changed three or four wedding gowns. I was very patient. The service attitude was good. I learned how to pose in the later shooting. My face was very big in the photo. The fine-tuning said it would take half a month. I got it in three or four days. I felt it was not different from the original photo.
The environment is generally good.
There are many optional clothes.
There are three locations for makeup, and the inside is a studio.
The service is very warm and very careful.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the movement.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also propose to take a new photo.
(Experience) The shape may be a little too much, and the original double eyelid was put on three eyelids.
The eyebrows were also trimmed, which was a little embarrassing for me because I don't usually wear eyebrows.
The picture has been sent for ten days, but the P picture effect is not very satisfied. I feel that the eyelid tape is still obvious.
Because it is not clear what style to choose, I have tried two styles. Finally, I chose the black dress. The little girl said that this style is more in the style of Audrey Hepburn.
After choosing the clothes, I began to do my makeup and hair. The hairdresser and makeup artist were very patient and helped me a lot. I was very satisfied with the result.
After getting ready, I started taking pictures. The photographer had me pose for the whole time. It was very easy and harmonious.
After shooting, he carefully chose four of his favorite photos as the final cut. The little brother said that it would be ready in 15 days. The ending was very satisfied.
I have not been able to reply for three days... because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay
I have to pay for every shipment now
Can I be exempted first and then charge my monthly fee after your investigation?
Is it safe to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Little umbrella is an Internet insurance broker platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the guidance of the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokers (2015 Revision)", to become an insurance broker, it must meet three key words: shareholders, founders with no major violations in the past three years, with a minimum capital of RMB 50 million, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are actually very strict. In summary, it is necessary to have strength, to be approved by the National Authority Department of the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (the national authority department of the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, which supervises all insurance companies and banks in the country), and the shareholders must have a good style. As a small umbrella insurance company, insurance broker, the insurer does not need to question whether the small umbrella insurance is legitimate or not, as long as there are these three thresholds, no insurance company can achieve this.
At this point, it is not bad, and it is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: Xiaoyu insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' star life insurance products are sold on this platform. For example, the latest listing of Tianhe Super Mario 5 life insurance. The insurer and the insurer are Tianhe Life Insurance. Xiaoyu insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so it is not necessary to question its credibility.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products are generally more affordable because of the reduction of operating costs and the cost of salaries of business agents. The payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the payment pressure of the insured person, and at the same time, it can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the point of view of the professionalism of businessmen: this is particularly important, because insurance is a highly professional industry. Many Internet products can be insured by customers themselves. This will lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health declaration and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective consciousness when they insure themselves. They think they are healthy or meet the requirements. This is easy to cause many risks of denial of insurance. There is a risk of being denied insurance.
I have done insurance phone sales on “Tencent Microinsurance” (the same as Xiaoyu伞, also an Internet insurance brokerage platform). I am very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is real and reliable. Unreliable are people. There are no professionals in the Internet channel, and there are many sales misunderstandings.
For example, 1 yuan insurance covers 600,000 yuan, buy insurance and get a mobile phone, free 6 million yuan of critical illness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the main point, they will not tell the insured person that the first month is 1 yuan, the second month is normal, and the price is different, from tens to 200, many customers do not know what they bought for a few years.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company would pay 600,000 yuan (The sky is falling).
Free mobile phones are only sent to customers with special insurance numbers such as 66666 and 88888, and if the winning message is sent, the customer will not exchange it and no one will remind him.
(This is another pitfall for the insurer) Free 6 million-dollar coverage for catastrophic illnesses is short-term. If only this, without other commercial insurance, 6 million dollars can do what? It cannot solve the problem. Life begins to run naked.
At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales.
Therefore, on the whole, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, and the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the business agent.
It is suggested that the subject should carefully consider the overall situation. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, more opportunities for customers to choose products, and some products have a better price than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers, insured offline products, and saved 2000-3000 yuan/year for each person.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker, with 3 years of enterprise management training experience, more than 1,000 enterprise users, more than 100 insurance companies, before insurance, I will start from the needs of the customer to customize the insurance product for the customer, during the insurance period, I will compare three insurance companies for the customer to try to get the best insurance result for the customer, after insurance, I will do the insurance document management for the customer to make the customer feel safe and secure.
To grow with every customer.
I hope my answer can help the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance supervision department, Internet insurance is insurance business in which the insurer can complete all the insurance process after the insurer clicks the insurer link.
In the process, the insurer does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All the steps can be completed by the insurer.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance has little "ceremony", and even may not have a printed contract, it does not affect the effectiveness and legality of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the "telephone sales" general line production, but such insurance purchase will also have a fatal problem - the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for several decades. When we buy insurance, should we not think carefully about the "mediator" we have chosen, and whether it is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide services for us many years later?

From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and insult, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can accommodate everything, but we must eliminate this villain.
If you don't look at parties and factions, the first thing to be opposed is this uncivilized style.
From the moment you sent me a Facebook request to add you as a friend, and then posted satirical posts, to the moment you tried to publish the so-called location of my home and the name of my father on social media, I have taken an unresponsive attitude.
After that, you went out of your way to tag me every day for six meals, and then, on Facebook, you continued to discuss with your so-called friends about some hidden and humiliating remarks about me, such as my appearance, my body, my good breeding, and so on, and so on. I...
I didn't know that later I received a lot of friends sending me a picture of your face book friends and a statement with sexual harassment.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can't keep silent anymore.
After uploading the news that I called the police, you have not calmed down at all, but have become more and more insolent.
I don't care about your political background or your status, in our society, it is necessary to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this kind of humorous, subtle, humiliating, and insulting remarks. You can also continue to say that you only care about and care about me. You can continue to think that this is not harassment. You can even continue to deny that it is not your picture or continue to publish all offensive remarks.
No, I cannot and I have no ability to stop you.
I do not know you, nor do I want to know you, and my appearance and figure do not require your criticism.
I don't even think there would be any girl who would be willing to humiliate herself in this way to gain fame.
My friend asked me, are you okay?
I said yes, and you wouldn't believe me.
I think no girl can say she is okay after being bullied like this.
No matter at work, in society, in politics or in business, only those who have no basic ethics will choose this way to hurt any woman.
I believe that justice is in the heart of the people.
I cut part of the comment for you to judge
No one can impersonate you, right?
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization

The opening ceremony of "Intelligence Integration of Xiangyang" 2021 China International Railway Transportation and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit - Rolling News - Hunan Daily Network - Huacheng Online
Hunan Daily News on October 12 (full media reporter Zhou Qianheng) On September 9, "Intelligence in Xiangyang" 2021 China International Railway Transportation and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit opened in Zhuzhou.
Wang Cheng, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of Organization of the Provincial Party Committee, attended the launch ceremony and delivered a speech.

US Three Aircraft Carriers Concentrate on China’s Periphery and the Most Powerful Weapon is a Rare Visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Multiview The Communist Party of China media Multiview reported: The latest news on Sino-US relations: The latest satellite image shows that US three aircraft carriers are concentrating on the periphery of China; the US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy’s arsenal is a rare visit to Guam, which sends an important signal to the US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the “Strategic Situation Awareness Platform of the South China Sea”, a Chinese think tank, on January 9, the satellite found the US “Carl Vinson” (USS Carl Vinson) aircraft carrier near the Strait of Balabac.
Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the West Pacific.
The platform expects that the “Carl Vinson” will deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the “Carl Vinson” carrier has carried the F-35C fighter and the CMV-22 “鱼鹰” amphibious transport aircraft.
In addition to the “Carl Vinson”, there is also the “USS Abraham Lincoln”, which departed from the United States on January 3.
The “Lincoln” also carried the F-35C fighter squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently deploys in the Asia-Pacific region is the “Ronald Reagan” aircraft carrier (USS Ronald Reagan) docked in Sasebo, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the “Shandong Lake” missile cruiser and the “Stokdal” missile destroyer.
US Three Aircraft Carriers Concentrate in the Perimeter of China and the Most Powerful Weapons are Rare Visits to Guam On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite pictures, showing that three US aircraft carriers were concentrated in the perimeter of China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) The US Navy’s three aircraft carriers gathered around China’s periphery. The most powerful weapon rarely visited Guam on January 17, 2022.
According to a report by CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the arsenal of the US Navy visited the island of Guam for the first time in a long time.
USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. Guam naval base on Saturday (January 15).
US three warships gather in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon rarely visits Guam. Analysts said that this was a signal sent to allies and enemies in the Indian-Pacific region, which is becoming increasingly tense.
This is the first visit of the US ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
US three warships gather around China’s periphery, and the most powerful weapon rarely visits Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea in recent years.
The picture shows the Yongsheng Island in the South China Sea.
(South China Sea Research Forum) In the statement, the US Navy said that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada" to Guam this time strengthened cooperation between the US and its allies in the region and showed the US' capabilities, flexibility, readiness and commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are usually called "boomer submarines".
The movements of 14 “Thunder Submarines” in the US Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secret around the ballistic missile submarine has made the "Raygun Submarine" the most important survival weapon in the "Nuclear Triad," which also includes ballistic missiles located on the American mainland and B-2 and B-52 bombers that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking to friends about the recent drop of 26% in Meta, the market capitalization evaporated 2510 billion US dollars, Zuckerberg responded that "it faced unprecedented competition", the reason why?
Meta (originally Facebook) is actually an advertising company. Its income is mainly from advertising. Today, a profitable advertising company has its own traffic channel.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and so on, regardless of the function positioning, are all Meta's traffic channels.
In addition, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", and many apps are connected to Meta. Through Meta's advertising platform, it is possible to realize revenue.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta is difficult to get the data and information of users, affecting the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is friendly to users, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow the App to obtain their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google hits another blow, the impact on Meta's income will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in the income growth of Meta has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Meta receives at least 10% of its income from China every year, mainly from companies in China making sea business.
Meta's office in Hong Kong has about a hundred people, and there are several major agents in the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas market, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel. The money they spend is mostly on Meta.
Interestingly, at present, TT is one of the main competitors of Meta, but in the past two years, Meta has made a lot of money from TT.
All the agents in China are helping ByteDance to advertise to Meta, and the performance of Meta in China is also good.
Recently, I have not gone out to learn about it, but I am sure it will not be better than before.
Chinese companies have passed the stage of massive spending overseas.
Third, the new flow channel expansion is not successful.
Facebook is getting older and older, and new platforms such as TT are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only concerned with income, but also with the future.
It is obvious that Meta's expectation is not enough.
In order to tell a new story for the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "original universe".
The Yuan Universe is indeed one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the Yuan Universe is relatively long. This story in the past two or three years is not enough to support the market value of Meta.
So in the next two years, it should be a difficult period for Meta.
Although Facebook is very prosperous now, with annual income of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars, it is actually that Facebook has strong sense of crisis. Compared with other Internet enterprises and high-tech companies, there is no good and safe moat.
Although his several social software now have a high daily active user, they are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of TikTok's rapid development, Facebook has little confidence, and the disruption is just a blink of an eye.
And the concept of the ultimate universe, which is unreachable, has no hope of success in the short term. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous. This is also the reason why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company again and again and constantly looking for new tracks. But I think his track choice is wrong, a one-way road.
