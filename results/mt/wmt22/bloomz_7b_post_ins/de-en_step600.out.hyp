The goods cost under 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the goods value...
I am #PRS_ORG# major and therefore it is not a problem for me.
I only need a number or an instruction, so that the package can be tracked to you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249 euros.
It costs 179 euros today.
I find it very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and order again for the better price or is there another way of signing the contract?
I also think that children should not be taught to take on an adult role for their little siblings.
However, I find that it is good to take care of the small ones in size.
Quick look, quick help, take the bottle etc.
They learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still have enough children, I see no problem.
If your K1 is alone for the short time and it is OK for him, that's good.
You can judge for yourself whether this is suitable for your children.
It is not so that he should wiggle around and sleep for hours.
It is likely that it is right.
Maybe that's why the psychologist said that.
Because if something actually happened, such as a fire, an earthquake, an alien invasion etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to worry about K2.
If this is a risk you want to take, then of course it's your choice;)
Help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title is no longer appealing to me maybe someone knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a dog walker commits suicide by swallowing food and falling to his death.
The case will be taken over by a commissioner after a short investigation into his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats patients.
The commissioner has a small nickname and also has a fear (of fire) and landed in this therapist.
It leads to more self-murder and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned to go to the site of the self-murder and document it and put the photos online.
In the end, it turns out that this therapist is operating a type of ground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip in their brain that suppresses the centre of fear in the brain and the patients ultimately put their fear to the extreme.
(A woman jumps out of the window and another is going to die with intent)
This is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic where the fire had to be put out.
This is how the book was published, I am quite sure that the book was published in its original form by a French author / author.
If this action is known to someone or even if someone can suggest the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh no, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I need to contact my husband.
This can take time.
What steps should I take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Kind, 4 j., Splitter under the Daumennagel
Kind, four years old, has over the entire length of the wood splitter under the daumennagel (side).
He tried to lift him with a pin.
Very difficult to grasp.
Hat nicht geklappt und weh getan
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try it.
No chance.
I am going to the doctor tomorrow.

Wegen Omikron: Johnson will Auffris chimpung vorantreiben
New cases of omicron concern politicians and scientists in Great Britain.
This is why all eligible adults in England should receive an invitation by next year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to take a more proactive approach to the coronavirus outbreak in light of rapidly increasing numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a video message to his countrymen.
Until now, the deadline was at the end of January.
The British government will also provide support to speed up the campaign in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the case of the Omikron variant, Johnson said, a contingency plan is in place, requiring urgent intensification of infection control.
The good news is that the protection level could be raised with a third dose.
Johnson said: "Let's get you excited now!"
On Sunday, 1239 more omicron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. DPA
Will the full amount be reimbursed from the purchase price at cancellation?
I am for all to use pronouns
I have sent an application.
Today, the invitation came by email.
I want to respond to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a more complicated name.
I have hypnotized him and according to where he has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write an email now.
Can someone help me?
I am an alien and I also do not want to be treated like a criminal.
Conclusion: Everyone should use pronouns.
I have 5 books.
Four of them.
I only bought that today
Obviously, the chair had a lack of visibility.
How can such a crime occur after nine months?
Only on the #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working since around.
No more for 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books over the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are again available and I want to add two seats to the order and put this in my account.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help it.
Content warning: I will write something more detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something from the heart.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
There is a theme that really nags at me and unfortunately it happens too often that many victims do not help or we could not help them.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can do nothing about such situations.
I see the blue dots, the blood, the closed eyes...
But even in conversation with four eyes, with the perpetrator, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of anger, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of entering the children from this.
I always wanted to be clear about everything, partly very close to tears, all are worth without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to accept violence.
I often wish I could help... I know I can't.
But it will never be light.
Please think about it, always remember that it is worth living without violence, that is so important.
Arcane on Netflix: What does the series have in common with "League of Legends"?
Many fantasies, many complicated names, a daunting ambition: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently been started on Netflix.
Why are we happy about the already announced two series?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on young Johannes Patrick.
Nothing new: For the second time in three months, the leaders lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the match, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with a view to the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have a little bit of fear in the bag."
After the game, however, the hat did not get in place - but was once again sanctioned in view of the 61-72 (28-38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
More than the naked result, the way of the performance disappointed.
The headline is a statistic that summarizes the entire dilemma: The three-quarters quote represents 13 percent, four hits (all by young Johannes Patrick) on the board and 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick gave the answer: "We were not focused enough after the victory at Teneriffa, and we did not implement what we have trained."
To move the ball.
His opponent, Sebastian Gleim, reacted quite differently: "A nice game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It has been felt like before 10,000 people.
Only 750 spectators were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they came for free.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team to victory.
The best coach I have trained, praised Gleim.
While the performance leaders in Patrick's team were Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7).
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the leaders prevent a total debacle and came back to eight points, after they had already lost 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored 12 points.
Unfortunately, there is no time to wait.
On Wednesday (19 p.m.), the Riesen received the skyliners Frankfurt, before also in Ludwigsburg the maximum 750 spectators.
We had another email address earlier, but I changed it.
Yes, I reported it a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all performance claims were rejected.
We have once again informed them of this and have once again written to them.
We had already reported this half a year ago.
Max Raabe is 59
He wants to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he can actually perform.
Max Raabe actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But there is nothing there.
The concert was scheduled to take place in May 2022 - "at the request of the authorities" to combat the Corona virus.
Even other performances scheduled for the Advent season have to fall by the wayside for the time being, as it says on the singer's website (www.palast-orchester.de) and that of his musicians.
From January, the artists want to extend their 2020 terms, which were already due to expire due to the pandemic.
Max Raabe was born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalia town of Lünen. As a teenager, he had already sung a lot and a lot.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his comrades.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the comedian harmonist.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place of the charts - just like his success album "For women is not a problem" (2013).
He has managed to get it into the mainstream.
Max Raabe is no longer to be missed from the current German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück", he has been on tour since 2020. DPA
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small piece of the furniture before?
It could be supplemented with existing furniture and we could control whether it matches
It still does not work I can only see the deck sheet but not fold it.
Federal building minister Klara Geywitz: Through demolition no new building
The new Federal Building Minister, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the construction of large apartment blocks, as has been demanded in Berlin in a popular vote.
Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sonntag): "With a change of ownership, there is no new building, only the ownership structure changes."
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
Of course, a colourful mix of private landlords, tenants or housing associations is the best protection against a Monopol image.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Linkspartei wants to set up an expert commission to look at the outcome of the people's vote.
But if the situation does not improve, Geywitz is not going to talk to the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening in the rental market.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent cap until 2029, limits on rent increases in high-rise residential areas and the expansion of the rent cap.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice as soon as possible.
If the housing market does not improve despite all efforts, "we will have to talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to make a purchase and after a few days I realized I had forgotten the last step in the payment process.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be ready again?
Or is it coming again?

This is absolute freedom
At least 100 dead by tornado in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been reported in the US.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 people could be killed.
The pictures from there remind me of a war zone.
On Saturday night in the US, several tornadoes caused severe destruction and may have caused up to 100 deaths.
The quakes leave a roughly 320 km long scar of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area that everything is back to normal.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just out.
Part of the industrial equipment is in the walls.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible at all.
He is expecting up to one hundred dead in the state of Kentucky alone, official figures say.
Hello, I just saw that the #NAME# has been sold.
This is very bad.
Do you still produce?
Or is it completely from the collection?
Is there the possibility to order this display in another country?
Until when do you want to report?
If the delivery cannot take place in my home, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but I can only place an order now and send it to Germany, which is in the cart?
I had responded to the contact form with an article or a refund and wanted to ask if it was received or processed, as I had not received confirmation yet.
Companies pay penalties and change advertisements
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for an impounding premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees the opportunity to get paid for cleaning up.
As a result, they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today demanded financial incentives for a ban.
The design of advertisements to call for donations - following the example of Germany - is also intended to increase the readiness to donate to the Corona crisis.
He has been transferred to another company.
This makes his situation worse than yours.
Drinks and tea.
It's a year ago.
He has not been seen at his old place and has been looking for something else.
You can also do that.
And that he did not like at the time: no matter.
He also did not find his job well.
There are too many variables.
Please cancel the cancellation.
This is then very relevant.
I take a screen shot.
Good day - I have interest in the Boone dinner, white.

Help with first own campaign
Boron at the bottom!
I am currently planning a trip for a group of four friends, and I want to take my heroes on a campaign specifically written for players.
We play DSA 5.
The bulk of the book is made up of the confessions of the evildoers and their motives, the individual acts examined and now I am working on writing the first chapter of the journey and polishing my own sentences at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a freight train with goods from Gratenfels in a small village near the Thuran Sea.
Further action is to take place there.
Some miles from the village, the heroes are supposed to summon a group of goblin and lock them in a storage room.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: to convince, to act, to threaten, to recognize danger early on, which is always good for the players.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and arrows
In the absence of marks, the goblins lead the heroes in a straight line and flank them with three left and right bows, while two with spears stop the boat.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes fall, I have two solutions
First, the heroes are all discovered and murdered by the son of the village headmaster, a half-elf.
The car is naturally missing.
If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-back with two of his legs grips the ball with two of his legs and comes to the help of the heroes in the fight.
The car is still there, everything is super.
How does Haltet ihr Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much for adventure?
The Goblin Group will play a decisive role later, so it's not just cannons.
Edited: Wow, I hadn't counted on so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee many of your ideas and now I also have more confidence in my narrative.
I have built the lamp again.
And again together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
I would still like to send it back
Then you can get the backside, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I am a fan of Sky Sport F1
Hello F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German sky has been getting worse and worse, so I want to make a little air with this post.
For the first time, the transfer was broken today in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 report.
Despite the delayed start and the start accident, the time plan was far behind the plan, but one could still show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!)
It seems, however, that for legal reasons the F1 has priority and therefore has to limit itself to everything else, so that Sky DE probably had no choice.
Despite this, Sky UK has agreed to carry the race.
However, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has led the difficult situation through the difficult accident.
Then there was a rule breach by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, who did not realise that under a red flag the brakes could be changed.
Although this situation has already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both were only able to reach the conclusion that Verstappen should be allowed to change the tires when he gave Hamilton appropriate questions on this topic.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that this was possible for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that such fundamental rules should simply be known when one is commenting on F1 on a pay TV channel.
It is not the first time this has happened, which is now according to the rules possible or prescribed, but both have simply constant doubts about the rules.
In general, I do not like the artificial comment style of Roos, but there is a taste for it.
But I think Heiko Wasser of RTL is even better.
In addition, there are constant annoyances, which just work unprofessionally, such as ordering coffee at (also unprofessional) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the last one brings a lot of unrest in the comments, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least because advertising is easy on Sky, in the catch-up zone Sky is the only broadcaster going into advertising, as you can see on F1TV, where the German commentary can be heard straight after the race.
Weder ServusTV noch ORF tun das.
These two broadcasters also make less advertising in the training than Sky, and this as a free TV channel.
However, one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, which alone does not allow me to see the consequences.
The rest of the program of Sky Sport F1 is also very weak and full of repetitions.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster to cover F1.
Unironically, RTL is making a better job of advertising in the four races that they are allowed to compete in.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes a lot less fun than it would be with a normal channel.
I would like to hear your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# - Pendelleuchte, Messing and more
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me on Monday that it will be sent, and the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she has never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on December 12, 2019.
One of them already had a defect after relatively short time (the material has a hole in the upper part of the stem).
I request support.
Lüfterpumps are particularly suitable for providing an aquarium with additional heating.
It is also possible to use a filter system over the air.
This series is offered in 3 versions from us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
You can see the performance comparison there.
If the pumps are strong enough, the entire system can be operated.
If you have a large aquarium, you can use pumps with two or more outlets so that you can follow up several pumps.
The MK series has one, two or four doors, depending on the model Lüfterpumpe, but they also offer an option for adding an accent to the aquarium, for example with a hanging air vent (you can find it in our shop) or with a decor that transforms air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, a chest or something similar.
The MK series has a special, sealed construction that ensures low operating costs.
The installation is very easy.
The Lüfterpumpe is attached to an adapter with a diameter of 4/6 mm... and can already be used.
The Lüfterpumpe should be the same or higher than the water level and should be visible from the outside.
If the lulling pipe is deeper than the water level, one has to set up a suction vent.
Just cut the air pipe and set the vent.
This would prevent water running backwards through the pump, from the well...
If the loudspeaker is brought into the open, it should be covered and protected against fire
The pumps of the MK series are pure energy packages that consume little energy
Although we here at eBay provide the processing time with 3 days, the packages are packed and collected every day.
Everything is going well, it's very fast.
We just want to be prepared in case no one else is, just because it has taken a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for the entire staff who also work in the expedition field...of course, there is no Corona halt here.
Please do not rate it badly just because the delivery is delayed, which is only on the package services.
Man is naturally happy about these services, even if we are saying at the moment... they have it really hard
This is also very regional.
If you're not bad, stay healthy and we all hope for better times.
How long does it take to order the same thing with and without a coupon?
Can you also sell the bones in hell?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short flight into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the western US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally received the freshly cut astronauts after their return.
Welcome back, said Bezos, in a blue suit, when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers emerged and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were traveling at 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923- 1998), and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of the company, who paid for their tickets: aviation engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each person paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's short flight to the mission.
He had to work hard and do everything himself.
She was just released, said the 74-year-old with a smile.
Michael Strahan was also excited.
He would return to the All at the best of times, said the moderator.
New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometers
The "Raketensystem New Shepard" flies largely automatically.
During the flight from the rocket, the capsule reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, sometimes with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed from large parachutes again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers as the limit to the world, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third all-out Blue Origin flight: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old native.
In October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was there, who with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek" was world-renowned, as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy CEO of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of running the business with space tourism largely for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.
By pressing a button, you can unambiguously decide whether your "smart stone" should permanently glow in a certain color or whether its entire color palette should be displayed.
Switching to a different color, the light bulb emits a light color for around a minute before it softly transitions to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light is particularly impressive in the open air.
In a more remote area, its light is even particularly good - just to be expected when the days are getting shorter.
In the winter, you only have to ensure that no snow interferes with the solar module in its function.
»Smart Stone« uses a NiMh battery in the compact Mignon (»AA«) format, which is easy to charge when needed.
You can find the right bulb for your lamp on our website and thus increase the service life of your lamp.

You just need the tracking number at my mail?
Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry
I am studying biochemistry at the moment in the first semester and find the subject actually quite interesting and also in the laboratory I do not get stressed (I have already done the organic chemistry practical).
I had already informed myself about career prospects before the course, but at the time I also thought I wanted to study until I was promoted.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, particularly concerning my career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you always hear super job prospects and the job is totally sought after, on the other hand you always hear about unemployed biologists and unbelievably bad salaries.
I would really be interested in that:
What are you currently working on?
Are you satisfied with your work/ salary?
What have you studied/ What training have you made?
Do you want to do it again?
Many thanks for your answers!
I am currently quite uncertain and am considering dropping out of the course in 2022 and pursuing a career in information technology.

Extra stress before holidays and weekend
This topic came to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
Only now a post.
Not only before large holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our business.
As it seems, there will also be more brunch days.
It was so last week: Last week was Maria Himmelfahrt, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses do a brunch, which is semi-official.
Last week there was a long four-day weekend at home.
What happened last week?
Overall stress.
Larger emails, which had to be sent out before the long weekend, here is an order, there is an order, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Why?
Because "next week then" after so much time sounds and that is not allowed?
Or because people want to do everything in a compressed week as much as in a normal week?
I was not only stressed on Wednesday, but also extremely exhausted.
What is this self-isolation for?
So we have days off when we shouldn't be allowed to!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent of each other.
My question is simple. Are we just that, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed evangelical art?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld celebrates Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has not yet made any purchases.
The actress and singer Hit Radio FFH said: "The beauty, even if it should not bring snow in Erfurt, then one simply goes to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Wald."
She will settle down at the festival with her son Plätzchen, who plays.
I love it, said Catterfeld.
Until the necessary days, however, she still had a lot to do: "For the first time, I still have no gifts, I have to put them down now."

Still not working
DDR working model Altbau E- Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the Lok was in Schlesien and Central Germany in use, the very rare Lok is probably from the reconstruction of the model locomotive ME Heft 11/ 1968, used with traces and defects, function good, The E 95 track is a heavy freight train electromotor locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed to handle heavier coal trains on the Schlesian network, possibly originating from the small rail company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are working on it
The Deutsche Reichsbahn company had commissioned AEG in 1924 to design proposals for an electric locomotive that could propel 2,200 tonnes of freight and 530 tonnes of passengers at 45 km/h on this line.
The highest speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG specified the delivery as 1’Co+Co1’ Locomotive with Tatzlager-Antrieb AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves in the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany in November 1952.
In the renovation work on the federal railways in Dessau, the workload of all six locomotives was determined.
In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were converted to electric traction, and the other locomotives were used as spare parts.
At first, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 in larger numbers were preferred.
Only when approaching the E 94 was it possible to see that the number of working vehicles could not be increased any further.
At first, the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren freight depot.
They came to the Halle P. in 1960.
They were mainly used on a single route plan, from Kohlenzügen in the Geiseltal to Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives became problematic.
This often led to the use of shields during surgery.
Then the husband, who was travelling on this train, had to open the lock with a hammer and a screwdriver during the journey.
Damage to the locomotive engines usually came before and led to months of delays in the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, enough new locomotives were available, and there was no clear plan to expand the electrical network, so the Federal Railways were able to dispose of old locomotives and most of the splitter trains, so that the E 95 was put out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn Elektrolokomotiven only wanted to hire men, which would have caused a problem with the machines and the sighting of the locomotives due to the aforementioned difficulties.
After Mitte 1969 the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were closed, the E 95 01 followed them as the last, which quit service on October 5, 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was never used.
Until the E 95 02 all locomotives were transferred.
The E 95 02 was used as an alternative for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a weed barrier at the Halle main station.
It took some time before the responsible at the Federal Railways could convince themselves that the E 95 was a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive was first extensively modified with the aim of being able to present it as a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
Since then, the locomotive has belonged to the Transport Museum in Dresden as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive was completed.
The locomotive is being treated in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the maintenance of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new inner and outer coating, and the transformators were inspected and five locomotive engines were deemed operational.
The locomotives were on the Schlesische Gebirgsbahn until 1945 and on the adjacent sidings, where they defended themselves on the basis of their reliable operation and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945, the machines were transferred to the middle German network.
The main area was initially Schlesien
Handworking model H0 in OVP, good function, optical rework is required at the location in original work, built, with traces of play, Kellergeruch!!!, very rare handworking model, very small scale - possibly the scale is also from the small company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN

House fire with two light casualties and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in an apartment building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-storey Eurobereich was reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire had spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (district of Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were taken to the hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not take it from a possible arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it comes much later
And I still have to pay shipping costs
To counter fake news - Biontech CEO publishes impf photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first tattoo at the beginning of 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Until now, Biontech CEO Ugur Sahin has not publicly expressed his interest in the vaccine.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend had moved him, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin has published a photo showing him receiving an injection against the coronavirus.
There were false information on social media that I was not arrested.
In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network.
"Since a few months, my friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me where I look upset to counteract this false narrative."
Until now, he had rejected it because communication should not be about him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I heard that an old schoolmate is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not injured, Şahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
However, the most common cause seems to be fear, often caused by inaccurate information and lack of trust.
It is hard to fight against facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
In an interview with Deutsche Welle, Uğur Şahin says he is not guilty.
However, the video was released in December 2020, as well as Deutsche Welle itself.
At the time, Şahin said: "I am not allowed to get the poison myself."
In Germany, there is a priority in the arrest of the mother.
Meanwhile, the priority has been raised for a long time - and according to reliable sources, the head of Biontech has been punished three times.
Fire in power plant: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several districts in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday: no more electricity and, in many cases, no heating either.
One fire had caused a power outage.
After a fire at a power station with serious damage, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to survive without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday, through the fire at 41,000 affected residents and residents in several districts, the lichter escaped.
The Westnetz operator reported on Saturday that numerous storm aggregates had been in operation until the large-scale disturbance was finally lifted late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered jobs in schools and called for help from neighbouring countries.
The perpetrator thanked those affected for their patience and those who helped for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected communities, the district, the firefighters and the THW for their unremitting efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the Primärtechnik department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few days, as the Westnetz-Monteure were only able to restore some power supplies provisionally at first, he explained.
According to the company, a technical fault led to the fire.
Power flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at around 19.15 hours at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switching system.
There are necessary maintenance and repair works there.
To this end, a connection to a 30,000 volt power line was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is once again.
Since Saturday at 18 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had again received electricity.
Further 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were switched off at 21.30.
Since 23:15, the last affected power supply had also been restored.
Over 80 Westnetz and partner firms were deployed.
The authorities had also called on neighbouring countries to help with the evacuation of important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
It is now important that citizens take care of their neighbours and share information with local fire brigades when help is needed, said regional councillor Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The residents of Altenheimen in particular were in the focus when setting up and operating the Notstrom aggregates.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places in schools were set up for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed medical equipment dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the deck is sold in Germany.
Can I buy it for you and pay in euros?
It's the Daily Deck #PRS_ORG# in green.
I hope you have a nice day and stay healthy ♡
I can't mount it on the table.
It's a custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions.
We wanted those with a diameter of #NUMBER#
We have 155cm diameter.
Today, my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I cannot move it inwards and thus reduce it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy with a reminder
That's really easier!
Then we'll do it!
Send me the return receipt by mail?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not started the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find it almost unimaginable to have such a low guarantee.
We are not satisfied

In this way, the coloring task will be even and clean, you should clean the building materials with a little water, fat and finger fragments with clear water and remove them.
Before you bring the pin the first time with a new color to the model, it is recommended to use 2 to 3 stripes.
This can no longer be seen on the interior of the building or on a joghurt cup.
The first line on the building
Look at the pin in the same direction.
The slight overlap of the color layers later leads to a homogeneous area.
Keep moving forward and backward with the pin.
This leads to unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark could be seen later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come to the end with a separate pin.
Otherwise, it can come to unsightly metal shards if it mixes with normal colors.
Lasse the pieces for a day before you sell them.
The models achieve their original appearance through the decals or the removal pictures.
From aircraft to ships and cars, the decals give the model the last flight.
Bring the decals in the right order, as long as the building elements are still good to reach.
The cockpit of a plane can be lived in before it is built into the fuselage.
More important than the right tool, such as a chisel, a pin and a saw, is patience and a calm hand.
Take out all the needed decals one by one and put them down.
Decals are also called water pictures because you can see their backside with water until the carrier paper is darkened through the pores.
Then you just take a small piece of paper and put it on the corresponding place on the model (which you also marked before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you move the carrier paper away from you.
Warning: Always check that the image is in the correct position before you completely remove it from the paper so that it does not get stuck in your fingers, knit or tear.

Child abuse at PKV / What is an "Insurance case"?
Hello together
We were doing some child abuse for a while, but now when it comes to the settlement with the PKV, this suddenly comes up.
The series:
We had asked for the adoption of the children in advance of the PKV and received the promise of three trials.
The attempts were limited in some way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was recorded with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and carried out two (successful) attempts, but these did not lead to the PKV.
We again asked for the cost of admission at the PKV and received 3 more attempts.
After some further attempts (we have carried out more attempts than requested, logically the most difficult with the PKV) we sent the invoices to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2 + 3) the PKV only wants to perform 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/childbirth, the other two attempts of the first request failed.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to AGB, however, "the insurance event begins with the medical treatment, and ends when treatment is no longer required."
The questions to the experts in the round:
Who has the right to the PKV (only 3 attempts are allowed) or us (there are 5 attempts)?
* Did the PKV have to point out in the statements that with a birth the further attempts failed?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to blocked tubes) will not be healed by the first child.
It would be super if the experts would give their opinion here.
Many thanks for your help!
Can you please send me the three versions by email and tell me how I can get the best one?
In order.
We will no longer buy anything from them.
If you add the payments from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you obviously lost a good customer.
They can continue to do so with their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the refund was requested and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back.
I may not be able to do anything for the comforts to completely upset me
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote
It is clear and obvious that the refund was requested and I still have no refund by #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular hours.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment from his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect only emerged after a few months.
One chair must be used normally.
Otherwise, they cannot sell him as a chair.
The performance of 24 months is independent of this.
No, I am not able to produce another type of packaging.
I will remove the rank and put it at the disposal of the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are sold with additional hinges, but unfortunately we cannot find them for you.
Can you help?
The theme of the week: The best low budget films
There is no general definition of a low-budget film with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say about this:
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little or no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find a wealth of low-budget films on the Internet, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
Are you worried about it?
And what about you?
As a very good customer of yours, I have already set up two homes completely with your furniture.
Wanted the best price for the grey couch Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this also safe?
Many thanks
With friendly greetings
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing has changed in the waiting position...I will get back to it soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
Half victory against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
But the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees in Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Agency (epd).
The EU had not solved the confrontation, the researcher at the Berlin-based Science and Politics Foundation (SWP) explained.
This web state - Belarus is not quite small, but the EU feels like a winner - perhaps for a while longer.
The treatment of people on the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
It seems that there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not agree, this is at the expense of the fundamental rights.
This development also weakens the cohesion in the Union.
"She clearly cannot be deterred if a member state puts its head in the sand and refuses to do its thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which has not once allowed access to the border by the EU border agency Frontex.
In addition, the EU has another price to pay for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy will be reached, as the line " border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to information from Polish border guards, migrants have again tried to cross over to the Polish area via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested and deported to the border on Sunday, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were attacked by migrants with stones near the place of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
Overall, the border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had already breached the border.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or are attempting to do so.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko as the owner in Minsk of having lured them into the EU with the prospect of entry.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed border sections.
The EU imposed sanctions on Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners are stationed in the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving there.
The most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
The EU has thrown its market power into the wind and exposed its resolve with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also consider internal political costs.
The Belarusian company is probably not prepared to accept that the security apparatus regularly transports thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
Max Verstappen is said to have caused two rule violations during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has granted permission.
The silver spoons have two rule books in the last Grand Prix of the year.
Protests are aimed at a supposed error by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he was supposedly overtaken unfairly.
Another appeal was made at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes in the last race and was eager for his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which he had overtaken the cars travelling in the opposite lane.
I check it.
I speak to the bank and report to you again
Thank you for the support
Free entry for members: Europe Park hosts SC Freiburg Fantag
The Europa Park, named after the Europa Park stadium of the Sport Club Freiburg, has been invited to the SC Freiburg.
As the park announces, members and day tickets holders of the sports club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community are invited to visit the Europe park free of charge on this day.
In addition, there were free drinks and sausages.
On this day, the lower decks were illuminated by the tricolor.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white air balloons made the perfect curtain, the park said.
Since the beginning of the 90s, cooperation has already existed between the Bundesliga player and the Freizeitpark in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the European park, it has once again been shown how good the partnership is.
Seeing the glowing fans, who had fun together in the back, confirms that," says Europe Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is the €#NUMBER# and not 1699€?

Judith Hermann from her novel "Daheim"
In the context of the "LiteraTour Nord" literary tour, author Judith Hermann took place on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" and also acted as moderator.
She has been adopted, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds from her front door.
I sent out the contact form to return an article yesterday, but I didn't receive an email confirmation or anything like that.
My question would be whether my request has been accepted.
Not everyone has the time for your clipped chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you are trying to hide and not all from our budget.
Contact the woman #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We agreed yesterday that I would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a new order for the #PRS_ORG# night table and a return label.
This email has not yet arrived.

Tanning sale in Schönwolde: Women in the Krembz district search for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced so many bizarre situations at the slaughterhouse.
Once a man should even go home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year, he plants around 2000 plants.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many bizarre situations.
This makes Christmas time always a little fun, he says.
And with the voucher?
Otherwise, I'm a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now have to pay full price for it.
Then I'll evaluate that too!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their name.
On the German side, an equivalent might be the "Dreher", which does not sound so delicious at all.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass facade for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and had used Devolo DLan, which has received and sent 50 Mbit unrestricted to date.
The new glass fiber cable connects 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also come this.
However, the other DLan module, which is responsible for the WiFi, no longer sends out the full 500, but I continue to remove myself from the house with the module, so less comes to (I use a dose of 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms from the other module).
This means that the Internet is now even slower with the new glass fiber connection than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set that apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also large losses.
Can someone explain to me why with a glass fiber so much Internet speed is lost over the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to put LAN cables in the house.
I am really thrilled that I have created an account here.
Therefore, I would be more than happy with an answer.
When it's time to change the account
Anyone who thought that now there would be peace at the Giro accounts is mistaken.
While many banks have used autumn to confirm to their customers the fee increases of the past, the interest rates for negative deposits continue to fall.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, had a limit of 100,000 euros, which was considered relatively generous.
Now she has halved the free allowance and even turned it into a daily allowance.
In a first step, the border was only closed for customers of the group Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 euros in current and savings accounts and 25,000 euros in day-to-day accounts.
However, these lower dividends apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "novel agreements with individual customers."
The Commerzbank had previously reached a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced its bonuses in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
After all: More than 100 banks, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less.
The savings bank in Berlin has also reached an agreement at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance obtained legal protection against this regulation from the Berlin Regional Court.
Now, the banks are already discussing whether the institutes should set up provisions - in the event that the upper levels also consider negative interest rates to be unsustainable and have to pay back millions of bank customers.
The table for eight people was delivered instead of the one for six people.
The accommodation is for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a full beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is a mountain and a trail.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, this success is the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists and trainers is responsible for her appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she managed to get a chip on the day (yes, really, a single chip from the bag).
It is actually a miracle that their hearts are the same as those of the female and male fans.
Maybe because she just got lucky - and still wants the big love.
And the baby wants from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
People who asked about it have no idea what it is like for me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really injured.
I still hope that success and humility also bring happiness.
Unwarranted end of a career : Räikkönen must resign
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from the Formula 1 was even more quiet than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old finn put his hand up and winked at the crowd.
That was it.
After a lapse in concentration and a slight touch of the brakes, Raikkonen had to withdraw his Alfa Romeo at the start of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" concludes his career in the top class of motorsport.
His wife Minttu and the two children also accompanied him to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the World Championship in 2007 in Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix races, started 18 times from pole position and came to the podium 103 times. DPA
Friedrich holt 60. Weltcupsieg
The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen's record of 94 victories is the target of the Bob pilot.
I have calculated that I need to win four races a season to qualify for Cortina 2026, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the Winterberg races.
Only on Saturday did he defend the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundred meters, in which he ran from third place to first.
Then he changed something in the material setup and on Sunday drove 0.30 seconds faster.
With his team of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer  (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he defeated the Brit Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We took a greater risk today and were rewarded, said Friedrich, who also celebrated his 22nd victory in the series.
The Berchtesgaden native Johannes Lochner, who was travelling to Stuttgart, came fifth this time.
Christoph Hafer of BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race and eighth in the second race.
If I knew what he was doing, I would do it too, Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte took the third victory of the season in the women's singles on her way to the final.
After reaching the fourth place in Monobob on the previous day, she raced to the world cup victory on Sunday with Anschieberin Deborah Levi.
Two-time Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka of the BRC Thüringen came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt of Burghausen, in second place.
She recorded the first podium place this winter alongside her Olympic qualification.
The Wiesbaden native Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
It was supercool for me to be on the first Podestplatz in the World Cup, I am superhappy that Mariama took me on.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times were okay today," said Burghardt, stressing that "it is not just jumping, but there is a lot of work to be done."
Jamanka was a little irritated by the not entirely faultless driving, but said: "It is going in the right direction."
I already had the ceiling in the store and could now buy it!!!
What should I do?
I have not received him and therefore I cannot help but ask why.
Last year, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had committed suicide.
You can watch the chat about the Asare Sitzbank.
I want to give it back and then order it again, because it is reduced now:)
Why is the delivery only starting on 16 March?
There was no such long delivery time on your website
No, not until I get a field with the message
He was arrested yesterday by his colleague.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want to use the Regal module, just a new undamaged one
And not the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear ladies and girls and women
I have a lot I just want to write and maybe it's the one - or the other...
I am 24 years old, have KPTBS, full-time student and dog mum - apart from my dog not crying or going to the kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (since 6J) is sick, had a 2. grade on Monday and has been depressed for years (but now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we had a lot of hugs and it was nice.
I helped him clean up (because hand is in the association of burning).
He is getting colder and we are currently seeing less (1 to 2 times a week) of what makes me very happy with my use and love of Zune.
My dog's litter just had puppies, I had bred them and now they are in their crate and have become a bit more relaxed since I was holding the warm lamp and stroking for them.
I live alone with my sister and my mother and they are away for a month.
Now comes housework on us, which we naturally share.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is currently completely well, I am halfway well treated and come down.
Not bad, but I'm coming down and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university requires a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15 I have a written test for which I have made little progress and over the morning I have an anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare something.
Next week, I have a mental exam on Tuesday, and what then comes up in my calendar and not in my head because there is no place left.
My week is the same: Only until tomorrow morning, then it's weekend.
But is that all?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the holidays.
Only until the end of the week.
Only until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need those mental breaks because otherwise I would pack.
I feel guilty and "chaotic" somehow, but I can't do it...
Are you also so?
I am very grateful that I don't have to work.
I really can't thank you enough, I can't even put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my capture.
I believe that this has something to do with mental load of women and therefore I thought that I would be able to find some comfort here...
I wish you a pleasant evening anyway, the week is almost over!
I got my order today, unfortunately the whole other color plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has pressure.
The color was exactly as on the website.
We are very upset!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we get the table now, I'll get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26 December #NUMBER#.
In the other two.
But she was not confirmed.
Mal was completely different: I had decided at that time in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them like maths or geography.
For me, this always felt a little strange, maybe also because I was Christian and I always believed in something.
How are you doing?
Maybe you can also tell from colleagues at work and or studying.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is sensible to separate them.
Give me a lesson plan.
But it is just as strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in relativity theory.
Do you want to learn religion when you don't believe in it?
Is culture real or something else?
Hoffe asks not to be private.
Can it not be changed or not?
This is already very long, then I would look away
Is good, thank you.
I expect a response by the end of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Filmsuche Hilfe bitte
Hello people,
I am looking for a film from my childhood (I am 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
In the film there are two parallel worlds.
On the one hand, the modern world (real world).
The other the past (or the kingdom of the dead)(not quite sure).
In the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm so he can live.
The transition is also the grave site of the soldier.
At the end, the two soldiers fight each other.
If that is what you say, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has only slept on the bed since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive: D
Enjoy yourself.
So a child holds much more out than one thinks.
I am concerned that everything is going in the right direction, no chimpanzees, more often approaching and looking, but no minutes of observation.
That makes you think!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mothers.
No kiss.
We also had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when it is crying.
Is it turning around?
Is there something wrong with the roof?
Or is it facing the face directly in the mattress?
You can check if everything is in order.
We have also all grown up and when my husband came to the world, it was a big change and a big decision to put the kids to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customers" for you and have already bought a lot of articles
But why only offer me 20 euros?
Hello, I have already written to a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no reply.
It is about my Kleiderschrank, which arrived last (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right blade does not fit in the handle.
I would like to contact you as soon as possible.
The rank is currently not to be used.
To make it clear.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
All it is just that the politicians of this sender are now under all kinds of suspicion.
Fast every format is sponsored (ok), but then still go on a big bike tour at the same time.
It was said that it was an "independent" Internet sender.
Zitat Arno: Man wolle "keine laufende Litfaßsäule sein"
What is man now?
An 0815 advertiser who is trying to get his Billo merchandise to the elite fans.
And then we have Marah's Do's and Don'ts.
Of course, except for Simon and Etienne.
Of course, people can continue to complain.
One Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and is trying to make a profit from the action with the exploded rooms is trying to make an ashtray.
How to find all this?
If it pleases you, I find it harmful.
I am asking for a refund because my delivered table was defective.
Breakdown of the #PRS_ORG#.
As a pillow at bedtime or just to curl up – my little heat friend is versatile.
Cherry cakes are a traditional home remedy for sore throats, as cherries have a good effect on sore throats and can be dosed.
The removable inner cover can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The wide angle makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the small ones feel secure even if it doesn't work so well for them.
The Kirschkern-Kissen is suitable as a heat source for the following application areas:
Before the warming of the kiss, check for unusual smells, stock or fireflies and take immediate action.
Please take the inner sleeve out before heating!
In the micro-wave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (data from the microwave manufacturer!)
The heat is distributed evenly in the cushion after the rise!
After that, the inner sleeve was removed.
In the first stages, there may be a slight inflammation on the surface, but this disappears after repeated applications.
You should definitely follow the given advice, as prolonged exposure or higher energy output can lead to damage (fire and explosion risk!).
Check before an induction of the kissing in the microwell, that an induction of keratin products in the use instructions of the manufacturer is permitted.
After the warm blanket was put back in place, the temperature of the incubator was adjusted to suit babies (max. 43 ° C) on your arm.
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, in cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, fresh hematoma, blood clots and open wounds as well as in people with reduced pain sensitivity.
For existing skin, heart, venous, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, it is recommended to consult a doctor before application.
If you have open ears and loose bones, worry about the product and the loose bones immediately and unfit for children.
If the product is applied to babies under one year old, the temperature of the child should be regularly monitored during application to prevent overheating!
All incidents in connection with the product are to be reported to the manufacturer and the relevant authorities of the country in which the operator is located.
The contact is absorbable and at 30 ° C in the machine is washable.
Please note the care symbol on the product!
Second place in Darmstadt after Hinserie
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Hannover 96 is working from the bottom of the table.
For Ingolstadt, things are also not going well under the third coach.
Joy in Darmstadt after the late victory in the Sprint, happiness in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unfortunate start under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my network.
I bought this about five months ago, so it should still work.
I thought that network alone is sufficient for operation.
The battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the inserted network cable.
After that, I built the battery, but also here nothing happened.
Do you have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop online?
Is there anything else broken?
Many thanks for your help!
I want to deliver the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I do this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
The 20-liter tank also allows for larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be folded up with the help of the specially designed FlexFold.
And what you need for everyday items remains well organized thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The minimalist design has a lot to offer - with the Everyday Backpack Series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that securely protect the interior of the backpack and at the same time provide easy access to the camera equipment.
This works with two options: Once conventionally through the deck lid, which can be locked with the MagLatch closure system, a promising solution for effective protection that has already been mentioned in the Messenger bags.
In the lock, there is a lock from metal with suitable anchors on the front side of the backpack.
Unlike most rucksacks, Peak Design has taken into account various "filling conditions": there are four straps, stable, that can be locked into place.
If the backpack is full, just take the top shelf, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Clips and hooks are also magnetic.
The backpack can also be securely closed without having to fasten the straps.
The second option also differs from the Everyday Backpack in principle: In addition to the zipper, there is also an opening for a rain cover on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of common backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to struggle through the contents!
At the same time, this simple detail greatly increases the practicality of the bag: if you take not only your camera but also everyday items or a travel bag, for example.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (down below) and store the two problems neatly next to each other - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the right side of the bag from in front of the body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment while the day-to-day stuff stays in the left bag half and doesn't get in the way.
Beautiful, uncomplicated, tellable tragedies.
And since the outer pockets of the backpack are also made of 100 percent recycled, waterproof nylon, the content itself is then thin when going to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I was waiting for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday to confirm the transfer of
Contact has been made with the expedition to rescue the wrongly delivered fish.
Until now, I have not received any message.
I request immediate dismissal.
I have already written to the third support employee, but I did not receive any confirmation email.
It is the return of the wrong custom #NAME#
It is therefore worth looking at when the rank could be delivered again.
It is not an option for me to keep you...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
Wish you a beautiful evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will immediately make a larger order, but I will keep the damaged item and not send it back.
And I could not see that last year was different from what was expected, and I could not solve and clarify it in time.
But as a customer, I do not accept the damage.
Rotor brakes are designed for the claims of the dynamic driver, the safety and reliability of braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotor brakes are made from cast iron and then mechanically processed (bolted and riveted).
All the cuttings are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain species and cultivars.
On the basis of the individual technical drawings, a special production program is created, which is aimed at reproducing the characteristics of the original montage.
The steerable blades, which were designed in this way, ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
In addition, additional openings increase the efficiency of the cooling of the engine, while the clips improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic features of our popular cars underline their character through their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event changed the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered a bright rock in the water at the southern end of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news quickly spread and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and flowering towns in the country.
Roofs were collapsed, windows smashed, and saloons and hotels appeared almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was said, "Coloma or Bust!"
In this game you are a pioneer who is looking for a name in the West.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, combine horses and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to meet your pioneer colleagues to avoid going broke with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
At the same time, you choose your actions, have to keep track of their resources and build a table that works more and more for you (called "engine building").
The building allows you to become more efficient, receive additional actions or apply rules to your goals.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge platform, you can develop your individual playing style with finer adjustments.
Coloma played over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), to 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), and to 1850 (the year of California's official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players choose a location on the map where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates one half of the site - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving vehicles, setting up guards, searching for rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning revolver heroes.
If all actions are completed, the pioneers will return.
At the beginning of each round, the caller changes to a new location and changes the available actions.
This goes on for as long as the caller has moved five times, so he has covered one location once and the year ends.
There is a shooting range where players have to defend themselves against angry bandits.
If the players have provided enough revolvers and defeated the bandits, they receive bonuses.
However, if they fail, they receive smaller payments or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shot, then follows the final round.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I take up to 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm the shipping method, express (games folded).
In all other cases, DPD usually insures and with delivery tracking (games unfolded, cards folded and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also send you a card in a card for 2 euros, which has no pressure points at all.
Why children are not tyrants Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentation is now in my Twitter timeline, and I have looked at it.
The child psychologist Michael Winterhoff is often a guest in talk shows and holds lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he triggered a fierce educational debate.
Former patient: inside and educational rights now raise serious accusations against him.
Please pass on to you, the film is difficult to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
No parents or other responsible persons should ever be allowed to take power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child a free space for development and a framework for the child so large that it is suitable and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I still shiver.
Holetschek: Länder warn of test duty for three times
At their next meeting, the health ministers of the states want to decide on a national approach to the obligation to test for three times.
"We need clarity from our countries as soon as possible on and from when the test obligation can fall for three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, in the "Bild am Sonntag" newspaper.
Holetschek said that the case of 2G plus for three times a week is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive."
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that he will make a proposal to the Health Minister's Conference next Tuesday. − afp
I also want to send the lamp back
How do I get there best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I cannot see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't make any more purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Ups, there was an error.
Purchase over the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated the data.
What can this be?
What you describe as *awareness*, that is, sensory perception under full consciousness.
These occur with a frequency of ca. 1 to 1000.
The most common case is hearing screams or cries, less often seeing images, and the rarest is experiencing pain.
Relevant for this topic: Cuts are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as one avoids a very deep narcosis to protect the child until the incision is made.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned at the narcotics meeting.
Specific anesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) have a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT** Love all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but had **u/Nitemarex **per definition no.
Have their comment wrong.
But the chair is defective.
The 20 euros do not help either.
These are statutory guarantees.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take the defective chair back.
This is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you want to take the faulty chair back.
We then sell the second seat.
We also lose a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email that you did not respond to.
Still the question.
In the order and on the invoice, it says that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The sender is Company #NAME#.
I called there.
Man told me that they only deliver before the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order, because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture in the first stock.
Should I not call?
I had a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies at 97
He has become a theater critic and an administrator.
Later, he wrote a monumental theatrical history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle, 97, died.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly pressed: "A old man will get older."
The diary of a long farewell to the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle has led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the message that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I have already thanked my life here."
There are various types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standard wooden pallets that are mainly used as load carriers in the European region.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from the Austrian Statistics Office, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria every year is not revealed

Tips and Tricks
I had many great tips for the perfect gulasch here a week ago.
That was at Christmas and it was incredibly expensive and delicious!
Thank you again:)
Now I have come to the taste and want to bake the first cake for Christmas.
I will set up a fund for this tomorrow.
Do you have any tips for me?
Reminder: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going now?
What is with the books and how do I get them back to my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but that gets better

Where there are still Christmas brats in the room
For many people, Gans or Ente is part of the Christmas tree and the gifts.
Have you not yet secured a flight?
Now the time is almost up.
We promise you where to find a Christmas roast in the room Lübeck.
The "drive" of a high-pitched tone is important for the warmth and balance of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly matched by the valve reactor control.
With the volume, gain and master volume regulators, you can set the desired pitch and at the same time control your sound.
In the case of the VT+ series, the boosters offer a unique power level regulator that can be used to reduce the noise level without changing the gain or distortion.
Further up, it is already known that the POWER LEVEL-Regler can even make a performance reserve float when it comes to unpredictable loads.
Thanks to the power level regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The cup holders can also be used as a line exit.
The signal that follows will be processed with a box simulation, so that you will get an eminent "acoustic" ringing impression when using a headphone or when recording.
You can attach a CD or MP3 player to the auxiliary input jack so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
There is also a tuner function - you do not therefore need a separate microphone.
If you also invest in a VFS5 footswitch, which allows you to control the sounds easily by foot, the effect blocks can be switched on/off and the tempo of the corresponding effects can be adjusted.
This is actually unimportant for live performance.
With its new power package, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But that has not been the case with others.
Do you have the possibility to send the lamp back?
Is it too low for a meal?
I would also like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the commode?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, are you already on the #PRS_ORG# stage?
If it doesn't work, I would also be satisfied with a replacement or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need anymore.
I have already received my delivery and I would have liked to know if Schrauben were part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) at the specified location.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not passed
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreement
According to Iranian sources, progress was made in the negotiations on a renewal of the international nuclear agreement.
On Sunday, Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the news agency Irna that "the two sides are short of agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda."
This is a "positive and important development" because initially there was no unity over the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the resumption of the agreement were resumed after almost an hour of talks.
Participants in the negotiations include Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia.
An American delegation is also in Vienna on site, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen overtakes Sachsen - Free state now a federal state with the highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has defeated Saxony and currently has the highest infection rate in the country.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state to have more than 1,000 coronavirus cases on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always had the highest population in the country, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
Am Freitag und Samstag war die Einsatzerhebung in Thüringen geringfügig, hatte aber auch über den Wert von 1000 gelegen.
In Thuringia, 2242 new cases of Sars-CoV-2 and 16 more deaths related to the infection were reported within one day.
On Sunday, 200 people were treated intensively for Covid-19 in hospitals.
It can lead to complaints.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and hardly come up with new cases.
I understand that.
It may be possible until early March.
I have to write it down and put it in the package and give it to the post, right?
What do I have to do here?
That's what I want to avoid, so I'm writing to you.
I would like to ask for a refund at my own expense.
In my eyes, 8 euros is a relief.
It's time for changes
The Bundestag welcomes me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the post?
If you look at the activity of the Bundestag in recent months, you can make one conclusion: It is not existing.
We have arrived in a winter storm and have extended the summer hole for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what happened?
For the most part, this is simply linked to dissatisfaction, as here are some things that have failed and as we generally stand up for.
In recent days, the impression has grown that many here really still want to go to the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asking what it wants to keep alive.
The upload came from u/edizVEVO, who has become prominent on this project in recent days and has found a simple way to make a scrapbook.
After agreeing to write to each other, several people from the community found out that they had the desire to rebuild the project.
However, I would like to once again call on everyone to participate, so that this project can also have a future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server so that we can communicate with each other and work on concrete things.
You can access the server through this link.
Purpose:
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
What changes must be made / adapted / removed?
How should we behave in the future?
How should new members be invited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot something, but it wasn't bad, so at the end we had the Discord.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide on the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade for you so that it will be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too long/clumsy for my taste.
I have already ordered another one for you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the thin sheet.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the daily cover #PRS_ORG#, is there also in oversize, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty rank will be rectified.
And I ask you to leave now.
I did not have a suitable packaging, but I will try to mount it as far as possible for the disposal - they need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can always contact me by phone to arrange an appointment.
Is there a guide for the montage?
How long would it take me to worry about this and decide on the return?
How does she respond to the question of why she is vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague who I like.
She herself has been living a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, and is probably not eating meat at all now.
I was also a vegetarian for a few years.
When asked whether I always wanted to be vegan and whether veganism was a planned step, I had an honest answer without much thought.
But I have been thinking for a long time that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but eventually I realized and understood that I also support animal agriculture.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At the moment, I had the impression that she defended veganism and said she knew where her meat came from and how to reduce her animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I ask myself, was my answer to “plump”?
How does she answer the question?
Having the feeling that one is quickly pigeonholed as a vegan and that conflicts arise, without one being able to address them.
It greets a harmonious vegetarian (;
This is clearly not an exception to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not comply with the legal requirements for an extension.
I am at the appointed date, at which #PRS_ORG# does not accept my returns on site.
Since I cannot be at the site for a shooting, this cannot be changed unfortunately.
Can you please suggest an alternative date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I will be meeting again.
Lahnsteiner warf für Wasserrettung 45.000 Euro Zuschuss des Landes
Recently, the Rhineland Interior Minister Roger Lewentz handed over a subsidy of 45,000 euros to the Freiwilligen Feuerwehr Lahnstein at mayor Peter Labonte's request in the Lahnsteiner Rathaus.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounts to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatine supports us here, says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment truck is used by the crew of Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatine.
Over and under water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one is always facing increasing numbers: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the increasing use of the Danube as a leisure river.
I bought a book that I could only read to 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, when I followed their recommendations, the app crashed and had to be reloaded.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole operation has cost me a lot of time and now I'm hoping for help.
Okay, then.
I would like to order three articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter a date in the order process?

First of all, thanks for putting this whole thing together, I have also spent almost 10 years in state service in a similar activity, we were also armies in the executive, I will not go any further on that!
I always find the question of right and left very confusing.
In principle, however, one should say that the civil servant comes rather from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, it is also clear that people on the right of the political spectrum should magically align themselves with the conservatives in the particular uniform and weaponry, but it is also clear that these people will naturally be able to cope with the reality that has been imposed. Of course, it is also clear that many Germans with a migration background, women and even homosexuals (and now I am not referring to the overly feminized clique of women, for there are quite a few of them in the executive, by the way, but to normal men and women who are not mentioned when they are not counted) and also to these people I must and can leave my life, because in doubt they will save your life or take it away from you.
But these fringe groups also exist, even if it sounds funny to me after my experience of a more conservative approach, they are proud of Germany and feel rather less oppressed by a dominant left-wing politics, even if this politics is supposed to be aimed at them. They just want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the rights, of course, as the police and armed forces are also a section of the society. Extreme rights are also to be found there, but they should be allowed to express their views openly or even openly criticise any state-affirming plans that irritate me too.
Of course, police officers and soldiers, who were often deployed abroad, often paused because of negative experiences and also said things that were politically incorrect.
It is also coming to the fore that right-wing sympathizers meet up in a rainy exchange.
However, my opinion is still good, and also with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined that, to my mind, it would not be possible for us to have proper racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I did not understand, the other corb I also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it, it was not sold.
I already ordered in November.
But it was confirmed in my confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I have prepared with #NAME#.
Alternative, one could send the other #PRS_ORG# corb to Germany for #NUMBER# Euro in black, or is this corb in Germany somewhere obtainable.
I always only see you as a partner company.
However, there are two deep grooves on the edge of the wood part, which were filled with something
and on the mirror itself is a small knife
Ordinary by child?
Hello, Mich (w32) is already involved in a matter for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized on the job (I am self-sufficient, have very little free time), but even my life long I find it more difficult than right to maintain a healthy and orderly lifestyle.
There are always phases where everything is stable, and then and when it packs me up and I have to make room for it.
But it is never so "that someone could come spontaneously".
My husband (unfortunately) is not better either, it frustrates me somewhere but mostly just against work and frustration.
The kitchen is still regularly cleaned as we like to cook.
Now to my question, has she managed to become a mother?
We still have nothing but we are working on it and this question has been occupying me for a long time.
Because for me there is no incentive, it just doesn't feel so doll, as long as no visit comes and, for example, always fresh clothing is there and the kitchen is usable.
Is it better to have a child or stay single?
Thank you for your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a personality disorder?
I have a degree in software development and have been working for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am getting more and more the feeling that this job is not the right one for me, so I have been putting it off for a long time and studying social work again.
The problem: I have an insecure (or fearful) personality disorder (EPD).
This means that I do not have a self-esteem and accordingly I am shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a more personal level, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have already been told more often that I am unnerving (which I think I have gotten better at).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a streetworker or at an open youth event, but rather in, for example, the search for employment or family support.
I don't know if the actual working day really is like I imagine it, and it's difficult to find something on the Internet about it.
The AVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it drives me mad every time there is something wrong with my code ("the simplest things are the hardest to get right") and it is difficult for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should really know by now how this is done"/"I keep forgetting my questions about work"/"he needs to really keep me on track" etc.).
I probably have problems in every job but I wanted to mention it at the place.
But have you stopped the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation for this.
I am waiting for an appointment
What do you want me to give you back?
If I have a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message says I #PRS_ORG# authorised this book
Is there a problem?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a confirmation for my rank.
The bird digests the mealworm (protein) in its gizzard, which separates the individual mealworm components (amino acids) and builds up its own body tissues from these, which it also needs for growth.
The formation of the nestling and the moulting of the adult bird are extremely complex processes and are closely linked to the overall well-being of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio cannot be used during pregnancy, as it can cause disturbances in the fetal circulation.
In the context of this modest gift from NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (Multivitamin) and NEKTON-MSA (Mineral supplement) was to be resumed.

Statement of a municipal employee in support of the sentence
Hello r/ Legal Advice German
I have the following problem.
On our plot, a walnut tree will be planted.
Also filed a complaint with the district.
An employee writes to me that the case of the trees and the woodpile is not part of the presentation.
However, in the statement, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a vulnerable tree.
Can I now leave the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to leave an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the sentence is clear.
I thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for this.
I have no message
Naja, then I still have a sofo without use.
Can you offer me a memento or a voucher?
Was was so expensive?
Yes, I think, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and get the cover to Germany
Can you check it?
Eilmeldung: Severe traffic accident at Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St. 2179 between the Selb-Nord connection point and Plößberg.
According to the police press alert (14:03), a car crashed into the oncoming traffic.
There are injured.
Ah, okay.
Good, then many thanks again that it went so easily!
Rat and ideas for further career
First happy Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately good, because my head is just full of everything that one can think about.
Before I go now.. short: I need a vote and the best of people who know my situation - from you.
I am currently doing the Ref as a prerequisite.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked in a field there (at least a little anonymously, I call it nothing more precise).
But the whole thing was too long and I had to look for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I applied for a job with the school and was sure it was what it was - even though the framework conditions were much more restrictive than in my previous job, but that was me.
I am now at the third "I Google Other Stellenausschreibungen".
And it is only half a year.
In the past, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, then I could still adjust.
But I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
Now it's holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref, I always thought I would be stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my evening was also my evening.
I had free.
And the stress at work was equal at the moment.
Now it is too much stress for me to attend the family party.
And then there are these stark structures that make me nervous.
In essence, it is fun and, from the outside, the Ref is also doing well, which is good feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body is bearing before it completely breaks down - if it hasn't already.
I wonder if I want to have the rest of my working life like this - just when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should not go back to the old area, where I was valued, I could take free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow long-winded, but it was paid for and it was done together in a team, rather than as individual competitors like the case is now, which is most of the time.
But then I ask myself if I have not been to the same place in a year and if I am dissatisfied.
You see, it's all so weird, but maybe you have an opinion or ideas about how I can get out of this situation, which I am completely finished with and almost at the smallest thought about.
I am not going to make decisions now, that is likely to lead to nothing good.
But maybe your views will help me see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or Christmas, which is enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and apologies for my bad writing.
I hope my situation has become clearer at least.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has developed steadily, leading to the combination of progressive modeling technology with the "valve reactor" configuration, which perfectly simulates the behavior of a venturi.
With the VT20X, VT40X and VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely at the cutting edge of technology in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of building elements and circuit boards, the VTX boosters are equipped with an authentication that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also contain the more common Valvetronix preamplifier.
This is partly based on actual analog switches, because these are better able to pick up the sound variations and nuances of a speaker amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this, the VTX booster offers a completed house and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only spring.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct historical facts on the virtual level, and ignore them until the amp and effects sound like what you always expected.
In the first place, the perfect combination of sound and modeling technology is to be thanked for the 2001 presented VOX Valve Reactor technology.
She was subsequently modified several times to accommodate new sound requirements, which led to a performance upgrade to the VOX Valvetronix Series in 2010 - with more dynamism and numerous and significant improvements to the amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists will find a maximum sound variety here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamism of a pick-up: they expect a good sound, a nuanced response from the pick-up and a quick response.
During an ongoing analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that, above all, the end stages determine the noise character of a booster and developed the VOX valve reactor technology based on this finding.
Each of the VT+ amplifiers equipped with a 12AX7 valve reactor circuit forms the behaviour, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a valve amplifier perfectly.
NBA
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but victory against the Los Angeles Clippers is not enough.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main lens is also adaptable: with three individually adjustable focus and aperture parts, it is perfectly suited to your photo requirements and is suitable for any type of camera - from zoom systems of all sizes to full-frame mirrorless cameras.
If it finally fits in the bag, of course it depends on the size of the camera and the objective.
One possible compromise would be a DSLR camera with an interchangeable lens, two to three zoom lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for further objectives.
In addition, you can also customize any amount of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use the bag for your equipment and for photo-related things.
Drone pilots also have a good choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro, including a camera and accessories.
Vulkan eruption on La Palma: Longest in history
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
Until now, the outbreak of the Vulkans Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days has been the longest on the Atlantic island off the West coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous attacks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has eased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still do not know when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in millions
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the more than 1,000-degree-hot lava has almost destroyed 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, two new landings with a size of about 50 hectares have been created by eroded lava.
The banana plantation, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly badly affected, from which about half of the island's estimated 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly.
The newspaper "El País" wrote that 225 hectares of banana plantations had been destroyed and further areas heavily affected.
Christmas and gifts
Christmas is in front of the door and especially the children can hardly wait for the celestial festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have a certain affinity with the spiritual atmosphere and the gloomy tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional celebrations that still keep our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a kind of a "contract of civilised nature", which could obscure the stark routine and, in the context of this tradition, could be filled with life again.
How the Christ was born
It was the Protestants who were harshly punished, for which the Christmas stage was closely linked to the celebration.
Previously, gifts were exchanged on the Nikolaustag.
The background to this still popular site is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, had secretly thrown gold in their window to save them from another life in sin.
This unconventional way of concealing the contents led to the popular demand in Germany for the Stiefel, especially for filling children's bags.
Protesters clashed with this demand because they rejected intermediaries between God and the people as "holy protection."
For these reasons, they are against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christkind from the Nikolaus and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of the debate shifts to the evening.
Since most Protestants no longer see such details as so important, it is only the fewest who still complain that the need for the holy Nicholas is as important as the need for the Magi with their gifts and their sacrifices.
Today, one can find everything in Stiefeln in front of the Türe and under the Christmas tree of Socken to luxurious speakers, which the heart desires.
Various traditions in Christian countries
According to sources, a tradition of sealing has existed since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of mourning was transferred to the evening.
However, in all Christian countries there is a joyful hymn to the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christkind appears on the holy evening or the Weihnachtsmann, who in principle is a kind of Nikolaus, who over time acquired some characteristics.
This includes, for example, his white horse chestnut, which has only little in common with the rather strict Assyrian horse chestnut of the historical figure, his saddle, which will be rented, and the preference of the coachman to get access to the houses.
In the south, the holy Nicholas remains the central figure at the Christmas festival.
In Spain, the three holy kings give the gifts, while in Italy the queen Befana is said to have led them to Jesus.
In Scandinavia, Fabelwesen bringen zuweilen Geschenke, während es in Russland Väterchen Frost zu Einigem Ruhm brachte.
Here there are no pensioners, but three horses, who as a Troika pull his sled.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars, the Christkind is responsible for the transfer of gifts.

I asked for a refund last week and today morning for my order #NUMBER#.
I was told that I would be sent one.
Since I haven't received any yet (not in the SPAM folder either), I wanted to ask how long this usually takes.
Many thanks.
Police arrest suspected bank robbers near the royal palace
On Saturday, a police officer was shot near the Kensington Palace in London.
The police said that callers reported a man who had gone into a bank with a weapon and the business of a bookstore.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was later stopped by officers.
There were shots and the man was injured.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
Several protests have been staged in the area around Kensington Palace.
The Palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
What?
No matter where I click, I will be immediately redirected to your side.
The decorative lights fit harmoniously into every tree, garden area or lawn.
The light is simply turned on and can be angled with two floor screws.
Integrated and highly efficient 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in accumulator.
Max. 10 minutes
The robust power supply is always available in the outdoor area.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly dangerous objects from faraway galaxies that glow brightly.
Smart Stone, on the other hand, is completely harmless: Just the sun is responsible for the fascinating light display - either in white or in bright colours (in six different colour shades).
The empty, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a natural formation of large stones, this modern light object presents itself at day.
His organizational routines fit in with any natural environment - on the edge of the terrace, in the grass or in the stone bed.
He also makes a good impression in neighboring countries, where he can boast of his greatness.
You can save a lot of effort: As a solar light, Smart Stone requires neither control nor batteries.
Put the "light tower" on a popular, sunny square.
Two suspended beams provide support for a stable halt.
The matt white art material itself is robust and waterproof.
Its solar module »Smart Stone« is discreet in its inner part, together with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for bright light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the house.
If broken down, "Smart Stone" will start to glow; in which color, you decide: At the same time, six attractive light colors are available to you - next to daylight white.
The switch also happens automatically once the battery level falls to a preset minimum or gets too low.
As soon as the sun appears again, the loading cycle begins on the next day.
I've already done this several times and it doesn't work.
Shame, I would like to continue to order from you, but if the coupon is not counted, then I will not order from principle.
If you think differently, then give me a hint.
Otherwise, this was the last contact.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
In the lockdown, no tree market opened...
The motor control of the LokSound 5 was once again improved.
An adjustable variable PWM frequency of 10 kHz to 50 kHz is exactly what is needed for gunpowder motors – the typical “brummel” belongs to the past.
The application process can now also be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "autotune" function allows the automatic adjustment of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder also delivers enough juice up to 1.5 A for older motors.
Please use the eBay warehouse, so that the shipping costs are correctly calculated.
You receive an email with the package number for delivery tracking.
At every new equipment purchase, they receive a bill with clearly marked MWST from the contractor.

Pill problem
Hello love women
I hope I do everything right, after a year Reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I had started taking pills again about five years ago, mainly because I had so bad pain during the period and thought I had PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave this one alone, because I already have enough medication for chronic illnesses that I cannot take.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had about two years ago, during my last break, from 0 to 100 explosions, and this over all.
As far as I am concerned, this is quite superficial, but it has affected me very much and I do not feel well.
In the two years of pause, the whole has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips on how to avoid this.
My cosmetics are free of perfumes and fragrances, but maybe there is something I can recommend.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist did not take me seriously and the dermatologist is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who read the book!
The love for the skin is a matter of course.
Hate the acne, then get a bad case of neurodermatitis, then a period of calm, then widespread pimples and the acne issue.
I have also tried to eat as healthy as possible during the course of the disease, and have remained on a low-fat, dairy-free diet because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It can also be good that hormones are just the devil to get in the way, but if you want to go through all the construction sites like I do, you prefer not to search for anything else.
I had already seen everything from her colleague.
I wrote the conversation and now I have lost it and I don't know what was answered on my side.
I have to work on the phone and suddenly everything is gone...
What is there to check when the money is there?
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong

110 kV cable to be built in 2022
The approval for the transfer of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is right.
The government of Lower Bavaria's planning decision makes the way for construction free, which is to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network provider Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer long underground cable will connect the Tann cable in the north of the district and the existing 110-kilovolt power line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is attached to a mast near the town of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning
My order from 03-01-21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.
The blue bet slip number #PRS_ORG# with the transmission number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Play not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a configuration is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the next step is now?
A beautiful start in the week!
You can forget it, I have already explained it yesterday!!
This is a container made of glass and the entire sides are broken, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken
The commode is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come in because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the commode cannot be cleaned because no one in my apartment can
Thank you for the message
But why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is a problem with all books, so the request at #PRS_ORG#, because it is probably a general problem
Ref: Teaching plan (EK)
Hello colleagues and colleagues,
I have been in the Ref since the summer, which makes teaching me fun, but I have currently still major problems planning my lessons in the field of geography.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so I can only use the board, the textbook and an OHP as medium.
In the school, I can also only copy for free (which is expensive).
I just need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors, and for me it is actually every minute.
In principle, the methods also repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time in simple teaching hours (which I also need for UBs).
I actually always go from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) when planning and then outline how I can build it (mostly I just make an worksheet with texts from books my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore, the working hours.
Maybe I can get an earth science teacher to work efficiently with the book.
I would really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to keep the return as soon as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G regulation for Christmas.
In most shops, only those who are wearing masks or gloves can enter.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains about price increases.
He also suggested a possible solution.
The 2G rules, according to the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), reduce the important Christmas trade.
HDE head Stefan Genth criticised businesses with items of the non-essential need.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1,100 traders, more than 70 percent of companies looked negative on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already cancelled the Christmas business.
Genth said: "Now it often turns out to be the positive point of the year."
In the past week, retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-tax profits.
It is only in wholesale and online that things are going well.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with masks, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the head of operations.
He stressed that "2G does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic".
The current regulations frightened customers and required high personnel investment.
He demanded that the ban be imposed nationwide.
After that, every customer would have to be controlled only once on 2G (unlicensed or unlicensed) and would have access to all shops on this day.
In addition, in the case of individual sales - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (ticketed, sealed or tested) - samples should be collected.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies last had 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre- Corona level, with revenues at around 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of the so important Christmas trade," said Chief Executive Officer Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
As a result of the high personnel and administrative costs, the Center is trying to find solutions and obtain approval.
This includes the so-called bundchenlösung, in which "visitors to a central location in the center can obtain their 2G license and then - equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel - can enter all businesses." DPA
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The Mirror has a cracker and the inside is also a fault, which was tried to be cased with the same filling.
It looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already put it in the package and attached it.
What should I do for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high brightness.
For the setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with unique possibilities is used.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard temperature: daylight and artlight.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash storage.
One particular feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to use.
The light creates a very bright light beam with soft light of high quality, completely free of glitter.
The beam of 120 degrees with which you can see a large area at a relatively small distance is remarkable.
Also in reporting situations in small rooms or short segments.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a magnificent tool to work on both the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the remote control of the lights in television studios or when the lights are mounted at difficult locations.
At the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a light display.
The display shows the current brightness in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
The slot for the NP-F battery (not included in the delivery)
Storage The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To continue the settings of the individual settings on the storage plates, simply press and hold one of the storage plates for a longer period of time.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched on, so that when a new switch is made, the known situation is restored - very practically in studio work, for example, when the camera is set to a particular color temperature.
Battery-operated one of the largest strengths of the DL3120 The functionality of the device with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can take advantage of what is already there.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the accumulator has enough performance - it is a battery tester with built in - for each of the two battery chargers a value in the two display areas (the left accumulator upper advertisement, the right on the lower advertisement).
In addition, of course, it is possible to continue to maintain the laser beam over the networked part with power.
The construction of the lens is very simple.
They have a 16mm lens as an accessory, so they can shoot straight to their photo station.
The inclination is to make it safe by fixing it on both sides.
It was also noted that the mechanical components were extremely high quality and that, accordingly, they were also designed for longevity and demanding use.
In addition, there is a neighbour in the delivery area.
The package also contains a bag.
This allows you to transport or store the lights with all the accessories that you may still want to buy, without any problems.
Bad, I got it and it's too small: (
Party we wanted to smite: Frankfurt celebrates comeback against Leverkusen
Was for a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessen, who had won twice in a row in the league, appeared on the way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then the SGE turned it around, scoring within a good hour through a mature season start from the soul and winning furiously with 5-2. "It is mind-boggling what the boys did today," coach Oliver Glasner said on DAZN and spoke of a "holiday lob to every single one of them who was involved."
At first, it looked like a new fighter for the Frankfurt team, currently ranked ninth, behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had taken the Leverkusen with 2:0 in the lead.
What happened then, the SGE coach was also impressed.
Glasner continued: "Just like the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance."
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the field for the first time since the fourth match day and his torn muscle, also stressed the morale of his team mates.
I think our mentality is incredible, said the 27-year-old and was particularly pleased with the result for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the tasks that lie ahead, which is also good for the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that all players are fit in December and that all players are physically in a top league.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professional lives.
Now, one would like to "move forward step by step and remain cautious" and complete the tasks by the end of the year "at this level".
The next game is on Wednesday, during the English week, at Borussia Monchengladbach (18:30, Sky).
I get a grade for the mail because of a mistake.
I have tried to call and text #PRS_ORG# and there is no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me or do I have to wait for the money to be transferred back and the order to be renewed?
Unfortunately, I am not yet able to make a reservation because it has already taken a long time.
Are you already sitting on the #PRS_ORG# seats?
Defenders of women's handball against Spain in quarterfinal
After defeating Denmark, Germany's women's handball team clenched their fists and looked bored from the park.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection lost to 1632 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to run against hosts Spain in the quarter finals.
We were too eager and had too much respect for the opponent, said national coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main group III with 8:2 points as the second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's bad that we couldn't take the flow.
It was one of the worst games we had to deal with, captain Emily Bölk said.
In the fight for a place in the semi-final, against the 2019 World Champions on Tuesday, a clear improvement is required to keep the bitter dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German wrestler in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Alina Grijseels, who finished with six pins.
We were just not there - neither in the attack nor in the defense," said Xenia Smits, a backroom player, and demanded, "We have to look ahead now."
Not on the height
Unlike in the previous five tournaments, the German team was not at the height.
Luck and technical errors in the attack and the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 retreat after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at work temperature and prevented a few parades from getting worse.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
However, this was not the case.
The German women were hardly able to set a scene against the aggressive deck of the Danes - and when they did, they mostly struggled against the strong Althea Reinhardt in front of the Scandinavian women.
That was how the match ended at 3:10 a.m. after 20 minutes, when midfielder Mia Zschocke saw red for a hard foul on her opponent a little later.
In the quarterfinal, however, she can once again work.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get better into the game and by the break at least to five goals.
After seven minutes at 9:19, there was still only a slim chance of an escape.
Once again, the Green Guards were guilty in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal candidates at the final.
After that, the German team could no longer improve their performance and went as a clear loser from the park.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions in Christmas time
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we celebrated the Nikolaustag and took this as an opportunity to honour our family traditions in the run-up to Christmas, the Advent, Nikolaus, Heiligabend and the Weihnachtsfeiertag.

Does that apply to them?
The title suggests that I am working as an emergency doctor in mobile emergency teams, in which (so far) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered in care homes.
As soon as these are completed to a large extent, I will go to the part of the Impfzentren for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects as well as medical questions, provided they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, which is linked to the infection").
In my area of responsibility, the clarification for the imposition of the ban, the indication of the person (the person has a claim for an imposition of the ban on Corona infection and no grounds for this), the medical documentation and, in addition, the emergency response to allergic reactions (I have never experienced this).
The punishment itself is delegable to qualified personnel, for example medical specialists.
In Impfteams, however, we often have no choice but to use "only" (God's will no lack of appreciation!) pharmacologically technical assistants for the preparation of the infusion material, which, however, cannot induce an infusion (can it?), so that I can also perform most of the infusions myself there.
Serious "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "tyrant"?
With this dialect word, which was sent from an Amberger, a thought-provoking discussion was provoked in the BR television programme "Wir in Bayern".
However, unlike many other upcoming days, the concept remained in the series "host me?" this time from the guests.
No, it was not a "nervous person".
And no one has to "go quickly."
This, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
Where did the man from Amberg get the solution from and thus probably also alerted many superiors to irregularities.
The hooded man, seen by spectators as "the thief", is a lout with whom someone is wrestling.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, from Bavarian TV for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the comment that this is a typical term from the Upper Palatine dialect, which is somehow related to the rather well-known word "Houdern".
What was closed was a gap in education - probably also for some of those who have been living in the area of Amberg for a long time.
I can't buy books for two weeks.
After confirming the next error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# with the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Reifenwahl bei Rennrad - wirklich so pannensicher?
Today morning I woke up with a lot of motivation because I wanted to prepare my bike tour in the coming week.
I mean, I did it and I rode my bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40 km were also really nice - but then it happened what in every town centre (this time: Thank you Krefeld!)
Glass splitter on the line.
Zack, who seems to be grinning, wanted to keep the rest of the line on no account.
Since I had no real chance to worry about a replacement mantel and a replacement roof because of the weekday, I had to turn around and take the best train home with a bad halfway.
War then also technically not so bad, maybe it is even better when I practice again before the cycling tour with the gear change.
Now I am facing a question and hope that it can help me.
Since I have a relatively long line of sight over several days, I would often get this problem.
Now it was not really bad, because the old tyres of the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had ridden his bike 120 km on the day I took the bike out of the garage!) were also described as suboptimal, because he had ridden his bike with them for many years.
But if I think about it while driving at 80-90 km/h, I still have to make a gear change, then I'm really bad at it:D
Now I'm talking to an older man on the train, who asked why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they should be flat.
Now the whole sounds very natural.
But are these really so uncapable?
I have little interest now in giving 40 euros/car, just to then be disappointed.
I continue to ask: I think I have 25x622 at the moment.
There are also (apparently?) marathon plus tires, but the bulk is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or is it just a way for her to get to me at a race track?
The rubber side seems to be my absolute! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you for your help and love!

After the publication of our new high-end broadcaster B 100- 6 OHM, there was only one question of time before our SOLO series would also receive successors.
SOLO 15 is the new spark plug and reminds optically of the large previews with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this design, a suitable foot is directly in contact with the speaker to move the speaker to the correct position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted to the length accordingly.
The SOLO 15 is very suitable for people, for whom the maximum sound level plays a rather subordinate role, but a rather unusual high level is to be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker simply cannot generate such a large sound pressure.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 is bad.
On the contrary, they are noticeably grown-up and for their size extremely impressive and accurate.
Tonal voted for the SOLO 15 with a slight high tone.
This is usually done by increasing the frequency of the bundle.
Almost on the spot, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and powerful sound.
The high-altitude area can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the sound source, the positioning of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is precise and harmonious.
The suspected extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM cause a hostile dynamic that its own seeks.
The SOLO 15 adds not only to our SOLO series, but also expands this in terms of resolution and accuracy.
At the beginning, it is recommended to think about the final optical design of the speaker to make corresponding changes in the construction.
If you want to furnish the house, the speaker needs to be adjusted accordingly, as the furnace is still contributing material.
After all the plates were connected (e.g. in the tree market), it was necessary to first bore an 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the corresponding place, so that the cable could be passed through easily later.
With the help of an overhang, the speaker opening in the front follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
This opening should be seen with a 45-degree phase to create a large opening for the speaker cabinet in the inner part.
The four soldering points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive a connection in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On these, the return, the deck, the front and the floor are now installed.
The three tunnels should also be used and connected.
The fittings themselves can vary in material strength if, for example, you want to take advantage of finished goods from the wood market instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be considered.
Then follow all the plates of the shoe, that is, the two sides and the front.
With a suitable length of cable or a forest ranger, it is easier to get the bass reflex openings and the connecting cable on the back wall.
After that, a round frame is used to cover all the corners of the actual box.
The top of the shoe plate can also be adjusted.
At the end, the floor plate is fixed to the floor of the house with long wooden screws.
Next, the markers and incisions (2.5-mm incisions) are made at the points of fixation of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection clamps.
After the house of wood was cleaned (removed / removed), the next step is to remove the cable.
This is achieved by the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and uncrimped cable is then passed through the 8 mm bore in the floor to the terminal opening and allowed to rise 30 cm.
In the upper part of the building, the cable leads to the speaker opening and can also be locked there.
Next, the frequency is prepared and used.
The frequency plan and the corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document: Montage Anleitung Weiche Solo 15
If the frequency is built and the termination terminal is buried, the 8 mm cable opening in the inner box is disconnected, which is still not completely sealed.
With the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and a little trick, you can move the hot shoe to the opening and close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the discharge accordingly.
Now follows the attack according to the description.
After that, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and fixed with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus lead (marked cable) at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact) must be activated.
At the end, the bass reflex horn is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the cable) and sealed.
For the fight, a mat of the fighting material is divided into two parts and locked in the house.
The opening of the bass reflex channel should be allowed.
Can I make an order now and only deliver it at the beginning of June?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will also hold the OSCAST this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and a shorter announcement period.
ABER There will be at least three people per screen, so we can follow the Oscars 2021 with at least seven bucks in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - we're still going to do everything we can to make the Oscars as safe as possible.
It will take about 0:30.
If you already have drinks cold, plan a good meal and make you ready for a long but very interesting night.
