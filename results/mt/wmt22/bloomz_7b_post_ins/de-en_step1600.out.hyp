The goods cost under 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the product value....
I am #PRS_ORG# and therefore it is not a problem for me.
I only need a number or an instruction, so that I can track the package for you as a return.
I bought the #PRS_ORG# a couple of days ago... for 249 euros.
It costs 179 euros today.
I find it very annoying honestly.
Should I cancel my order and order again for the better price or is there another way of signing up?
I also think that children should not be expected to take on an adult role for their little siblings.
However, I find that it is also good to take care of small things in moderation.
Quickly look, quickly help, quickly bring the bottle etc.
They learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can take care of themselves, I see no problem.
If your kid is busy for a while and it's okay for him, that's great.
You can best judge for your children.
It is not so that he is going to curl up in a K2 and sleep for hours.
It is likely that it is illegal.
Maybe that's why the psychologist's statement came out.
Because if something were to actually happen like a fire, an earthquake, an eruption, an alien invasion etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1, to worry about K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is up to you;)
Could you please help me find the title of a book?
I remember reading a few years ago a crime/thriller and although I can still remember almost the entire plot, the title does not want to come to me... maybe someone knows...
The story was about fear and how to deal with it.
At the beginning of the story, a dog walker takes his own life by jumping overboard and drowning.
The case is being investigated by a commission, and a clinic where the doctor worked has been ordered to cease operations.
The commissioner has a small dog that also has fear (of fire) and has landed with this therapist.
It leads to more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer is commissioned to go to the site of each suicide and document it and put the photos online.
In the end, it turns out that this therapy is a type of groundbreaking therapy, where patients are implanted with a chip in their brain, which suppresses the centre of fear in their brain and ultimately allows patients to control their fear to an extreme degree.
(A woman jumps out of the window and drives herself to death)
This is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic where the fire was started.
That is the gross action I am quite sure that the book was plagiarized by a French author/author.
If this action is known to anyone or even if someone would dare to suggest the title of the book to me, I would be very pleased.
Oh, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I need to contact my husband.
But that can take time.
What steps should I take next?
Is it also possible to prove the price difference?
Kind, 4 j., Splitter under the Daumennagel
Kind, four years old, has been climbing over the entire length of the wooden barrier (side).
He tried to pull him with a pin.
Very difficult to grasp.
Not even close and done.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try it.
No more chances.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining a digital decoder and sound module on a single disc, we are able to achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm, and can therefore be installed in almost any lock of the groove H0 and 0.
The LokSound 5 decoder is available with all common connections and always comes with a 11x15mm thick "plug" sound output.
Like all family members, the LokSound 5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It supports the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are as easy to understand as two- and four-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoder automatically connects to a suitable digital central station.
He commands all DCC programmed locomotives and thanks to RailCom® the CV values can be read out of the locomotive with suitable central units.
For central controls that can only program the codes from 1 to 255 there is a help register.
Motorola® customers benefit from up to 28 levels at 255 addresses.
Three other Motorola addresses allow the solution of 16 functions.
An incorporated programming mode makes it also possible to reprogram the trustworthy control unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration to mfx® compatible central stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognises Märklin® brake lines as well as ZIMO® HLU brake lines or the Lenz® ABC system.
The brake with DCC brake cables or with counterweight is also possible.
In addition, he also uses a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC elevator allows automatic transportation between two floors.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used for analog sound signals.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to hold a referendum
New cases of Omikron concern politicians and scientists in Great Britain.
This is why all qualifying adults in England should receive an invitation by next year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to take a more proactive approach to coronavirus testing as the number of cases increases rapidly.
Every adult in England should already have had the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, if they have not had a second dose at least three months ago, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
The target date has so far been set at the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to speed up the campaign in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the case of the Omikron variant, a contingency plan is in place, for which urgent action must be taken to strengthen infection control, Johnson said.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased with a third dose.
Let us now boostern! said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more omicron cases were registered in Great Britain, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was a rise of 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be reimbursed at the time of cancellation?
I am for everyone to use pronouns
I sent an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to respond to the email.
But unfortunately the name is not "Peter", but something more complicated.
I seduced him and after he had a cultural background, it was either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write an email now.
Could you please help me?
** I am an alien and do not want to interfere with the authorities.
Conclusion: everyone should use pronouns.
I have written a total of 5 books.
Four of them went.
I only bought that today
Obviously, the chair had a lack of appeal for sale.
How can a police shooting happen after 9 months?
Only on #PRS_ORG#.
This has been working for about.
No more for 14 days.
So I have always bought the last books online and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are back and I want you to add two more seats to the order and have them in my account.
(CW) The feeling when I can't help it.
Content warning: I will write something detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something from the heart.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
There is a theme that really nags at me and unfortunately often happens, that many victims cannot help themselves or we could not help them.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything about it.
I see the blue dots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation with four eyes, with the perpetrator, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of regret, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of exposing the children to this.
I always want to make things clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, but everyone can live without violence.
I want women to know that they don't have to take it easy.
I often wish I could help... I know I can't.
But it will never be easy.
Please always remember that it is worth living without violence, and that is so unbelievably important.
Arcane on Netflix: What is the series about League of Legends?
Much fantasy, many complicated names, a mind-boggling setup: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently premiered on Netflix.
Why are we happy about the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby between MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg and Merlins Crailsheim
At least on young Johannes Patrick.
Nothing new: The eldest in Crailsheim lost it for a second time - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had spoken about the cup defeat at the beginning of October at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have something to prove."
After the game, however, the team did not settle down - instead, they fought back to the 61 - 72 (28 - 38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
More than the naked result, however, the way it was achieved disappointed.
The term "statistic" is a euphemism for the entire dilemma. The three-point conversion rate was exactly 13 percent, with four points (all by young Johannes Patrick) and 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was given by John Patrick: "We were not focused enough after the victory at Teneriffa and we did not implement what we had trained."
To move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted differently: "A friendly game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like there were 10,000 people there."
Only 750 spectators were allowed into the high-security arena on Saturday, but they were worth it.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team to victory.
The best coach I have ever had, praised Gleim.
While Patrick's teammates all failed to score, including Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7).
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the leaders prevent a total debacle and come back to eight points after they had already lost 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Unfortunately, there is no time to waste.
On Wednesday (19.00), the Riesen will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before also performing in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.
We had another email address before, but I changed it.
Yes, I reported it a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all claims for compensation were rejected.
We have informed them again in writing and have therefore again appealed to them.
We had already announced this half a year ago.
Always like painted: Max Raabe will be 59
He wants to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
At the moment he is on tour with the programme "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he will actually appear.
Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig on Sunday.
But there is nothing to it.
The concert was scheduled to take place in May 2022, but was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Even other engagements he had planned for the Advent season have to be put on hold, as stated on the singer's website, which says he will be 59 this year.
From January, the artists want to collect their 2020 terms, which were postponed due to the pandemic.
Max Raabe was born on 12 December 1962 in the north Rhine-Westphalia town of Lünen. As a teenager, he already sang a lot and very well.
In 1986, he studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1987, together with his comrades, he founded the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and songs in the style of comedian harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached exactly the same place in the charts as his successful album "For women this is not a problem" (2013).
He managed to get it into the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, with her blonde hair neatly parted and her attention to detail, Max Raabe is no longer far away from the current German-speaking music scene.
He has been touring with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" since 2020. dpa

Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: By renting out, no new homes are being built
The new Federal Minister of the Environment, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the eviction of large apartment complexes, as has been demanded in a popular vote in Berlin.
With a change of ownership, there is not one single new apartment, but only a change in the ownership structure, said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sonntag).
My goal is to provide tenants with security that their rent will remain payable in the coming years.
An eye-catching mix of private landlords, tenants or housing associations is also the best protection against a Monopol image.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left parties wants to set up an expert commission to deal with the result of the people's vote.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz has not ruled out talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition on further tightening up the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price cap until 2029, limits increases in rent in competitive housing markets and extends the rental cap.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not improve despite that, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to make a purchase a few days ago but I forgot the last step in the payment process.

At least 100 dead in tornadoes in Kentucky
Many tornadoes have hit the United States.
More than 100 people could be killed in Kentucky alone.
The pictures remind us of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes struck the USA, causing severe destruction and possibly as many as one hundred fatalities.
The storms leave a layer of about 320 kilometers of snow, especially in the state of Kentucky.
After visiting the disaster area, Governor Andy Beshear said that everything there was in order.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just out.
Some parts of industrial machinery have fallen into the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible at all.
He estimates that as many as a hundred people have died in the state of Kentucky alone, official figures are much higher.
Hello, I just saw that the #NAME# is on sale.
That is very bad.
Will it still be produced?
Or is she completely out of the selection?
Is it possible to order this display in another country?
When do you want to report?
If the delivery cannot take place in my home, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but I can only order it now and send it to Germany, what's in the cart?
I had sent back the contact form and requested a refund, since I had not received confirmation yet.
Companies pay penalties and change advertisements
While the federal government is still considering proposals for a surcharge, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees money to be vaccinated.
With this, they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives to be imposed.
The modification of advertisements to call for donations - following the example of Germany - is also intended to increase the readiness for coronavirus donations.
He has been transferred to another company.
This makes his situation worse than yours.
Drinks and tea.
It's a year ago.
He did not shy away from candidly talking about his old position and has been looking for other things.
You can do that too.
And that he did not like at the time: no matter.
He didn't find his job very good either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be quite relevant.
I took a screen shot.
Good morning - I have an interest in the Boone table, white.
Does it also come in 230 cm?

Help with first own campaign
Boron at a discount!
I am currently leading a group of 4 friends on a hike through the Green Pass and want to immerse my heroes in a campaign specifically written for players.
We play DSA 5.
The bulk of the book is made up of the diaries and their motives, the individual acts put together and now I am in the process of writing the first entry about my own journey.
The premise is that the heroes are to drive a lorry with hay from Gratenfels in a small village near the Thuran Sea.
Further action is to be taken there.
Some miles from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to be waiting for the heroes, and they are supposed to lock them in a dungeon.
I would like to give the players the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: by proving their innocence, by taking action, by being threatened or by realising the danger at an early stage, which also affects the players.
Group strength: 8 common goblin, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and arrows
If they do not notice, the goblin army moves the heroes in a straight line and flanks them on three sides, while two with spears stop the chariot.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
The heroes are discovered and welcomed by the son of the village headteacher, a half-elf.
The car is naturally missing.
If a defeat is unavoidable, then this half-back will use two of his feet and come to the aid of the heroes in the battle.
The car is still there, everything is super.
How does Deus ex Machina solve problem 2?
Is the encounter too much for adventure?
The goblin group will later play a decisive role, so it's not just cannon fodder.
EDIT Wow, I hadn't counted on so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely listen to your ideas and now I also have more confidence in my narrative.
I have once again dismantled the lamp.
And again together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
I would still like to send her back
Then you can get the backlash, and then I can pack up the lamp and take it to #PRS_ORG#.

I am excited about Sky Sport F1
Hello F1 fans, the quality of the German Sky has been taken a lot more down this season, so I want to make a little air with this post.
For the first time this year, the transfer was broken off in the middle of the F 2 race to start the F1 previews in time.
Although the postponed start and the starting accident were far behind schedule, you could still show the last ten minutes (of the planned) and the championship decision!
It seems, however, that for legal reasons the F1 has priority and therefore has to restrict itself to everything else, so that Sky DE had no choice but to come here.
Despite that, Sky UK has managed to carry on the race.
Nevertheless, a small praise: The commentator Olivier Zwartyes has handled the tricky situation regarding the serious accident well.
Then there was rule knowledge in the F1 commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both unaware that you can change gears under a red flag.
Although this situation has already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, it was only at the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change the tires, when appropriate questions were asked of Hamilton on this topic.
Both Sky UK and RTL commentators knew immediately that it was possible for Verstappen.
In my opinion, such fundamental rules should simply be known when one is commentating on the F1 on a pay TV channel.
It is not the first time this has happened, which is now according to the rules possible or even prescribed, but there are simply constant uncertainties in the area of the rules.
In general, I don't like the commentary style of Roos, but there you have it.
But I seriously prefer Heiko Wasser of RTL.
This is further complicated by constant interruptions, which are just as amateurish, such as the ordering of coffee by ( equally amateurish ) reporter Peter Hardenacke or " UuuuuHD " by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the last one brings a lot of unrest in the comments, which he does not seem to take seriously.
Not least because advertising on Sky is easy, and Sky is the only broadcaster who advertises, like you can follow F1TV with the German commentary right after the race.
Weder ServusTV noch ORF tun das.
Even these two channels make less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
It is true that one should praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that does not make it any easier for me to see the negative side.
The other F1 program on Sky Sport is also very strong and full of repetitions.
In total, Sky is really the worst German channel that covers F1.
Unfairly, RTL is being forced to do a better job in the four races it is still allowed to compete in.
Anyway, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a normal channel.
I would like to hear your opinion.
Here is the message: #PRS_ORG# - Pendlebury, Messing and more colorful glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me on Monday that the second lady told me yesterday that she was going to send an email and she never did.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG#s on 12.12.19.
One of them already has a defect after a relatively short time (the material has a hole in the upper part of the seat).
I need support.
Lüfter pumps are specially designed to provide an aquarium with additional carbon dioxide.
It is also possible to use a filter system over the air.
This series is offered in 3 versions by us.
Check the table at the end of the offer.
You can see the performance comparison there.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, you can use pumps with two or more outlets so that you can follow up several pumps.
The MK series has one, two or four lanes, depending on the model of Lüfterpumpe. However, these can also be adapted to set off an accent in the aquarium, for example with a ceiling fan (available in our shop) or with a decor which changes the air pressure.
Here would be a treasure, a shell or something similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-proof construction and ensures low operating costs.
The installation is very easy.
The lubricant is attached to the endoscope via a hose 4/6 mm... and can already be removed.
The spray should be as loud or louder than the water sound and should be visible from the outside.
If the lousy air pressure is to be believed, one should put on a backbreaking ventilator.
Just cut the power cable and set the ventilation.
This would prevent water running backwards through the pump and into the well...
If the luggage is carried in the open, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other luggage
The pumps of the MK series are pure energy packages that use little energy
Even if we indicate the processing time with 3 days on ebay, the packages are packed and collected daily.
Everything is running smoothly, it is very fast.
We just want to give people a heads up so they don't freak out, just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the racing world... of course, there is no Corona here.
Please do not judge it as bad just because the delivery is delayed, that is only down to the postal services.
Of course one is happy to use these services, even if we are saying at the moment... they have it really hard
This is also very regional.
If you're not bad, stay healthy and we all hope for better times.
How long does it take to order with and without a credit card?
Can you also buy the eyes in hell here?
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos sends astronaut daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first US citizen aboard, a TV host, and four other passengers took a short flight into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos company Blue Origin.
The ten-minute flight took off from the west state of Texas.
Amidst the bright blue sky, Bezos greeted the freshly qualified astronauts after their return.
Welcome back, said Bezos, in a blue suit, when he opened the Luke's case.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually emerged and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were traveling at ten minutes and thirteen seconds per second and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 1974-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923- 1998), after the racket system of Blue Origin was named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were guests of the company that paid the other four passengers for their tickets: aviation engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each ticket cost.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's short flight to the mission.
He had to work hard and do everything himself.
She just flew in, said the 74-year-old with a smile.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to return to racing as soon as possible, the moderator said.
New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometers high
The racket system "New Shepard" flies largely automatically.
The capsule, which was torn apart by the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, sometimes with great speed, before the reusable object broke apart from large parachutes.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers to be the limit of the Earth's atmosphere, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third all-out Blue Origin flight: In July, Amazon founder Bezos and his brother, a 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman, were on board.
In October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was there, who became famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy CEO of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the business with the space tourism far beyond any scientific research interests for the benefit of mankind and disregarding the climate.

At the moment I am studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject itself quite exciting and also in the laboratory I do not get dizzy (I have already had an organic chemistry practical).
Of course, I had already been informed before the course about career prospects, but at the time I also thought I would definitely want to study for my promotion.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially about my professional prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you always hear super job prospects and the job is totally sought after, on the other hand you always hear about unemployed biologists and unbelievably bad paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested in:
What are you doing at the moment?
Are you satisfied with your work/ salary?
What did you study/ What kind of education did you have?
Do you want to do it again?
Many thanks for your answers!
I am currently quite uncertain and am considering dropping out of the course in 2022 and enrolling in a specialization in computer science.
If she has any experience, she also wants to write about it:)
Extra stress before holidays and weekend
This issue came up last week with me.
But now I had to use my long weekend to unwind.
That's all for now.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our business.
As it seems, there will also be more brunches on weekends.
It was just like that. Last week, Maria Himmelfahrt was harvested, which is called "harvest" in our country in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses do a brunch, which is semi-official.
Last week there was a long 4-day weekend at home.
What happened last week?
Overall stress.
Larger emails, which had to be sent out immediately, were sent out here, an order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Why... why?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time has passed and that's not right?
Or because people all want to do as much in a compressed week as they normally would?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also exhausted.
What is the secret behind these celebrations?
So why do we have holidays if we can't have fun?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent of each other.
My question is simply: Are we alone, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed evangelical style?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld celebrates Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is excited about Christmas in her Thuringian home - but has not yet made any purchases.
The actress and singer, Hit Radio FFH, said: "The beauty, even if it should be snowing in Erfurt, one simply goes to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Forest."
She'll settle in for the festive season by cooking and baking with her son.
I love it, said Catterfeld.
But until the innocent days, she has a lot to do. "For the first time I have no gifts, I have to put them down now."

Still not working
The diesel locomotive Altbau E- Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was used in Schleswig and Mecklenburg in service, and the very rare locomotive is most likely the result of the construction waste of the ME Heft 11/ 1968 locomotive, in good working order, The E 95 is a heavy freight locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), designed to carry heavier coal trains on the Schleswig network, possibly originating from the small company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
An locomotive is on display in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and is fully operational
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR) commissioned AEG to suggest specifications for an electric locomotive that could propel 2,200 tonnes of freight and 530 tonnes of passengers at 45 km/h on this line.
The highest speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG specified the delivery as 1’Co+Co1’ Locomotive with Tatzlager traction AEG, with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
The delivery of six locomotives, which received the numbers E 95 01–06, took place from December 1927 to June 1928.
They all survived the Second World War and were reunited in the territory of the then GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were repaired and returned to the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
At the Dessau Railway Improvement Works, all six locomotives were fitted with new engines.
In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01, E 95 02 and E 95 03 were renovated, with the other locomotives being used as spare parts.
First of all, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are in larger numbers, were preferred.
It was only when driving on the E 94 that the work number could not be increased any further that the E 95 came into focus for work.
First, the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren train yard.
They came to the Halle P. in 1960.
They were used on a main road between Kohlenzwerg and Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic.
This often led to the use of excessive force by police during raids.
Then the engineer had to use a hammer and chisel to remove the lock while the train was in motion.
Damage to the locomotive engines came mostly before and led to months of delays in the locomotive.
As at the end of the 1960's, when sufficient new locomotives were available, and when there had not yet been time to plan for a significant expansion of the electrical system, the Federal Railways were able to dismantle the old locomotives and most of the track ballast, so that the E 95 was put out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn Elektrolokomotiven only wanted to employ men for their diesel locomotives, which would have caused a problem due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's seat.
After the E 9502 and E 9502 had been withdrawn in the middle of 1969, the E 9501 followed in October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives were transferred to the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was displayed as an alternative to the museum locomotive E 77 10 at Halle railway station.
It took a while for those in charge at the Federal Railways to convince themselves that the E 95 was a worthwhile museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive was initially prepared for display as a vehicle in the RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has been designated as a non-operational museum locomotive by the Transport Museum in Dresden.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive was completed.
The locomotive is being treated in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the maintenance of locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new inner and outer decoration, and the transformers were checked and five locomotive engines were found to be operational.
The locomotives were used on the Schlesische Gebirgsbahn and the adjacent branch lines until 1945, where they protected themselves against their reliable braking and the lack of maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were transferred to the middle German network.
Main area of operation was initially Schlesien
The handworking model H0 in OVP, works well, optical adjustments on the lathe are necessary, hand cut, with play, Kellergeruch!!!, very rare handworking model, very small scale - possibly the scale is also from the small company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN

I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The central beam is held in place by two sides. Unfortunately, these are too small and the beam cannot be mounted on the sides.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle column is held in place by two feet, but these are unfortunately missing.
The central beam does not fit into the provided holder.
I also received new information.
When will they be sent back?
No flat.
According to the montage director, they were just too slow
But that's no matter.
Main purpose is to fulfill their purpose
They don't work for me
Can I get this shipped?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two injured and severe damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in an apartment in Oberbayern.
The police also reported on Sunday that an estimated damage of six billion euros was caused in the euro area.
The fire had spread from a carport to the neighbouring house in Kinsau (district of Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were taken to the hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not think it was caused by arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But it comes much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To counter fake news - Biontech CEO publishes impeccable photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021
Uğur Şahin, CEO of Biontech, has so far remained silent about his illness.
Now the entrepreneur has posted a photo showing his corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend prompted him to make the announcement, Şahin said.
Uğur Şahin, CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, has published a photo showing how he receives an injection against the coronavirus.
There were false information on social media that I was not arrested.
In fact, my wife and I received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a LinkedIn post.
"Since a few months, my friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me wearing a crown to counter these false rumors."
Up to now, he has ignored this because communication should not be about him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply depressed when I realized that an old school friend was fighting for his life.
He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not arrested, Şahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
However, the most common cause seems to be fear, often caused by false information and lack of trust," he said.
Fears are hard to fight with facts, sometimes it's better to share personal experiences.
In an interview with Deutsche Welle, Uğur Şahin says he is not afraid.
However, the video was released in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself stated.
At the time, Şahin said that it was not allowed for me to get the drug itself.
In Germany, there is a priority in the implementation of the vaccination.
Now the priority has been raised for a long time - and the head of Biontech has admitted to three times.
Fire in power plant: Ten thousand people without electricity
In many municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday night: no electricity, probably no heating either.
One fire had caused a power outage.
After a fire in a substation with serious damage, tens of thousands of people in the Rhin-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have been without electricity for around 24 hours.
The fire affected 41,000 residents and residents in several municipalities on Friday evening.
The operator Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous fiber-optic cable aggregations were out of service until the large-scale disturbance could be completely resolved late at night.
Firefighters and volunteers from the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered places in schools and called for neighbourhood help.
The person responsible thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are aware that significant restrictions have been imposed on us in the last 24 hours.
We also thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their unwavering commitment, said Florian Witt, head of the primary technology department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few days, as the Westnetz cable engineers were initially only able to restore some of the services provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect was to blame for the fire.
Power flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at around 5.15 p.m. damaged parts of the 10,000-volt power system in the Neunkirchen Seelscheid substation.
There are necessary maintenance and repair works there.
This was achieved by connecting to a 30,000-volt power line.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is once again restored.
Since Saturday, 18,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power restored.
Further 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually evacuated from 21.30.
Since 23:15, the power supply to those affected by the outage has also been restored.
Over 80 Westnetz and partner firms were deployed.
The authorities had also called on neighbouring communities on Saturday afternoon to help with the power supply to important buildings.
It is now important that citizens in their local community take care of the elderly and alone people and help out at the local fire stations if needed, explained county councillor Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The inhabitants of Altenheimen in particular were at the centre of attention when it came to setting up and running the not-for-profit aggregator.
According to the authorities, emergency accommodation has also been provided in schools for those people who cannot take care of themselves or those who need medical equipment dependent on electricity.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold in Germany.
Can I buy them for you and pay in euros?
It is the Tagesdecke #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day and stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount it on the tabletop.
It is a custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions.
We wanted those with a diameter of #NUMBER#
We have 155 cm in diameter.
My #PRS_ORG# arrived today, but I cannot put it down and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send her back, since she is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy with a reminder
That is really easier!
Then we'll do it!
Can you send me the receipt by mail?
The repair is now completed.
I tried this before the chat.
However, before the purchase, I had not started the E-#PRS_ORG# again.
Should I do that now?
I find it almost unbelievable that such a low signature is required.
We are not satisfied
Northern Combination: Combiner wins
The German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid finished sixth at the World Cup in Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to give in to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a large lead after the ski jump.
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
We both made a new version and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have already encountered problems
It also seems that he bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#.
If I open it, the message comes in!
This document could not be opened.
It may be possible to report the error to the customer service.
As long as I can recognize it, it's an #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me further?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I also have to work through!
In order that the dyeing task is carried out evenly and smoothly, you should clean the fabrics with a little bit of washing-up liquid, cream and fingers, rinse and dry them with clear water.
Before you pin the first pin with a new color on the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 times.
This is no longer visible on the interior surface of the furniture or on a yoghurt cup.
The first nail on the wall
Look at the pin straight on.
The slight overlap of the color layers later results in a homogeneous surface.
Hide quickly and come back with the pin.
This leads to unrealistic areas.
Not a garden shed.
Start with the bright colors.
The darkness could only be penetrated later.
Metallic tinsel and metallic colors come to the end with a separate pin.
Otherwise, it can come to unsightly metal shards if it gets mixed with normal paint.
Leave the parts in place for a day before you remove them.
The models achieve an original appearance through the use of decals and detachable images.
From airline logos on aircraft to ship names and model numbers: The decals give the model the final touch.
Bring the decals in the right order, as long as the parts are still good to reach.
The cockpit of a plane can easily be torn apart before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool, such as a chisel, pliers and saw, is the ability to stay calm and steady while working.
Take off any unnecessary decals and put them down.
Decals are also called water images, because you could easily wipe them away with water until the paper underneath is revealed.
Then you just take a small piece of paper and place it on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have previously marked).
While you are holding the decal to the model with a craft knife, you are moving the donor paper away from you.
Attention: Always check that the image is correctly positioned before you completely remove it from the paper so that it does not get stuck to your fingers, knits or tears.

Not suitable for children under 3 years old
I can only open a book for a brief moment, until I find something else to do then I don't read the book anymore and have to log out and sign in and reload the book and search for my place until I have read it.
I already communicated with them on Saturday.
Do I get this by email?
For all three packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 individual packages to me
Thank you anyway!
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But can I solve the problem?
Child abuse in PKV / What is a "protection case"?
Hello together,
We were doing some infant care for a while, and now that we're getting ready to switch to the PKV, this suddenly seems very important.
The series continues:
We had applied for the children's ward at the PKV and received the promise for 3 trials.
The attempts were limited in some way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt resulted in a successful pregnancy and birth and was terminated with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and did 2 (successful) attempts, but these did not result in the PKV.
We again asked for the costs to be shared by the PKV and received 3 more attempts.
After several other attempts (we carried out more attempts than planned, logically the most expensive with the PKV) we settled the accounts with the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2 + 3) the PKV wants only 3 attempts.
The argument: With the pregnancy/birth, the other 2 attempts of the first attempt failed.
The second child is a new insurance case.
According to AGB, however, "the insurance event begins with the medical treatment, and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round:
Who has the right, the PKV (only 3 attempts are allowed) or we (there are 5 attempts to be made)?
* Did the PKV have to point out in the summaries that with one birth the other attempts failed?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to blocked tubes) will not be cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would share their opinion here.
Many thanks for your help!
Could you kindly send me the three versions of the brochure and tell me how I can get the best one?
In order.
We will no longer order anything from them.
If they add the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost a good customer.
They can tell their manager that.
That is not competitive.
My college mate told me yesterday that my refund was approved and now you are telling me I have to send it back.
I may not be able to help but the comforts completely upset me
Please show in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear and obvious that the refund was requested and I still haven't received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our home via his account.
We will no longer do that.
No, the defect did not occur until a few months ago.
An office chair must be used normally.
They must not sell him as a seating arrangement.
The warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to produce another kind of packaging.
I will remove the obstacle and make the person available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are offered with additional hinges, but we unfortunately do not find them in you.
Can you help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
What makes a low-budget film, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say about this:
**Low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little or no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web, you can find rich lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What do you think about that?
And what does not please you at all?
As a very good customer of yours, I have already set up two homes with your furniture.
She wanted to find the best price for a grey couch.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this also reliable?
Many thanks
With friendly greetings
If it doesn't have a phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, it's not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing has changed in the waiting position...I will then give it another go because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Second victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
But the costs are very high and will cause massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees in Belarus," the border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Agency (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation, explained the researcher from the Berlin-based foundation for science and politics (SWP).
This state of web-ness - Belarus is not exactly small, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably go on for a while.
The treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
It seems that there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not making a decision, this is at the expense of the fundamental rights.
This development weakens at the same time the cohesion in the Union.
"She seems unable to impose herself when a member state is putting its neck on the line to do its thing," as Poland is currently doing, not to mention the fact that the EU border protection agency Frontex has allowed access to the border.
In addition, the EU has paid a further price for its policy on the borders with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy will be reached, as the line "boundary protection, boundary protection, boundary protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to information from the Polish border protection, he has once again tried to get migrants to the Polish territory via Belarus.
On Sunday, 55 migrants were arrested and returned to the border, said a spokeswoman for the authorities.
The Polish officials were throwing stones at the migrants near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border protection registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had already breached the border fences.
In recent months, thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU or attempted to do so.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of being the ruler in Minsk with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have closed border sections.
The EU imposed sanctions on Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioner for Home Affairs is visiting origin countries of people to discourage them from travelling there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
The EU has thrown away its market power and shown its resolve with tough sanctions and extraterritorial actions."
Moscow must also account for domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is not prepared to accept that the security apparatus routinely smuggles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
Max Verstappen, according to Mercedes, is said to have made two illegal pit stops during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has made an appeal.
The silver spoons hinted at two wins in the last Grand Prix of the year.
The protest is based on a supposed error by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he should have been overtaken.
Second appeal has been lodged against the race finish.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in its entirety.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes in the last race and was eager for his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver occurred shortly after the end of a safety car phase during which the Dutchman had overtaken vehicles ahead of him.
I am checking this.
I speak to the bank and report to them again
Thank you for the support
Free entry for members: Europe Park hosts SC Freiburg's friendly
The Europa Park, named after the Europa Park stadium of the Freiburg sports club, has been invited to Freiburg.
As the park announces, members of the sports club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community are welcome to visit the Europa Park for free on this day.
There were also treats for drinks and sausages.
On this day, the rear suspension towers were lit up in red and white.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white air balloons made the perfect pictures, says the park.
Cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the Freizeitpark in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has been in place since the early 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europe Park, it has once again been demonstrated how well the partnership fits.
Seeing stray fans having fun together in the stands confirms that," says Europe Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is the €#NUMBER# and not 1699€?

Judith Hermann talks about her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" literary tour, author Judith Hermann visited the Blue Note on Friday to talk about her current novel "Daheim" and also served as moderator.
She is determined, lives in a house on the coast and listens attentively to the sounds of her bedroom at night.
I submitted the contact form to return an article yesterday, but I didn't receive an email confirmation or anything like that.
My question is whether my question has been answered.
Not everyone has the time for your chatty chats and cheaply delivered Chinese goods.
Your mistake, which you are covering up and not everyone from our household.
Contact the lady #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We agreed yesterday that I would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a new order for the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
This email has not yet arrived.
The package wants to bring #PRS_ORG# today.

Well, then you are similar to your colleagues in being unconcerned.
Anyone seriously questioning the evolution is simply lost.
For this reason, a god has brought everything into existence.
But once you become a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just nonsense.

Tannen for sale in Schönwolde: women in the Krembz community are collecting Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many strange situations at the slaughterhouse.
Once a man is supposed to go home even without his partner as the two could not agree on anything.
He grows 2000 plants for this every year.
The 56-year-old has already experienced a lot of curious situations in the course of this.
This makes the Christmas period always a little fun, he says.
And with the coupon??
Otherwise, I am a customer?!
After all, I received a defective product and now have to pay the full price.
Then I'll judge that accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions about the better judiciary here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a skewer.
And both have their names.
In German it would be something like the "Dreher", which is by far not as appealing.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass door for a couple of weeks now.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable WiFi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which had received and sent 50 Mbit up to a few seconds ago.
The new fibre optic cable connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, will also receive this.
However, the other DLAN module, which is responsible for the WiFi, no longer has the full 500, but rather I remove myself from the house with the module, much less comes to (so I use a dose that is 1, 2, 3, etc. removed from other modules).
This means that the Internet is now even slower with the new glass fiber filter (~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DL, but there were also similar big losses.
Can someone explain to me why with glass fiber so much internet speed is lost over the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables in the house.
I'm really excited to have created an account here.
That is why I am more than happy to provide an answer.
When is it time to change the card?
If you had thought there would be calm at the Giro accounts, you'd be wrong.
While many banks used the autumn to confirm to their customers the fee increases of the past, the interest rates for negative deposits are also falling further.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, had a margin of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved her freebie allowance and even turned it into cash for the day.
In a first step, the limit was only increased for customers of the group Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current and savings accounts and to 25,000 euros for day-to-day accounts.
However, these lower limits apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesman.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "individual new agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already run up a limit of 50,000 euros, which remains in place, as is the case with ING Germany.
Direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced its fees in two stages, initially to €50,000 and now to €25,000.
After all: More than 100 banks, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, now have a limit of 25,000 euros or less.
The savings bank in Berlin also received 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance had obtained legal rights against this regulation from the Berlin State Court.
Now banks are already discussing whether they should set up reserves - in case the upper levels also consider negative interest rates to be unsustainable, and have to pay back many millions of bank customers.
The table for eight was delivered instead of the one for six.
The accommodation is suitable for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is about to change for the better.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman in the year.
For her, the success in 2021 with the "Friends" remake and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show" was the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists and trainers are devoted to her appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, you can get a chip in the day (yes, really: a one-dollar chip from the jar).
It is truly a miracle that she has managed to win the hearts of both female and male fans.
Perhaps because she simply has good luck - and is still looking for the big love.
And the baby's wish has been fulfilled.
She had been asking for this all day, when she would finally be a mother.
That hurt her.
Those who asked had no idea what it was like for me personally, medically, why I couldn't.
It was really hurtful.
Hope remains that success and glory will follow.
Unbelievable end of a career for Räikkönen: he must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's retirement from Formula 1 came even more quietly than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old finisher stepped out of the water exhausted and sweating.
That was it.
After a drive-through penalty and a slight toque, Räikkönen was forced to retire his Alfa Romeo at the halfway line at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" concludes his career in the top class of motorsport.
His wife Minttu and the two children also accompanied him to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He won 21 grand prix races, started 18 times from pole position and came to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich Holt wins 60th World Cup - Nolte scores in double - Sports
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories is the target of the Bob pilot.
I have calculated that I need to win four out of five races this season to be able to make it to Cortina in 2026, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who won two races in two days in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he defended Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundred dollars, in which he ran from third to first.
Then he changed something in the setup and went out on Sunday with 0.30 seconds of a bigger lead.
With his team of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer  (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he defeated British competitor Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We took a greater risk today and were rewarded, said Friedrich, who also celebrated his 22nd victory in a row.
Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was travelling to Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time, two places behind.
Christoph Hafer of BC Bad Feilnbach came fourth in the first race and eighth in the second.
If I knew what he was doing, I would do it too, Lochner said.
Home victory for Jamanka - Podium
On her home track, Laura Nolte claimed the third win of the season in the pair.
After reaching fourth place in the Monobob on the previous day, she raced to victory on Sunday at the German three-day event, when she beat competitor Deborah Levi.
Zweierbob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, in second place.
She recorded the first podium place this winter in addition to her Olympic qualification.
Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki and Leonie Fiebig of Austria finished in third place.
For me it was supercool to be the first woman in the world cup, I am super happy that Mariama took me on.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but today’s start times were okay," said Burghardt, emphasizing that "it’s not just about acceleration, but there is also a lot to do in the middle."
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not entirely faultless driving, but said: "It is going in the right direction."
I already had the curtains in the store and could buy them now!!!
What should I do?
I did not receive him and therefore could not help but ask why.
Last year, due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now it turned out that he had lied to me.
Check out what went down in the chat about the Asare Sitzbank.
I would like to return it and then order it again, since it is reduced at the moment:)
Why was the ship not sent until 16.3.
There was no such long waiting time on their website
No, not until I come across an extra field with the message
He was arrested by his colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent them pictures of the fake beer.
But we want to keep the luxury model, just a new, undamaged one
And not cancel the entire order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello ladies and girls and women,
I have something I want to write down and perhaps someone else will do the same...
I'm 24, have a degree in psychology, full-time student and dog mama - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't speak or goes to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J) is sick, has a fever of 2 and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we have had a lot of fun and it was nice.
I helped him with the cleaning (because he has a fire in his hand).
He is getting colder these days, and we are seeing less (1-2x per week) of what makes me crave and love my Zune.
My dog has just had diarrhea, I thought he was sick and now he is in his crate and has relaxed a bit after I was using the steam lamp and rubbing his belly for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now there is also housework for us to do, which we will of course do.
But even shaving is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS is just under control, I am halfway through my therapy and I am doing well.
Not good, but I'm coming down and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university requires a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15 I have a written test for which I have still done little and over the morning Anatomy class for which I should at least be prepared.
And next week I have a physical exam, and what comes up in my calendar and not in my head because there is no space left.
My week is the same way too: Just until tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But after that, does it go on?
Just until the birthday.
Only until the holidays begin.
Only until the weekend.
Just until...
And this will continue forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need these mental breaks, because otherwise I pack it in.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it...
Is it the same for you?
Honestly, I am incredibly grateful that I don't have to work.
I really cannot thank them enough.
I don't know if I would have survived my capture.
I believe that has something to do with mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find some sympathetic ears here...
I wish you all a relaxing evening anyway, the week is almost over!
I received my order today unfortunately the whole other colour plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has been pressed in.
The color of the first delivery was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we get the table now, I'll get other colors or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In addition, there are two.
But she was not confirmed.
The situation was completely different: I had noticed in school at the time that many religious teachers did not believe in God and it was just another subject for them like maths or geography.
For me, this always felt a little odd, maybe also because I was Christian and I always believed in something.
How are you doing?
Maybe you can also tell your colleagues about different stops.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is sensible to separate.
Does it also provide a lesson plan?
But it seems odd to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in relativity theory.
What makes one want to believe in religion when one does not believe?
Is it true culture or something else?
Hoffe is not asking for privacy.
Can it not be changed or not? Write in English, I also understand it well
That's been going on for a very long time, and then I'd turn off.
Good, thank you.
I expect a reply by the earliest possible date next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search for help
Hello people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for teenagers.
The film features two time travelers (or parallel universes).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
For another, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely certain).
In the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths intersect and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to live so he can bring the woman to this realm.
I also believe that the change is the grave of the soldier.
In the end, both soldiers fought against each other.
If that is what it says, I am for any answer.
Our little one has only been sleeping on the couch for a week.
Fast forward: still alive: D
Enjoy yourself.
So a child sees much more than one thinks.
Don't worry if things seem to be going wrong, just take a step back and look, but don't over-analyse for a minute.
That makes you really nervous!
Fresh air in the room.
Good friends.
No kiss.
We also had no mattress, but a ceiling.
Watch your child when they play.
Does it hurt?
Is something wrong with the roof?
Or is it just a matter of face?
You can check if everything is in order.
We have all gotten fat and when my husband came home from the war, it was a big change and they would put the kids to sleep on the couch.
We are also "regular customers" to them and have already bought a lot of articles
But why only 20 euros?
Hello, I wrote to you yesterday and so far no reply.
It is about my prescription, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right wing clique does not fit in the rank.
I would like to contact you as soon as possible.
The rank is currently not to be used.
To be quite clear.
RBTV has a lot to say.
And yes, I know, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is just that the politicians have now got on top of this issue.
Fast every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big bike tour at the same time.
It was said that you are an "independent" Internet provider.
Zitat Arno: You don't want to be a "living chore".
What is it now?
An 0815 ad, trying to rope in the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, this applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, people should be allowed to complain.
Someone without any empathy whatsoever is trying to make a profit from the action by renting out the rooms that have exploded.
How do you find all this?
If it pleases you, I find it frightening.
I would like a refund, as my delivered refrigerator malfunctioned.
Breakdown of the #PRS_ORG# due to overloaded delivery.

Is the battery dead?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my network.
I bought this about 5 months ago and it should still work.
I thought that the network alone is sufficient for operation.
The battery is dead and the laptop won't turn on, despite the attached network cable.
Then I charged the battery, but it didn't work.
Have you got any ideas?
I order a new battery, but why can't I use my laptop online?
Is something else broken?
Many thanks for your help!
I would like to have the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I do this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seating area is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
The 20-liter fuel tank also allows for larger photo equipment without any problems, which is sure to impress with the help of the polished flexfold sections.
And if you need everyday items, thankfully the practical storage in the individually configurable interior room is well organised and easy to find.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
Its minimalist design is clever in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed a number of highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and at the same time provide quick access to the camera.
This has two options: Either conventionally over the top the cover, which can be locked with the MagLatch closure system, or a brilliant solution for effective protection that has already been mentioned, the Messenger Bags.
In the luggage strap there is a metal clip closure with adjustable clasp.
Unlike most rucksacks, Peak Design has considered different "filling factors": there are four attachment points, two on each side, into which the compression straps can be inserted.
If the backpack is full, simply take the top shelf, if it's rather empty, take a deeper one.
Glow plugs and sensors are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can also be securely closed without needing to fasten the straps.
The second option differs from the Everyday Backpack in principle as well: in addition to the zip closure, there is also a strip closure on both sides of the bag.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of common rucksacks with access from the top - you no longer have to dig through the content!
At the same time, this simple detail increases the practicality of the bag: if you are not only taking your camera, but also everyday items or a travel kit.
You can individually configure the interior space in the Everyday Backpack (click for more details) and put the two open sides together in a jiffy - without needing any tools.
You can also pull the right side of the bag from in front of the body to access the camera gear in the right main compartment, while the day-to-day things stay safely in the left backpack half and don't get in the way.
Elegant, uncomplicated silhouettes are the order of the day.
And since the outside of the backpack is also made of 100 percent recycled, water-resistant nylon, the content itself stays dry even when heading to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I am waiting for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the transfer
Contact was made with the expedition to release the wrongly delivered sheep.
I haven't received any news yet.
I request immediate withdrawal.
I am now already in communication with the third support employee, and I received a confirmation email for the mail I sent.
It is a case of mistaken identity.
So, when can the rank be delivered again?
For me, it is not an option to keep them like this...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
Wishing you a beautiful evening
hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when will the article be delivered?
The order and payment was made on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will immediately issue a larger order, but I will keep the damaged item and not send it back.
And that last year was different from what I could have imagined and I did not have time to prepare and explain.
But as a customer, I do not accept the damage.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event changed the course of the West Coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered a fire on the southern bank of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news quickly spread and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Chains were pulled out, windows smashed, and bars and hotels opened almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or Bust)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who is looking for wealth in the west and wants to make a name for yourself.
You will be looking for gold, recruiting workers, felling trees and building companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to meet your pioneering colleagues to avoid going broke with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many reasons to win.
At the same time, they choose your actions, have to keep their resources and set up a table that works for you more and more (called "engine building").
The buildings on your table allow you to become more efficient, obtain additional actions or use rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge promenade, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of clever arrangements.
Coloma spans three years, from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California became an official state).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
While every round the players choose a location on the map secretly and simultaneously, where they can carry out actions.
Afterwards, their selection is unveiled and they place their pioneers in suitable locations.
If a location has most of the pioneers, it gets a break!
This deactivates one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving vehicles, setting traps, searching for rivers, building bridges, opening businesses and positioning revolver guards.
If all actions are completed, the pioneers will return.
At the start of each round, the caller will change locations, thereby changing the available actions.
This will continue until the caller has moved five times, that is, until the caller has been disconnected from one location and reconnected at another.
There is a shooting part where the players have to defend themselves from angry bandits.
If the players have carried enough revolvers and dealt with the bandits in a calculated manner, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive smaller rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shot, then the final score is calculated.
The player with the most wins wins!
For free shipping, I take up to 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm, the shipping method, express delivery (games shipped).

Why children are not tyrants Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation is now appearing in my Twitter timeline and I have checked it out.
The child psychotherapist Michael Winterhoff is happy to be a guest in talk shows and holds positions in Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he triggered a strong educational debate.
Former patient: home and educational rights are now being violated against him.
Please bear in mind that the film is difficult to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We, as parents and other responsible persons, should never, never, never take power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space to develop and a framework for the child to grow up in, as is appropriate and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: States warn against test penalty for three strikes
The Health Ministers of the Länder want to decide on a national approach to the imposition of a test on three occasions at their next meeting.
We need clarity quickly as to when and by how many times the trial obligation can be imposed on countries, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, in an interview with "Bild am Sonntag".
The use of 2G plus for three times is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to make a proposal to the Health Minister's Conference on the upcoming Tuesday. - afp
I also want to send the lamp back
How do I get there best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# very nice, but I can't see how high the seating area is.
Can you help me further?
I can't wait to get my hands on my #PRS_ORG#.
Error: Ups, an error occurred.
You can make a purchase from the #PRS_ORG# page on our computer.
I have updated the data.
What can this be about?
What you are describing as *Awareness*, i.e. conscious perceptions under full control.
These occur with a frequency of around 1 to 1000.
The most common occurrence is hearing voices/sounds, rarely seeing images, and even more rarely experiencing pain.
Relevant topic: Surgery is a high-risk procedure that involves a high rate of awareness, as anesthesia is used to protect the child until the operation is complete.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the discussion about narcotics.
Specific anesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) have a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT** All right, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but had u/Nitemarex by definition not existed.
Have you read the comment wrong?
The chair is however defective.
The 20 euros did not help either.
These are legal claims for damages.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take the damaged seat back.
This is also standard practice in the eCommerce sector.
Please check again if you at least want to take back the damaged chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I sent you an email that you didn't reply to.
Still the question.
In the order and on the invoice, it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The sender is Firma #NAME#.
I called there.
He told me that they only deliver to the door because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If that's the case, I have to cancel the order, because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture in the first place.
Should I not be called?
I had a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies at the age of 97
He has become known as a theater critic and as an administrator.
Later, he wrote a monumental theatrical history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle, 97, died.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed, with the old man getting older.
The harrowing diary of a slow death from the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle has been conducting until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is "Ich bezeuge hier mal meinen Lebensdank".
There are various types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are used as load carriers in particular in the European region.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from the Austrian Statistics Office, 10 million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria every year will not be raised

Rouladen Tipps & Tricks
I got many great tips for the perfect gulasch here a week ago.
There was a lot of it at Christmas and it was incredibly sweet and buttery!
Thank you again:)
Now I have come to the taste and want to bake Christmas cake for the first time.
I will go for a run tomorrow.
Do you have any tips for me otherwise?
Reminder: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.

I was informed by email on the 18th.01. that the refund had been processed.
But until today, the money has not been received by me.

Where is there still some Christmas meat in Lübeck
For many people, Gans or Ente is part of the Christmas tree like the tannenbaum and the gifts.
Are you not worried about flying?
Now the time is almost up.
We promise you where to find a Christmas brat in the room Lübeck.
The "drive" of a humbucker has a major impact on warmth and tone.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the valve reactor control.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-Regler, you can set the desired pegel and at the same time control the level of your sound.
In addition, the Verstärker of the VT+ series offers a unique power level controller that allows you to reduce the sound level without having to change the "gain" and distortion.
Further up, the POWER LEVEL-Regler allows even a small performance reserve if necessary.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The cup holders can also be used as a line-out.
This signal is then processed by a box simulation so that you, too, will get an acoustic impression when using a speaker or when shooting direct.
You can attach a CD or MP3 player to the auxiliary input jack so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
The car also has a tuner function - you don't need a separate stereo.
If you also invest in a VFS5 footswitch, which allows you to summon the sounds easily with your foot, you can switch the effect engines on/off and adjust the tempo of the corresponding effects.
For live events, this is actually unthinkable.
With his new power pack, VOX is taking another step towards the future!
But that has not been the case with others.
Do you have the possibility to send the lamp back?
Why don't they eat for dinner?
I would also like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
And the comfort?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, are you already sitting on the #PRS_ORG# stage?
If it doesn't work out, I would be happy with a refund or voucher.
In the end, I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need anymore.
I have already received my delivery and I would have liked to know if shrubs were part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the wall as planned.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worth it
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
According to Iranian sources, progress is being made in the negotiations for a renewal of the international nuclear agreement.
Both sides are in the process of agreeing on the topics to be covered on the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development" because initially there was not even unity on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the talks in Vienna to revive the agreement were resumed after almost a week of deadlock.
Participants in the negotiations include representatives of Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia.
An American delegation is also in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now has the highest corona infection rate
Thuringia has defeated Saxony and is currently showing the highest infection rate in the country.
As the only federal state, the value exceeds the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had more than 1,000 cases of coronavirus on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always had the highest infant mortality rate in the country, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the interest rates in Thüringen had been low, but also over the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, a total of 2242 new cases of the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths related to the infection were reported within one day.
On Sunday, 200 people were treated intensively in hospitals due to Covid-19.
There could be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely able to cope with new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it may be possible by then.
I have to write that down and put it in the package and send it to the post, was it?
What else do I have to do here?
That's what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take responsibility for my own costs.
The €8 deposit is a freedom in my eyes.
It's time for changes
The Bundestag greets me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the hearts of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the post about?
If you look at the activity in the past few months of the Bundestag, you can make one conclusion: It doesn't exist.
We got into a winter storm and had to deal with the snow for a few months.
What is the problem?
Yes, what is it?
For the most part, this is simply linked to dissatisfaction, as here some things have slipped through the cracks and as we generally stand up for ourselves.
Over the past few days, it has become increasingly clear that many people here still have hopes for the Bundestag election.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is being asked what it wants to do with this.
The move came from u/edizVEVO, who has become prominent on this project in recent days and who has found, simply put, a way to make a mess.
After some discussion and debate, several people from the community decided to revive the project.
However, I would like to once again call on all of you to participate, so that this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server to enable us to communicate and work on specific things together.
You can reach the server via this link.
Objectives:
How will the Bundestag work in the future?
What existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
How do we want to stand out in the future?
How should new members be appointed?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot something, but it's not so bad, we have the Discord at the end.
If you have a desire and time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade for them to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clumsy for my taste and not suitable for my taste.
For this, I already had made a different appointment with them.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the loose leaf.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and that I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one question: the daily cover #PRS_ORG#, do they also have overstocks, i.e. in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty rank will be rectified.
And I ask you to leave now.
I didn't have a suitable packaging, so I had to dismantle it as much as possible for transport - they need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can always contact me by telephone to arrange an appointment.
Does it have any instructions for the assembly?
How long would I have had time to worry about this and to decide myself?
Why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague who I like.
She herself has lived for a while on a vegetarian diet, and now eats meat very rarely.
I myself was also a vegetarian for a few years.
When asked if I always wanted to be vegan and if I had ever considered becoming vegetarian, I had an honest answer.
And it is true that I have long thought that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but at some point I understood that I would ultimately also support animal slaughter.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I got the impression that she defended veganism and said she knew where her meat came from and how as vegetarians we can reduce our impact on animals.
Now I wonder if my answer to "plump" was right?
How does she answer the question?
If the feeling one gets as a vegan is quickly put to one side and conflicts arise, one would like to address them.
It greets a harmonious vegetarian (;
It is not clear whether this is an exception to § 312d BGB.
Their #PRS_ORG# is not bound by the statutory provisions for remote transmission.
I am at the appointed date, on which #PRS_ORG# does not release my returns in person.
As I cannot be there in person due to a conflict, this unfortunately cannot be changed.
Could you please suggest an alternative holiday date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# onwards, I will be back in full force.
Lahnsteiner to pay 45,000 euros in compensation for water pollution
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a donation of 45,000 euros for the voluntary fire brigade in Lahnstein to the mayor, Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounts to 135,000 euros.
Good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this, says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is being used by the Lahnstein fire department, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatine.
They fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue, as well as in technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one always encounters increasing prices: the boom in hotel travel on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river are all contributing to this.
I bought a book that I could only read to 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, when they followed her advice, the app crashed, was removed and had to be reloaded NONE of the above worked.
I'm a little disappointed because the whole campaign has taken a lot of time and I hope now for help.
Okay, that's then.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the order process?

Thank you for taking the time to do this, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar position, we used to be called weapons dealers in the executive, I don't want to go there again!
The question of right and left always seems very clear to me.
But in principle one should say that the public servant comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
That, of course, should also be clear to everyone, that in the special uniform and weapons carriers, people should also be able to see the rights of conservatism magically, because of course it is also clear that these people can and will naturally struggle with the reality they live in, because of course it is also clear that you have, alongside the average white man, many Germans with a migration background, women and even homosexuals (and I am not exaggerating when I say that there are far too few women with executive positions, because there are none at all in the executive, only normal men and women who don’t even notice when they are not mentioned) and I must also leave it up to these people, because in doubt they will protect your life or set it for you.
But even these far-right groups feel that they represent Germany too, if it only sounds funny in my experience of a conservative stance. They are proud of Germany and feel that their left-wing politics is overpowering, even though that politics is supposed to be for their benefit and to make them right, they just want to be treated fairly.
Back to the rights, of course, because police and armed forces are also part of society, and you will also find extreme rights there; but they are allowed to express their opinions there, or even to denounce any plans that may endanger the state, and that is completely overpowering and annoying me as well.
Obviously, police officers and soldiers, who often went on foreign missions, often paused because of negative experiences and even said things that were politically incorrect.
It is also true that certain rightwing sympathizers will also be meeting each other in the rain.
Nevertheless, my opinion is well supported and also counteracted by political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined and to me that is a good thing that we could not possibly have true racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I did not understand, the other corb I also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it, it was not sold.
I already ordered in November.
It was confirmed to me, however, in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I had previously prepared with #NAME#.
Alternatively, the other #PRS_ORG# guitar for #NUMBER# euros could still be delivered to Germany or is this guitar available somewhere in Germany.
I always only see you as a partner.
There are, however, two low bushes on the edge of the woodland, which have been stuffed with something
and on the mirror itself is a small keyhole
Ordinary by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been occupied for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized on the job (I am self-motivated and have very little free time), but even my life-long I still get it more wrong than right in maintaining my household in a clean and orderly manner.
There are always periods when everything is quiet, and then and when it gets packed and I start to pack.
But it is never so "that someone could come and visit spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) also not better, it breaks my heart somewhere, but he usually just loses interest in work and motivation.
The kitchen is still regularly stocked as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to get along with the child?
We still have a lot to work on, but this issue is already occupying me for a long time.
Because for me there is no incentive, it just doesn't feel so doll-like as long as no one visits, and the kitchen is always available.
Is it true that one can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar?
I'm looking forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a personality disorder?
I have a degree in software development and have been studying for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am getting more and more the feeling that this job is not the right one for me, which is why I have been putting off starting over again and studying social work again for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-conscious personality disorder (also known as avoidant personality disorder).
This means that I have no self-esteem and therefore hide.
I have no problem talking to people on a more informal level, but it is very difficult for me to have relaxed conversations and I have already been told more times that I am unapproachable (which I think I have gotten better at).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a streetworker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, a job search center or a family support center.
I don't know if the actual working day really is as long as I remember it, and it's difficult to find something on the Internet about it.
The ÄVPS already causes problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it makes me dizzy every time there is something wrong with my code ("the simplest things are always the ones that get in the way") and it is hard for me to find more experienced colleagues to ask for help ("by now, I really should know how to do this myself"/"I keep forgetting to ask him for help"/"he must really trust me to do it properly" etc.).
I will probably have problems in any job, but I wanted to have mentioned it at the position.
But did you keep the sofa?
There was no confirmation for this.
I am waiting for a date for release
What do you want me to do with that?
If I load a book onto the #PRS_ORG#, does the message say your #PRS_ORG# authorised this book?
Are there any problems?
I was chatting to #PRS_ORG# on Twitter and he asked if I had received a confirmation of my booking.
The bird stores the fat with which it was fed (protein) in its gizzard and synthesises the individual amino acids contained therein, which it then needs for protein synthesis.
The formation of the nestling and the moulting of the adult bird are extremely complex processes and are closely linked to the overall well-being of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio may not be used during breeding as it can cause disruptions in the breeding programme.
In the wake of this generous donation from NEKTON Bio, the daily supply of vitamins with NEKTON S (multivitamin) and NEKTON MSA (mineral supplement) was resumed.

One gram NEKTON-Bio in 250 ml water or 100 grams of weed food.
You only need to prepare as much drinking water/softened water as the bird uses and changes it every day.
One gram of NEKTON-Bio corresponds to a spiked ball (illustration).
In cases of severe damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio may be administered at the start, until the approach of regeneration becomes visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose will be administered until the desired effect has been achieved.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored at a temperature between 15° and 25° C without direct sunlight.

Statement of a municipal employee in response to the dismissal
Hello r/ Legal Advice German,
I have the following problem.
On our plot, a walnut tree will be planted.
Also filed a complaint with the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the issue of fruit trees and thus also the compost heap is not part of the statement.
However, in the statement, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a tree to be protected.
Can I now leave a comment on the employee's statement?
On the one hand, I have to leave it to experts.
On the other hand, the verdict is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for this.
I have no news
Then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a memento or a coupon?
Why were they so expensive?
I believe that, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and if I can get the ceiling to Germany
Can you check it?
Eilmeldung: Heavy traffic accident in Selb
Recently, there was a heavy traffic accident on the St. 2179 between the Selb North and Plößberg junction.
According to the police press alert (14:03), a car came to rest in the wrong lane of traffic.
There are injured.
Okay, I understand.
Good, then a lot of thanks again that it went so easily!
Rat and ideas for further professional life
Only happy holidays to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately mediocre, because my head is full of everything one can think about.
Before I go any further... short version: I need advice and preferably from people who know my situation - that is, from you.
I'm doing the Ref as a qualifier.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked in an area (at least somewhat anonymously, I call it nothing precise).
The whole thing was then too long-winded and I got tired of alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I was met by the HR manager and was sure that was it - even if the terms and conditions were much more restrictive than my previous job, but that was me.
I am now at the third "I google other spellings".
And it is only half a year.
In the past, I always decided to stop there and at least finish the ref, after that I could still improve.
But I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
Now it is holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I would be stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my evening was also my evening.
I had it.
And the stress at work was equal in the moments.
Now the family party is too much stress for me.
And then there are these sturdy structures that keep me going.
In principle it is fun and from outside it looks good, too, which is good feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely breaks down - if it doesn't already.
I wonder if I would have wanted to do the rest of my working life like this - just reading some of your contributions here - or if I should have gone back into the old area, where I was valued, I could take free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow tedious but paid for, and done together in a team, rather than as individuals fighting for most of the time like it is now.
But then I ask myself, will I not have returned to the same position in a year, like now, dissatisfied?
You realize it's all sort of ridiculous, but maybe you have a sense of deja vu or ideas about how to get out of this situation, in which I am completely exhausted and almost ready to cry at the smallest thought.
I'm not really in the mood for that right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your opinions will help me see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me at the moment.
Thank you for reading and apologies for my lack of enthusiasm.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has developed steadily, which has led to the combination of the progressive modeling technology with the "valve reactor" control, which perfectly simulates the behavior of a variable speed drive.
With the VT20X, VT40X and VT100X amps, we have created a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely at the cutting edge of technology in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and the switching of the amplifiers, the VTX booster has an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also include the popular Valvetronix preamp.
This is partly based on actual analog switches, because these allow you to get a better idea of the sound variations and nuances of a speaker amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this, the VTX booster offers a sealed house and a bass reflex system, so that the natural resonances only grow louder.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct historical facts on the virtual level and proceed until the amp and effects sound like you always imagined them to.
The perfect combination of rumbling sound and modeling technology is to be found in the 2001 VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Of course, she was subsequently commissioned several times to add new sound requirements, which led to the VOX Valvetronix series being reinstated in 2010 - with more dynamism and numerous enhanced model versions.
The new VT+ Valvetronix series also includes the VT20+, VT30+ and VT120+ with two speakers, so all guitarists will find a maximum sound variety here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a pick-up: they expect a good sound, a nuanced delivery of sound and bite, and a prompt response.
While conducting an analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the nozzle diameter in particular determined the sound character of a booster. Based on this finding, VOX developed the VOX Valve Reactor Technology.
The valve reactor pressure control system of each VT+ booster is equipped with a 12AX7 barrel, and the subtle nuances and sound character of the barrel are perfectly reproduced.
NBA - Despite 20 points by Wagner, Magic loses to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but victory against the Los Angeles Clippers is not enough.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 106:104 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main lens is also easily adaptable: with three individually adjustable zoom lens sections, it is perfectly suited to your photo needs - from small system cameras of all sizes to full-frame mirrorless cameras.
The final decision on what goes into the bag depends of course on the size of the camera and the objective.
One possible compromise would be a DSLR camera with an interchangeable lens, two to three zoom lenses, and a flash.
Large DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for further objectives.
You can also get a lot of accessories.
And anyone with a small DSLM camera (Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the bag for their equipment and for photo-related things.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also an optimal choice for drone pilots, as it offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro drone, including extra batteries and accessories.
Vulkan eruption in La Palma: Longest in history
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the eruption on La Palma is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
So far, the eruption of the Vulkan volcano Tehuya in 1585 lasted 84 days and was the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists did not make any predictions about when it could stop.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in millions
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree-hot lava has almost destroyed 1,900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, two new landfills with a size of around 50 hectares have formed due to the accumulated lava.
The banana industry, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly hard hit. About half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants of the island live directly or indirectly from it, and it was already in crisis before the eruption.
The newspaper "El País" wrote that 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and further areas heavily affected.
Weihnachten and the gifts
Weihnachten is before the door and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the celestial festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have a spiritual atmosphere and a tense excitement to them.
Weihnachten is one of the few traditional celebrations that still bring our increasingly divided society together.
It is more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of shaving, so that the gestures of shaving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a kind of a "treaty of peace between societies," can break the stark routine and can be filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How the Christkind was born
It was the Protestants who held fast to the traditional observance of the Christmas season.
Previously, gifts had been exchanged on the Nikolaustag, one way or another.
The background of this still popular site is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three gold coins into her window at night to save their souls.
This unconventional way of shopping led to the popular use in Germany, especially for filling the stockings of children with presents.
Protesters seized on this need because they rejected intermediaries between God and the people as "holy missionaries."
For these reasons, they are against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christkind from the Nikolaus and thus established a new tradition.
The focus of the celebration shifts to the evening.
Since most Protestants no longer see such details so seriously, it is only the fewest who are irritated that the need for the holy Nicholas is still a part of the Christmas season, just like the need for the Magi with their gifts.
Today, one can find everything in Stiefeln in front of the Türe and under the Weihnachtsbaum of Socken, up to luxurious headphones.
Various traditions in Christian countries
According to tradition, the coat of arms dates back to the 13th century, to the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of mourning was shifted to Friday.
However, in all Christian countries, there is a joyful frenzy over the question of who is going to bring the presents to the children.
In Germany, it is up to the respective region whether the Christkind appears on the holy night or the Weihnachtsmann, who in principle is a kind of Nikolaus, who over time acquired some characteristics.
This includes, for example, his white horse, which is only little known to the general public, and his chariot, which is rented by the hour, and the fact that getting into the houses requires a key.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at the Christmas festival.
In Spain, the Three Kings give gifts, while in Italy the Queen of Hearts is said to have led them to Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fairy tales are the gifts, while in Russia, it is the chivalrous frost that prevails.
Here there are no pensioners, but three horses that pull a trailer as a Troika.
In the Czech Republic, the country of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite war, the Christkind is responsible for the transfer of goods.

Many thank you.
Police arrest suspected bank robbers near the royal palace
On Saturday, a police officer was shot in the vicinity of Kensington Palace in London.
The police said that callers reported seeing a man with a gun in a bank and the business of a bookstore.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was later stopped by officials.
There were shots fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
Several campaigns have been launched in the Kensington Palace area.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
What?
No matter where I click, I will be immediately redirected to your side.
The decorative lights add a harmonious touch to every garden area or pathway.
The light is simply turned on and can be angled with two ground stakes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Max. 10 hours of light
The robust art supply chain is available throughout the year in the outdoor area.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly dangerous objects from faraway galaxies that glitter brightly.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is harmless: the sun alone ensures that these solar cells produce fascinating light - optionally in white or bright colors (in six different color shades).
The invisible, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a natural shape, this modern light object presents itself at day.
His organic layouts adapt to any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the grass or in the cobblestones.
He also makes a good living in neighbouring countries, where he can boast of his great knowledge.
You can save a lot of time: "Smart Stone" is not only illuminated but also powered by the sun or by batteries.
Put the "light beam" in the hands of a popular spot, known for its sunny day.
Two suspended beams provide support in case of need.
The matt-weave fabric itself is robust and waterproof.
Its solar module is discreetly integrated into its interior, together with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for coloured light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the house.
With its disruptive display, "Smart Stone" can even light itself up; which colour do you want it in? At the same time, six other attractive light colours are available - including white - for you to choose from.
The switch also happens automatically as soon as the battery level drops to a preset minimum or gets too low.
As soon as the sun appears again, the waste collection starts on the next day.
I have already done this several times and it has not worked.
Shame, I would like to continue to order from them, but if the coupon is not accepted, then I will not order from them in principle.
If you think differently, then give me a call.
Otherwise, this was the last contact.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.

The motor control of the LokSound 5 was once again improved.
An adjustable PWM frequency of 10 kHz to 50 kHz is precisely what is required for the operation of solenoid valves – and this is what the typical “humming” sound was made up of.
The last rule now also applies to cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "autotune" function automatically adjusts the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder also delivers enough juice with up to 1.5 A motor current for older motors.

Pill problem
Hello, women’s people,
I hope I do everything right, after a year Reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: Five years ago, I started to take the pill again, mainly because I had so bad pain during the period and disregarded PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave it at that, because I already take enough medication for chronic illnesses that I can't afford.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had a blast from 0 to 100 in my last two hours and this is it.
As far as I am concerned, this is quite superficial, but it has really hit me and I have not felt well.
In the two years of pause, everything has never really normalized.
Perhaps someone has some tips on how to avoid this.
My cosmetics are free of perfume and scented, but maybe someone can recommend something else.
The gynecologist has not taken me seriously enough and the hairdresser has not come yet.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the book!
The skin is so sensitive.
Hate getting bad neurodermatitis, then having a period of rest, then big areas of skin that itch and the acne issue.
I have also tried everything possible in the course of my illness and have remained on a diet of fruit, milk and cheese because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It can also be good that hormones are simply the devil to get to the bottom of, but when you have like I have all over building sites, you just don't want to go looking for what is wrong any more.
I already knew everything about her colleague.
I wrote it down and now I lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my question.
I had to work through the night and suddenly everything was gone...

In the courtroom, she sits in everyday clothing on the bench.
But much depends on her verdict, even if she does not wear a robe: Goods are judged with professional judges, whether and for how long someone is behind bars.

110 kV underground cable to be built in 2022
The approval for the transfer of the new high-voltage line to Tann is legally sound.
The government of Lower Bavaria's decision to approve the plan makes construction possible, which is to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the internet provider Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will link the Tann power substation in the north of the municipality with the existing 110-kV line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is attached to a mast near the town of Edermanning in Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.
The blue phone number: #PRS_ORG# with the sending number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the comment "non-messaging possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a switch is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the further procedure is now?
Great start to the week!
You can forget that I already explained that to you yesterday!!

Ref: Teaching plans (EK)
Hello colleagues and friends,
I have been in the Ref since the summer, and the teaching makes me happy, but I currently have major problems planning my lessons in environmental science.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped technically, so that in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In the school, I can also only copy free of charge (which is expensive).
I just need a lot of time right now to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geographical factors, and for me, every hour counts.
In principle, the methods also repeat themselves again and again, but I do not want to invest too much time in easy teaching hours (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
I actually always plan from the learner's point of view (what I want to achieve) and then outline how I can achieve it (usually by making an worksheet with texts from books my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the assignments in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
This also applies to the working hours.
Maybe a landscape gardener could show me how to work efficiently with a book.
I would really like that.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I actually already made a decision for a new album with #PRS_ORG#, but I would really like to wait until I can release it as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G regulation being a Christmas present.
In most shops, only those who are wearing masks or gloves are allowed in.
The trade association considers this unnecessary and accuses the authorities of price fixing.
He also suggested a possible solution.
The 2G rules are losing out for trade association Germany (HDE) the important Christmas trade.
For businesses with non-critical needs, HDE's chief executive, Stefan Genth, criticised VAT increases.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negative on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already cancelled their Christmas trade.
What should be the positive highlight of the year is often a hole without a bottom, said Genth.
According to the figures, dealers with 2G network access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-tax profits in the past week.
It is only in wholesale and online retail that things are going well.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
He emphasized that “2G will not take us any further in our fight against the pandemic.”
The current regulations scare customers and require a lot of personnel.
The ban on handguns must be allowed to apply nationwide, he demanded.
After that, every customer would have to be checked for 2G (unlicensed or licensed) and would have been barred from all businesses on this day.
In addition, in the case of individual sales - as is already the case in the public transport network with the 3G rules (first class, business class or first class) - samples should be stored for inspection.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies have recently been at around 75% of the pre-crisis level, with revenues around 90%.
These figures will now definitely fall to the middle of the so important Christmas trade," said Managing Director Wilhelm Wellner of "Wirtschaftswoche".
As a result of the high level of personal and administrative work, the centers are trying to find solutions and obtain approvals.
This includes the so-called "bandwidth solution", in which "visitors to a central point in the center can bring their 2G phones along and then, with an arm band similar to that of a club hotel, enter all transactions unaffected". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a crack, and the frame also has a defect, which was tried to be filled with the same material.
It looks beautiful.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed and shipped it back.
What should I do now for the return?
The lamp is dual-balanced, based on new, thin SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
For adjusting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with unique possibilities is responsible.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard temperature: daylight and artlight.
It is also possible to set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K manually.
Use the current settings in the flash storage.
Its special feature is that it is simple and intuitive to use.
The LED produces a very bright light with soft, high-quality light, completely free of glare.
The beam of 120 degrees makes it possible to see large areas at relatively small distances.
Also in reporting situations in small rooms or short scenes.
They can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on the set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the lighting to be controlled from a distance in television studios or when the lights are mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, which consists of buttons and a light display.
The display shows the current brightness in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is still a slot for the NP-F battery (not included in the delivery)
Storage capacity The storage capacity has up to three settings for brightness and color temperature.
To maintain the settings of the individual settings on the storage plates, simply apply a longer pressure to one of the storage plates and you're done.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when you switch it on, so that when you switch it on again, the known situation is restored - very practically for studio work if the camera is set to certain color temperature.
Battery-operated one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 The functionality of the DL3120 is boosted by the possibility of using low-cost NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester that is built in - for each of the two battery cells.
In addition, of course, it is possible to continue to supply the laser with electricity via the network.
The construction of the shield is very simple.
They have a 16mm lens attachment so that they can shoot straight to their camera.
The inclination is to use fixed anchors on both sides.
As a result, the mechanical components are extremely well made, and as a result, they are also very durable and resistant to hard use.
In addition, there is a discount for buying in bulk.
The fact that a bag is also included in the delivery is great.
This way, you can transport or store the lights with all the accessories you still want to buy without problems.
Shame, I forgot it and it is too small: (
Party we wanted to snub": Frankfurt celebrates comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the two-time defending champions of Hesse were apparently on their way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then the SGE hit the jackpot, scoring within a good hour of the season start and winning furiously with 5-2. "It is amazing what the boys have done today," cried coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and spoke of a "season-long lobbing of everyone who was involved".
At first, after a renewed burst of energy for the Frankfurt team, it looked like they would achieve their goal.
Patrik Schick had taken Leverkusen to the lead with a 2:0.
What happened then, the SGE coach also wondered.
Glasner continued: "Just like the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance."
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Even the defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the field for the first time since the fourth game day and his torn muscle, highlighted the morale of his team mates.
I think our mentality is unbelievably big, said the 27-year-old and enjoyed himself especially with a view to the result, for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the tasks that need to be done, and has done so with regard to the personnel situation.
It is exceptional that we all have been fit in December, that all players are in a top form.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professional lives.
Now one wants to "go step by step further and stay at this level" and work through the tasks until the new year.
The next match is on Wednesday, during the English week, with a away game at Borussia Monchengladbach (18.30, Sky).
I receive the mail but my package is returned to me due to a mistake.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and hang up, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is back and the order can be renewed?
Unfortunately, I will not be able to make it because it has already taken a long time.
Are you already sitting on the #PRS_ORG# stage?
Defenders of women's handball team face Spain in quarter final
After defeating Denmark, Germany's women's handball team clings to their heads in defeat and leaves the park with a bang.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB team selection scored a narrow defeat at 16.32 (8.13) before 800 spectators in Granollers and will now have to face Spain in the quarter finals.
We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent, said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to play against Spain differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany lost the lead group III with 8-2 points behind the Danes (10-0).
It's sad that we couldn't take the flow.
It was one of the worst games we have to play, captain Emily Bölk said.
In the fight for a place in the semi-final, they will have to show a definite improvement on Tuesday against the 2019 World Cup runners-up.
The best German swimmer in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Alina Grijseels, who is a reserve player.
We were not there just yet - neither in attack, nor in defense, conceded Xenia Smits, and she demanded, "We must now look to the future quickly."
Not even at the height
The German team was not as strong as in the previous five tournaments.
Foul play and technical errors in attack and defense led to a quick 0-4 defeat after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately put on work temperature and prevented serious accidents with a few parades.
The first goal came for the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully scored a quick counterattack.
However, the hoped-for initial spark was not there.
The German women could hardly stand up to the aggressive defense of the Danes - and when they did, they mostly hit the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the game ended in the 3-10 after 20 minutes, when midfielder Mia Zschocke saw red for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter finals, however, she can make a comeback.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get better into the game and by the break at least five goals.
After only seven minutes, at 9:19, there was already hope without a change.
Once again, the Green protectors in all areas slandered and made it easy for the good-fighting opponent, who is counting on him for the final, to win.
As a result, the German team could not increase its performance and went as a clear loser from the park.
Day 6 of the Advent calendar: Family traditions during Christmas
As part of the Reddit event calendar, we celebrated the Nikolaustag and took it as an opportunity to honour our family traditions in the run-up to Christmas, Advent, Nikolaus, Christmas Eve and New Year's Day.
What was it like at home then?
How about their partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the best for the children?
The staircase?
Shrubbery?
Tree branches?
Will it be muzzled?
Is the Christmas man, Christkind, or is the present from Oma and Opa?
Just like how she makes everyone give in and have fun around Christmas, it is so beautiful to have a family.
Whether this is a firm tradition, or even something that happens every year: tell us how it happened in your family!
Could you please send me any transaction number? or otherwise what could help
Confirmation of transfer... etc
I would like to get a good code
just like #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Does that apply to them?
The title says it all: I am an emergency doctor in mobile teams, where (so far) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered in protective coverings.
Since most of these are already finished to a large extent, I will go to the gym for a while.
I am happy to answer questions about the organisational and human aspects as well as medical issues, if they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, does that conflict with the vaccination?").
In my area of competence, the indication for the vaccination, the prescription (the person has a claim to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination order and no grounds that apply), the medical documentation and, above all, the emergency provision for allergic reactions (which has never happened to me)
The injection itself is delegable to qualified personnel, for example medical assistants.
In Impfteams, however, we do not often have access to them, but only to (to God’s will, no lack of appreciation!) pharmacologically technical assistants for preparing infusion solutions, which however cannot induce infusions (can they?), so I can also perform most of my infusions there.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "hunter"?
With this dialect word, sent from an Amberger, the "We're in Bayern" broadcast for thought-provoking discussions was made.
But differently from many other days, the concept remained in the series "host me?" this time from the guests.
No, it was not a "man who is nervous".
And also none of the "everything has to be done quickly".
That is completely wrong, people from the TV host heard.
Where the man from Amberg got the solution and thus probably also caused surprise in many upper Palatinate.
The Huidlerer, as the spectators call it, is a cloth with which someone extinguishes the fireplace.
The dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bavarian TV for years, confirmed this.
With the comment that this is a typical term from Upper Palatinate, accompanied by the word "Houdern", which is rather well known.
Why was a training gap closed - probably also for some people who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I can't buy books anymore for two weeks.
After confirming the next error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# with the PC, synchronised and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Reifenwahl bei Rennrad - wirklich so pannensicher?
Tomorrow morning I am full of energy because I want to train a little bit for my bike tour in the coming week.
I mean, I did it, and I rode my bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40 kilometers were also really nice - but then it happened what happened in every inner city (this time: Thank you Krefeld!)
Glass splitter on the track.
Zack, with a smile and a hint of my back, wanted to leave the rest of the track to no one in any case.
Since I had no real chance of carrying out maintenance and repairs due to the day of the week, I had to turn around and take the slowest train home.
Technically it was not so bad, maybe it is even better if I practice again with the change of gear before the cycling tour.
Now I am facing a question and hope that you can help me.
As I have a relatively long stretch over several days ahead of me, I often get extremely bored with this problem.
Now we are really not in the mood for it, because the old tyres of the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had ridden his bike 120 kilometers on the day I bought it!) and the one he also described as suboptimal, because it has been running on them for many years.
But if I think about it, I have to make a gear change at 80-90 km/h, then I really look bad:D
Now I'm talking to an older man on the train who asked why I didn't run the Marathon Plus; they should be unbeatable.
Now the whole thing sounds very promising.
But are these really so unbreakable?
I don't want to spend 40 euros just to be disappointed afterwards.
I continue to ask: I believe I am currently on the track at 25x622.
There is also (apparently) a Marathon Plus, but the majority is already broader.
Is this a problem?
Or would you rather bet on me to win at racing?
The rubber side seems to me absolute! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you once again for your help and love!
Car ploughs into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed his car on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, against a median, for an undetermined reason, and then got out on the wrong side of the road, police said.
There, it came to a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The car of the 53-year-old was then driven into a tree and the man in the car was locked in.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old driver were seriously injured in the accident and taken to hospital.

After the publication of our new high-end broadcaster B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series also received follow-ups.
The new Sprössling, called SOLO 15, is reminiscent of the B 200 in terms of optical size.
However, in this building plan, a suitable design foot is directly incorporated to adjust the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted to the length of the room.
The SOLO 15 is very well suited to people for whom the maximum sound level plays a rather subordinate role, but should reach an exceptionally high level of sound.
It is simply not possible for a 10 cm speaker to generate such huge amounts of sound pressure.
However, the SOLO 15 does not sound weak.
On the other hand, she is very mature and impresses by her size.
The SOLO 15 was unanimously approved with a slight increase in tone.
This is generally how broadband providers optimize their network for high frequencies.
Almost at the sound of the horn, the SOLO 15 won over with its very clear and powerful sound.
The upper part of the town can be accessed more easily, and the soundscape can be shaped to sound more warm.
Thanks to the sound source, the positioning of the individual components of a piece of music is optimal, clear and vividly precise.
The suspected extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM generate a hostile dynamic that it seeks.
The SOLO 15, therefore, not only completes our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of suction power and accuracy.
At the beginning, it is recommended to think about the final optical design of the speaker in order to make corresponding changes to the construction.
If you want to furnish the house, the speaker's cable has to be cut accordingly, as the furnace is once again loading material.
After all the disks have been cut (e.g. in the tree market), you should first bore a 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the corresponding position so that you can easily pass the cable through it later.
With the help of an overhang, the speakers in the front can now be opened, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
The opening is to be angled at 45 degrees to allow as much space as possible for the speakers in the interior.
The four clamping points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive an interruption in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
Then you start to build the box itself, and place one of the side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
These are now covered by the return flap, the hood, the front and the floor.
The three engines should also be used and decommissioned.
The shelves themselves can be varied in material strength if required, for example if you want to take advantage of finished goods from the home improvement store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
The second page will be presented in the next work step.
Then follow all the records of the shoe, that is, the two sides and the front.
With the help of a suitable telescopic pole or a forestry auger, the opening of the bass reflex port and the connection cable to the back wall can be facilitated.
After that, you use a brush to clean all the corners of the actual box.
The surface of the shoe can also be made smoother.
In the process, the shoe is fastened to the floor with the shoe of the house and, in addition, covered with long nails.
It follows the marking and preparing (2.5 mm holes) of the mounting points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connecting pieces.
After the house of wood was cleaned (sweeping / mopping), the next step is to move the cab.
This is achieved most simply by opening the 35 mm bass reflex port in the back.
In doing so, the entire and uncut cable is threaded through the 8 mm bore in the boot until the opening of the terminal and allows it to hang up to 30 cm.
In the upper part of the house, the cable leads to the speaker opening and can also be easily hung there.
Next, the frequency is prepared and used.
The frequency plan and the corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document: Montage Anleitung Weiche Solo 15
If the frequency converter is built in and the disconnecting terminal is hidden, the opening of the 8 mm cable in the inner part of the box will be left as is, which is not completely sealed yet.
With the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and a bit of magic, you can slide the ice cream cone to the opening and close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, you can check the discharge accordingly.
Now follows the attack according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and fixed with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus lead (marked cable) must be connected to the plus pole of the speaker (greater contact).
At the end, the bass reflex horn is cut and fitted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the cable).
To combat this, a mattress of the fighting material is divided into two parts and put in a locker in the house.
The opening of the bass reflex channel should be kept.
Can I submit a request now and only deliver it at the beginning of June?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will also be holding the OSCAST this year!
Unfortunately, due to well-known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and a shorter deadline for the announcement.
ABER. There will be at least three people in each studio, so we can follow the Oscars 2021 live with at least 7 awards and hopefully thousands more for you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - and we're still going to give you the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
It will take about 0:30.
If you feel like drinks are getting cold, planning a good meal and making you ready for a long, but very interesting night.
