浙大学术年会上学生唱主角 Research results will open up your mind - Xinhuanet
Wash your hands with air, sniff to judge the disease, and precisely locate the source of the haze. Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Year Meeting of the University of Zhejiang, a series of brilliant academic achievements were awarded.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. The research covers a wide range of environmental, mechanical, energy, medical, life science, and humanities education. From a curious idea, students have created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won domestic and international awards.
Bio-sensors: Your family doctor
The team of Zhang Di Ming, a PhD student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smart phone-based bio sensor on the spot, which is only half the size of a smart phone.
You only need to breathe gently, and the equipment can preliminarily detect your health condition from the composition of your exhaled gas.
Zhang Di Ming said that this sensor is connected to the smart phone and the health report will be shown on the phone when the gas is called out.
On the market, smart rings that can test health conditions generally test physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This bio-sensor uses graphene, a new material, to detect chemical elements. Its "smell" is sensitive enough to reflect the health condition more deeply and accurately.
Intelligent surgery light: The high energy eyes of doctors
In addition to smart phones, smart operation lights are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won the silver medal at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
The team of PhD student Zhu Linping and Xu Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened a new approach based on the defects of traditional surgery lights and invented an intelligent LED surgery invisible light.
Many diseases cannot be detected early and excised improperly because of the use of doctors' operating rooms.
For example, when the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time during the early cancer examination, the cancer cells will still spread, said Xu Junfei.
This intelligent surgery light has four light plates, and can enhance the distinction between different tissues under the light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and invisibility of the light spot according to the needs of the operation and the personal habits at any time.
This intelligent surgery light has been used in hospitals such as the Shao Yifu Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical School and the Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical School, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Clean your hands with air: save water and be cool
For ordinary people, washing their hands with water is enough, and they can only use soap and hand sanitizer to clean their hands. However, some classmates such as Li Zhengang have invented an "airless hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the device's hand basin, our weight can compress the air.
It was like a gas can.
The compressed air forms a liquid at the faucet and combines with water.
So, we can wash our hands cleanly! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiment proved that the effect of this method is the same as that of the ordinary method of hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can guarantee the cleaning degree and save 90% of the water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, in the second Global Major Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among many world-class universities and won the only gold award.

One of the most meaningful certificates - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the skills certificates I think is important besides driving license!
普及一下： emergency measures are actually emergency rescue when there is a sudden event, that is, before the arrival of the ambulance.
It is well known that there is actually a period of time when the ambulance came after the accident, and it is precisely this period that is the most critical.
At this time, emergency treatment is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, stroke, and sudden death, our life window is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it is so important for people around you to know how to perform CPR!
When someone we know is down, we can use the knowledge we have to help them, rather than just standing there helplessly doing nothing, which is too awful to feel.
In China, we have three million accidental deaths every year, and the most dangerous is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, on average, 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas casinos and hotels, 70% can be saved, and Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%."
This is what founder Lu Le said.
If a person has a heart attack, the breath is gone, the heartbeat is gone, and you have no effect on the人中.
It is impossible to save the person without artificial respiration and chest compressions.
I found that there are still few people who have such consciousness to learn CPR, but it is too late when things happen, so I still appeal to everyone to learn this skill, so that we can react in time when facing emergencies.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
The emergency permit can be applied for at your local Red Cross training center. I applied at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. There is a discount for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals before the age of 25, and adding the emergency permit to the list of goals is a few months ago, but it is really done!
Then we have to take other certificates that we want to take. We plan to take a scuba diving certificate. I saw on the small red book that there is also a scuba diving first aid certificate. It seems that you have to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate. So in fact, the first aid certificate is very useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER#

First of all, I would like to come to a conclusion. In my opinion, "The Four Seas" is a comprehensive failure in all senses.
But if you say that the movie is not a highlight, it is not at least the score is good.
There are many kinds of bad films, some of which can make you fall asleep in the cinema, and some of which can make you furious after watching the film. For the audience,四海 is like a monkey on Mount Everest. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han寒 is truly gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation of Kafka's novels, difficult to describe and with many holes like the lapel of a small Macao.
Even after you have watched it, you will doubt whether there is an implicit metaphor hidden in it, but when you think carefully, you will find that it is actually a lump of shit.
First of all, I have a hard time understanding some scenes.
The main character's residence should be on a small island in the south of the country, where he lives with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and the drama was arranged so that a big uncle drove a small面包 car to take her to the north to see snow.
The elderly man sat in the bread truck from south to north to see the snow?
He and his father are still very confident.
Then the old man lost his way.
To open a hotel on the abandoned ship, how did the sister-in-law get the business license?
Why was it so easy for the gang on the island to block a mountain road?
Then the truck with钢筋 in the middle of the road stopped at the edge of the road, and the truck driver was not found at all.
This feeling is also too obvious.
Why was a small troublemaker with poor credit and suspected illegal behavior a deputy police?
Why did the policeman not call the police in the movie?
An adult who knows how to use a smart phone but doesn't know how to open the door with a hotel key and force himself to sleep in the doorway for a night?
This inexplicable situation is full of the whole film, and because the situation is too strange, I will feel pain when I recall it.
In addition to the plot, what is even worse is the movie's theme, or that the movie doesn't have a theme at all, a monstrous stitch-up.
At the beginning of the film, you may think that he wants to make a comedy film, and after more than 20 minutes, you may guess that it may be a motivational film, and after half of the film, you may think that it may be a film that reflects the hard life of the small town youth, and after watching the film, you do not know what you have seen at all, which leads to deep doubts about yourself, and why do we want to go to the cinema to watch the poo at this time of the year?
For most people, in fact, they are very familiar with the tricks of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcycle driver, you can tell the audience a talented rookie how to become successful.
If you want to make a love film, you have to tell the story of the love between the small-town youth who likes to ride motorcycles and the waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot appear things contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that尹正 played was just burnt, and he could still sing the role) he can't go to some places that Kennedy could not stand.
As for the main character, who is not mentally retarded in some aspects but acts like a five-year-old child, I don't know if this is due to acting or the director's requirements.
There is also one thing I don't get, why is it that as a racing driver,韩寒 is so enthusiastic about adding crash scenes in his own movies?
Such a movie arrangement in the New Year period, is it to cause trouble for the audience?

Production and processing equipment of concrete modules of inspection well Shaanxi well wall brick modules introduction:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a professional manufacturer of concrete inspection shaft module brick machine equipment, inspection shaft brick machine equipment, and shaft wall module machine modules in China. From semi-automatic to fully automatic production lines.
Through years of practice and development, it is now capable of producing high-quality, main hydraulic, mobile and fully automatic inspection well series equipment and associated equipment.
Production and processing equipment of concrete modules of inspection well:
Production and processing equipment of concrete module of inspection well Shaanxi well wall brick module characteristics and advantages:
The equipment of the brick machine of the inspection well of Yixin is widely used in the new type of construction materials for coal, heat, water, electricity, gas and other municipal underground structures.
For example: inspection wells, rainwater pipes, square wells, sewage tanks and small structures, and bridge wings.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the module is made up of a series of concave and convex cavities, which can be assembled to form a chain link.
The tensile strength of the wall of the well is far better than that of the friction-built wall.
The module is a hollow structure, and when it is assembled, the holes in the vertical direction are connected, and the holes in the horizontal direction are continuous. After the core of the hole is cast, a mesh-like concrete structure is formed, which plays a role in reinforcing and waterproofing.
The modules are set with studs in both directions, and the studs in the horizontal direction and the studs in the vertical direction are correspondingly increased to improve the overall strength of the structure.
The inspection well and drainage well made of concrete inspection well modules are less likely to collapse, sink and leak. The mechanical properties of the well wall and body modules are stable, the operation is simple and the molding size is standard.
Concrete inspection shaft module brick machine equipment intelligent control equipped with data input and output device, one-key touch LCD display monitoring the mechanical operation of the whole process, realizing the ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material, density operation, safe logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical and hydraulic system of the wall of the well is single cylinder hydraulic and conveying, double cylinder hydraulic and conveying.
An independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the influence of vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection shaft module brick machine equipment distribution box moving mold box de-molding lifting, storage box door closing, automatic transporting plinth, all of them are independently completed by hydraulic system, so as to reduce mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection shaft module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers and electrical appliances, sealing parts and hydraulic parts, and ensures the stability and reliability of the overall performance of the equipment.
The mechanical vibration platform of the well wall and wall body modules adopts whole plate steel, the cutting line of the table is without welding points, so that the filler box is free to swing to guide, so that the mechanical wear is fully reduced.
The load on the mold is reduced, the packing is combined and the amplitude is encrypted, and the molding is done in an integrated and all-synchronous way, the vibration of the mold and the vibration of the mold are ensured to achieve the effect of compaction.
The mechanical excitation of the wall module of the well is controlled automatically by the computer. The amplitude of the vibration is adjusted according to the cost-effectiveness of the raw materials. The frictionless braking can extend the service life and reduce the cost.
The mechanical automatic control and manual control of the wall structure module are dual functions.
Check well cases:
The inspection well of Yixin brick machine is made of cement bricks:

South African doctor: Omikron's contagiousness is strong, but most are mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Covid variant Aomijong are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although the transmission speed is faster.
According to the Associated Press, a group of more than 5,000 doctors who formed a medical organization in a province in Hertogenbosch, South Africa, said that the symptoms of the coronavirus patients they were treating at present were relatively mild, such as body pain and cough, which were similar to those of the flu.
The director of the organization, Unben Pillay, said that he saw dozens of patients every day, but there were no patients who needed hospitalization.
P莱说 ： “They can control the disease at home. Most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation. ”
He said it included elderly patients and those with health problems who are more likely to fall into a critical condition due to the coronavirus infection.
He said that compared with it, in the last wave of Deltas, he treated Covid-19 patients, their breathing was difficult and their oxygen level was low.
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days. "
In the two weeks after the first report of the Omegle variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although collecting enough data will take several weeks, the doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the conclusions of the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases: In recent weeks, only 30% of the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were severe illnesses, half of the proportion of severe illnesses in the previous wave; the average hospitalization time was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; in recent patients with COVID-19, only 3% died, and in cases of early outbreak in South Africa, the death ratio was 20%.
The head of the African Health Institute, Willem Hanekom, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, saying, "At present, almost all signs indicate that it is a mild disease."
He also said: “We are still in the early stage. We need to get late data.
In general, the time of hospitalization and death is late, and we only entered this wave of epidemic for two weeks. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although the Delta variant is still the main strain of COVID-19 in the world, outbreaks have been reported in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicenter of the pandemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases in Hertfordshire increased by 400% in the first week of December, and tests showed that the cases of Omicron variants accounted for more than 90%.

Education commentary: What does it take to save the children who have been abducted?
If we compare the famous publicity slogan "Without trading, there is no killing," then in a good environment where there is no demand for "trafficking", the prevention and control by the masses and the whole people, and the crime of "trafficking" are profitable, risky and costly. Such crimes will not be committed repeatedly.
Recently, the Children's Missing Information Emergency Release Platform of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform established to establish an authority channel for the release of children's missing information and to find missing children in a timely manner.
After hearing the name of the App "Group reunion", I felt very warm.
New technologies and means not only have the name of "art" and are full of feelings, but also use information effectively and are practical and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement against human trafficking is to find the children who have been trafficked and to protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be cited in many "big words."
However, before the trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the safety of the victim.
It is important to weigh the importance and urgency of the issue. Under the urgent purpose of "searching for rescue", such as "whether the sale of children should be sentenced to death", which is a controversial topic with a large number of opinions and disputes, it can be put aside for careful discussion; but the rescue of abused children cannot be put off.
According to the experience of the investigation of such cases, human traffickers are apt to move away from the scene of the crime as soon as possible after the accomplishment of the crime.
Any delay in the search will take one minute, which will make the child further away from the parents. The difficulty of the investigation will increase by one point.
In such a case, taking out such a direct effective way as "Group reunion" platform to help solve the case and find the child, is really a pragmatic action.
In the end, it is a big task to "defend children" to operate the entire legal system.
To fight crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, it is not only necessary to improve legislation, but also to guarantee judicial protection and law enforcement precision.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking from family to society can be done better.
For example, a family of three was resting at the station. The parents were sleeping and they woke up to find that their child had disappeared.
It is not possible to expect a two-year-old child to have the necessary self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have the protection awareness.
It is the minimum means to prevent children being abducted.
From the perspective of the police fighting against the sale of children, the other side of buying the children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the minimum sentence for the crime of trafficking in children is five years; if the crime is particularly serious, the sentence can be to death and the property can be confiscated.
The maximum punishment is high and the minimum punishment is low. Under the general trend of "light criminalization", the sale of children is obviously a crime with a relatively heavy punishment.
However, there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have lagged behind in the concept of raising children and are weak in law awareness.
The legal education of this group of people should be synchronously followed up.
To effectively control the trafficking in crime, it is not enough to strictly enforce the law by the authorities.
If the "market" for kidnapping exists widely, the kidnappers will be greedy and constantly innovate kidnapping means to form a "fight" with law enforcement officials, so the operation to fight against kidnapping will inevitably fall into a low efficiency muddle.
Therefore, the eradication of backward concepts, the popularization of legal knowledge, and the rooting out of child trafficking and pawning also help to root out child trafficking and pawning.
Yang Hongdong promulgated the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress and the provincial Party Congress in Macao
汲取奋进力量，从党的百年奋斗史中学习
Hunan Daily, December 10 (reported by Gong Boxwei, full media reporter) According to the unified arrangement of the provincial committee, on the morning of December 10, the deputy secretary of the provincial committee and the press and propaganda minister of the provincial committee Yang Hongdong gave an interactive presentation in the video creative park of Ma'an.

The International Olive Oil Council divides olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil. There are five grades.
初榨橄榄油, also known as natural olive oil, is the oil obtained after the mechanical cold pressing and filtration of fresh olives.
According to the different degrees of acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO): EVOO is the highest grade and quality of olive oil. It is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a pleasant herbal fragrance, and the acidity is not more than 1%.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Fine Virgin): The acidity is slightly higher, but not more than 2%, and the taste is pure and fragrant.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Extra Virgin): The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity is not more than 3.3%.
The refined olive oil refers to the refined olive oil after the acidity exceeds 3.3%. It may become "二次 oil".
The refined olive oil is divided into two grades:
Olive oil (Oil of olives): refined olive oil and a certain proportion of virgin olive oil are mixed to adjust the taste and color. The acidity is less than 1.5%, and the color is transparent and golden yellow.
Refined olive oil or olive pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): Olive oil obtained by dissolving pomace from olive oil and refining.
You should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is an important indicator of classification.
You should know that olives are like grapes when it comes to making wine. Olives from different regions and different olive varieties will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best growing place of olive tree:
The coasts of the Mediterranean Sea have the most suitable soil and climate conditions for the growth of olive trees.
In addition to the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only be planted sparingly in suitable areas.
Major production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, have similar climates to those in the south of the southern hemisphere, such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa.
The olive harvest month:
From March to June every year, olive trees bloom and fruit. From July to October, fruit begins to develop and mature. The fruit changes from green to red, purple, and finally black.
From November to February next year is the harvest season of the fruit (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
The nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, including oleic acid and linoleic acid, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the best oil for human nutrition to date.
Biden says the torch of freedom will never be extinguished at the summit of democracy
The online "Democracy Summit" convened by the President of the United States Joe Biden, attended by governments and leaders of civil society and the private sector from 110 countries, closed on Friday, December 10.
In his closing speech, Biden said that the torch of freedom was burning in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that the tyranny regime could never extinguish it.
He also said that plans to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwan government representative and政务委员唐凤和 is also speaking at the meeting. He is a Hong Kong democracy activist currently residing in Britain.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work before us is.
But we also know that we can meet challenges, because I said before that as this summit has shown, the world of democracy is everywhere.
專制政權永遠無法熄滅自由的微火,它在全世界和世界各地人們的心中燃燒。
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said, "As the leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent accountability governance, and can better resist the power of the buffer and impact of the authoritarianism, as well as those who want to stand naked before the public interest to pursue power. "
The second day of the "Democratic Summit" was dedicated to defending human rights, consolidating democracy and combating authoritarianism, as well as responding to digital authoritarianism and affirming the democratic values.
This day coincides with the International Human Rights Day.
The United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, also said in his opening speech that the cause of democracy is facing challenges all over the world, especially the challenges brought about by new digital technologies.
He said: "This is the time to reaffirm the common values and positions and the resilience of democracy.
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving the problems of inequality, fighting against corruption, updating the social contract, investing in high-quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and children.
This also requires the strong condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technology revolution. "
Through a pre-recorded video, Hong Kong Democratic Human Rights Activist Law Chi-kwong reminded the attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and ethnic minorities such as Uighurs and Tibetans in China.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Luo Qianxun also called on the free world to unite against the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "It is possible that some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, it is possible that some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, it is possible that some of you don't recognize the threat to our democratic values by the Communist Party.
And that's why we failed.
This is also the reason we must change. "
In the round-table discussion on “Struggling against digital tyranny and affirming the value of democracy”, Taiwan’s Secretary of the Executive Yuan, Tang Fei, issued the National Statement via video, stressing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of fighting against tyranny and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience in how to fight the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said, "In the midst of the growing democracy in Taiwan, we will always stand firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the pandemic, various authoritarian governments around the world justified their violations of human rights under the pretext of public health and collective interests. Global democracy appears to be retreating.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to close the city to control the epidemic, nor do we have to remove the fake information to defeat it. "
At the same time as the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the U.S. Treasury announced the imposition of sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea and other countries that have been identified as seriously violating human rights, while imposing investment restrictions on a Chinese company that has been identified as using monitoring technology to help violate human rights.

Hello, the restaurant delivered the raw chicken
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid that I won't be able to stick to it. So I want to find a cheaper price to practice my hands first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often related to the degree of friendliness, and if you can't distinguish, the expensive normal situation is more friendly than the cheap beat, which is actually industrial trash.
Their strength is very low, the ball hits the top of the bat, the vibration is very big, hard balls cannot withstand, and high players are very difficult to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence are that tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, and you know you can't afford to buy the expensive one, so you make a cheap one to糊弄 you. You play it twice, and you won't play it again. This way, the racket is cheap, and you don't care about it.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means that you've made progress. Come here to buy the expensive one when you're ready. I'll make two times of money for you.
It is suggested to buy a second-hand badminton racket at a similar price and choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket cannot be sold at a price. A new racket costs 500 or 600 yuan, and a second-hand one costs 200 yuan. Is it not enjoyable to have a thousand yuan racket?
It is friendly to beginners, but once the beginner stage has passed, it is a waste. However, most people, especially women, cannot pass the beginner stage.
Orders have repeatedly delayed delivery time
Could you help me follow up?

In fact, there are many requirements for the combination of clothes for girls who are slightly fat.
Girls who are fat should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length should be just above the knees. Just enough to cover the fat on the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, the leg fat will be exposed.
Too long will make people feel short and fat.
If you wear it in three parts, it will make you naturally taller. That is, the top, the skirt and the stocking are all in different colors, so it will make you feel like you are growing.
In fact, many dark colors are the standard of thin girls (the author has experienced this). Dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat. The black short dress with noble and elegant style is also the first choice of thin girls.
Wearing dark clothes, especially black skirts, will make you feel slimmer.
If your legs are fat, don't wear so many socks and shoes.
The more popular the better, and the color should not be too bright.
In order to avoid people's attention to your legs and feet, and make people feel fat.
For the slightly obese girl, she must tell the trick of clothing combination.
Girls who are slightly fat should never wear tight skirts. In addition, the tops should not be too short or stuck in the skirts, which will make people feel uncomfortable. If the girls have thighs, they should wear black socks or mesh socks (the kind with small squares). Choose a soft print peplum skirt to wear with a camisole top, which can hide the girls' shortcomings.
Of course, there are some rules to consider when it comes to wearing a short skirt for a petite girl.
If a fat girl wears a short skirt, she should choose a top that matches the color of the short skirt to make her fat body appear taller.
Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs appear longer, which is the most IN summer outfit!
If you are a person who is fat on the top but has thinner legs, you should choose a short dress that is full of style.
It can not only hide the belly, but also show your advantages.
An A-line skirt will make you look slimmer, which is better for girls who are fat. The top should be tight to form layers to make you look slimmer.
Simple white T-shirt and short skirt, fat women can also try.
Small girls are also able to wear fashionable clothes.
As long as you can master the rules of clothing combination, then the little fat girls will also be the focus of attention.
After changing her clothing style, she also practiced more sports in her life to get rid of the label of a little fat girl early.

Girl shot as target for sister's fund-raising campaign: 'It's nothing compared to the pain in my flesh' - Xinhuanet
In front of a big wooden board in the square of Yanlu, Hangzhou, a girl stood, and on the wooden board was written the words "man meat target, ten yuan shot".
Yesterday morning, a picture of a girl from Hangzhou who voluntarily became an "arrow target" and raised money for her sister went viral on Weibo.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a big wooden board in Wulin Square, Hangzhou, with the words "man meat target, 10 yuan arrow" on it, indicating that people can shoot arrows after paying.
The behavior triggered heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the person in charge of publicity of the Police Department of the District of Beichuan of Hangzhou confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed this girl was the sister who had made such extreme actions. However, such actions were not worth promoting. After admonition, this girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl on the Street Arrested for Charity Donation
In the picture leaked online, a girl with long hair stands in a “person” shape in front of a big wooden board with the words “human meat target, ten yuan shot” written on it. Another wooden board written on her bank account and WeChat, Alipay account.
The picture sparked controversy online.
Some netizens believed that this was a "glitzy begging behavior", and many netizens expressed sympathy for this.
We found the situation around the square at around 10 am on the 23rd, when the spectators were already quite a number.
When local media interviewed the police at天水派出所 near the scene of the accident, they said that there were two girls who were selling things in the street, both of whom were young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who was made a "human target" was crying all the time, asking passersby to play this game with her; another girl was at the side helping to yell that her friend's sister had been diagnosed with leukemia and needed the operation expenses, so please help her.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's treatment for leukemia.
Yesterday night, the publicity manager of the police branch of Hangzhou City told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Jijali, and is collecting donations for her sister Jijiayi.
However, because treatment still requires more than 30,000 yuan, it was not easy to find a good way to raise funds at that time, so it made such a behavior.
He said that in the whole process, the two girls were both the target and the helper, but they did not participate in it. No one shot the arrow in the whole process, and only someone took pictures and posted them on Twitter.
After the police used the bow and arrow, it was determined that it was not within the scope of the control.
The person in charge said, "It is not recommended to adopt this kind of eye-catching fundraising method."
After being warned by the police station, she has left the police station.

However, the price is quite high and the logistics is quite fast. I will come back and give a review after using it for a while.

What is the hottest in 2021?
It is certain that the Tokyo Olympic Games.
You think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
There was a very popular article, "Quick! Project managers can hit the gold medal at the Olympic Games", which mentioned that on many projects, project managers can definitely take the lead and no one can match them: Construction, travel, and staying up late are the daily tasks of project managers, and firefighting, taking the blame, and apologizing are nothing at all.
Although it seems to be a joke, it also reveals the daily hardships of project managers. Behind it is the inability to cope with the current project management work.
Those working on project management are also gradually choosing some actions to get rid of their working difficulties.
From the perspective of the increasing number of applicants for the PMP (Professional Certification in Project Management), more and more project management practitioners have learned to improve their project management ability through learning.
According to the "Report on the Development of Project Management in China (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® candidates in China was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified people was about 42 million, and the number of effective PMP® holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders in the world.
In the past decade, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer acceptable to rely on the simple reproduction of the "old experience". The fast-changing working environment makes us know that we need to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP guarantee the smooth operation of the project management?
Many project management beginners said that by learning the related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the relevant knowledge points of the ten fields and five process groups of project management, but when they actually carry out the project management work, they are still a little confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following questions: The project management knowledge is not enough, the project management is just relying on personal experience, the project management theory is not known how to practice; There is no systematic project management process and system support in the work, the project estimation is not accurate, the controllability and sensitivity are poor, the project is dragged and dragged; The members' division of labor is not clear, the "old hands" in the team do not know how to deal with; The communication between departments is not smooth, and the project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and research and development management for more than 10 years, it has helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other key personnel for research and development, and has won the title of "China Enterprise Research and Development Management Talents Training Demonstration Base" and other honors.
The "Development Project Manager Training Camp" online course This is a way of online fragmented learning. It combines the practical cases and tools of many development-oriented enterprises, helping you master the essential knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and taking you on the advanced road of project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and fewer inputs to promote the training process of project managers and bring high-efficiency operation results for enterprises.
Without any evidence, it is better to take a look at the other students' evaluation of the course first: This course is not only the professional explanation of the course content by the China Tianhong expert team (the former Huawei R&D management team), combined with the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenes of many well-known enterprises.
It provides scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich templates and forms, and helps students apply what they have learned after class.

Credit Suisse advocates rational consumption for consumers ahead of "122" - Economic Observer - A professional economic news website
This year, the nationwide network payment business amounted to RMB 17.77 trillion, a new high compared with previous years.
The variety of discount coupons, as well as the live-streamed product sales, once again grabbed consumers' eyes and made them exclaim that they had benefited. On the one hand, the consumer wave made people sigh that the national consumer power was becoming stronger. On the other hand, it was necessary to cool down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the “Double 12”, China Everbright Financial Services Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “China Everbright”) issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the vast number of users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and to refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, which was 2.04 percentage points higher than in 2019.
On the whole, the performance of Chinese residents in the field of financial consumption is better, but there are still large differences in the aspects of financial behavior and skills. It is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
Financial literacy of elderly people and young people is relatively low, and "old people and young people" will remain the focus of continuous attention of financial education; Nielsen's "China Young People's Debt Situation Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumer Report" show that young people have great potential for consumption, credit consumption has become an important way for consumption to upgrade, and 86.6% of young people are using credit products. Nearly half of the young people have no debt accumulation. Although the young generation overall shows a trend of rational consumption, it is quite different from the external label of "excessive consumption", but some young people do have overconsumption and followup consumption behaviors, which have resulted in a large financial pressure and debt risk, and even cause social problems to gradually increase. Financial enterprises should take the responsibility of social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Everbright has always been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality and friendly services. It advocates consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responds to the call of regulators by taking practical actions to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people.
In the past few years, Everbright has continuously carried out comprehensive and diverse financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and has worked with top domestic universities to launch innovative practice competitions to guide the consumption needs of young people in a rational manner, help them plan their consumption needs rationally, and thus help them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of the 12th day of the second month of the year, JCB reminds all consumers friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and a correct money观, to resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, to avoid affecting the personal credit score and the economic life in the future.
When you make a purchase, you should plan it in advance and pay according to your ability.
If the payment is late, the late payment will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the future purchase of cars, homes and other economic life.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, we should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to whether the relevant institutions are qualified to operate.
In the future, Everbright will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously update and迭代 its financial products to provide consumers with more customized and diverse services that better meet their needs. It will continue to help the public improve their financial knowledge level and help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, so as to become a trusted consumer finance partner for the consumer for life.

Vietnamese People's Daily - Gulf Cooperation Council should face common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stopover includes Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first time Prince Mohammed has visited Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in 2017, which led to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive blockade on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations while having close relations with Iran.
The diplomatic tension seriously affected the internal unity of the Hashemite Kingdom and had a negative impact on the economy of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the routes to Qatar by land, sea and air.
The crisis was resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the countries in the Gulf signed an agreement to move towards "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened the border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are trying to restore relations with Qatar by appointing a new ambassador to the country.
The Gulf Arab countries resolved their differences to restore relations with Qatar in the interests of all countries and regional stability, and in the light of the need to unite in order to face common challenges.
During the visit of Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct road link between two Gulf countries.
The long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel and integration of the supply chain of citizens of the two countries.
Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US$50 billion in Oman, and two countries' enterprises signed 13 cooperative memorandums worth US$30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincided with Iran's negotiations with world powers on a plan to save the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a plan condemned by the Gulf countries for failing to address their concerns about Iran's missile program.
All the Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and regarded Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
All the Gulf countries believe that it is defective not to solve the Iranian missile problem and not to take actions to control Iran's activities in the region.
Under the background that the negotiations between the major countries and Iran failed to meet the wishes of the countries in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted direct negotiations.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that slow down the growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first Gulf Cooperation Council summit since the dispute between some members and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to review the diplomatic achievements that contributed to the resumption of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and propose various measures to make its member countries fully cooperate to address the common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Okay
It is said that the exhaust noise of the new mountain super car is the largest!
This car that our team has brought for you is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship super car of Lamborghini, the Murcielago is the successor model-Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is close to RMB 200,000, and the annual road tax is RMB 10,000, four-wheel drive, why is the LP700 called?
Because it has 700 hp, can you imagine how fast it can go?
That's OK, I don't know. According to the data, acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h takes just 2.9 seconds, which is about the time it takes myvi from 30 km/h to 100 km/h.
The low, thin body, the boastful blade door, the huge intake around the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine concealed under glass, all embodied the Lamborghini style.
There is no need to say too much about the price of the car, you can Google it yourself, and the editor has collected some Google may not give the explanation!
It was too much attention, so everyone was watching, which was uncomfortable!
The cost of 1 km of oil is about RM1 (the owner is not caring)
Practice getting into and out of the car, otherwise it will be awkward (because you won't be able to get out of the car and you'll be stuck in the middle)
The engine sound was too loud, so I suddenly became deaf after getting off. (But it was still very enjoyable)
The car is too big, so it will be very narrow to stop in a common parking space, and I am afraid it will be hit by the neighbor's car when it opens the door!
I feel a little lonely because there are no competitors on the road (this is what I said to myself, it is not related to the car owner, hahaha)
Please do not mistake it, the super car in the video is not for sale, sorry!
If you want to take a video for your car, please contact us!
For more information about cars, visit The Car Guide / People's Automotive Times
It involved a car accident worth millions!
The Bugatti Chiron and the Porsche 911 are well-known to car lovers, Chiron is one of the most expensive super cars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
Yesterday, just a few minutes ago, a million car 911 and a billion super car Chiron were knocked off the road!
The result is reasonable!
Let the university spirit resonate with the era spirit - Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of办学理念 and value pursuit that accumulate over time in the development process of a university. It is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit is of great significance to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, as well as the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the first modern university in the world, the university has carried out a unique mission different from that of other social organizations. For universities in China, the emergence in the autumn of national crisis, its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes in times. The university advocates the value concept of "well-educating the world" and the patriotism of "promoting the country".
At present, the trend of higher education informationization and internationalization is increasingly obvious. Global education competition, scientific and technological competition, and talent competition continue to intensify. As an important “supply side” of higher education, its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the "General Plan for统筹推进世界一流大学和一流学科建设" shows China's confidence and determination to move from a large country of higher education to a powerful country of higher education. At the same time, it also poses higher and更新的 requirements for the development of universities.
How to quickly move up the world rankings and build a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having some gaps, so as to achieve "overtake the curve"?
In addition to confidence in firm goals, path, and capabilities, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the advantage of late development, through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, the learning and借鉴 of the world's leading universities' advanced experience, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and operating quality; second, the advantage of culture, inheritance of the wisdom contained in the accumulation of Chinese civilization in 5,000 years, and the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape a brand, and improve the image; third, the advantage of system, play the advantages of socialism in a socialist country, strengthen the drive of goals, gather consensus strength, optimize resource allocation, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
It is particularly important to realize that the construction of a world-class university cannot be done in a uniform way. While each school plays its advantages, it must also show its personality and characteristics.
The characteristics of the school should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique target positioning, educational traditions and resource禀赋 of each school.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we emphasize the following three aspects in our education: First, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative entrepreneurship talents, build an integrated educational environment combining science and education, and form an entrepreneurial education ecosystem along the entire chain; Second, we emphasize the characteristics of cross-disciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create a system environment of cross-disciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate emerging cross-disciplinary disciplines and landmark cross-disciplinary achievements; Third, we emphasize the characteristics of the educational system and social service, carry out in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of the production and research cooperation system of Zhejiang University.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit, so that the university spirit resonates with the times.
For the University of Zhejiang, the school motto, “Searching for Truth and Innovation”, the common values such as “studying diligently, cultivating virtue, being enlightened, and being honest and practical”, and the common values such as “hearing the sea and opening the heart, accepting the river and deepening the virtue, foreseeing the people and building my country” constitute the latest expression system of the University of Zhejiang’s spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct办学 direction and continuously accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual strength. The connotation is rich and the significance is profound.
Among them, "Henan River" emphasizes openness and inclusiveness, and reflects the concept of "using talent from all over the world", and it also embodies the high-quality concept of taking in the world-renowned education and training of top universities; "啟真厚德" emphasizes the pursuit of truth and the spirit of perfection, and means that the university should accept the cultivation of virtue and personality while pursuing truth; "開物前民" embodies the reform and innovation spirit, which includes the pursuit of knowledge, scientific research innovation, as well as the reform and development,革故鼎新; "樹我邦國" emphasizes the spirit of dedication to the country, and talks about the university's constant association with the nation's destiny.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is the soul of the University of Zhejiang for 120 years.
"Smart people listen to the silent and see the invisible."
China's colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the socialist cause in China, grasp the current situation and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, we must adhere to humanistic care and independence, let the university spirit and the time spirit and national spirit interact, and thus provide endless impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national revitalization and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

At the moment when NFT is rapidly out of the circle, a new concept has emerged in the cryptocurrency community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia. Some residents who lost their jobs because of the epidemic began to get a stable income in this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet养成 game based on blockchain technology. It brings together a variety of NFT games and is currently the highest trading volume NFT project. Up to now, it has exceeded 30 billion US dollars.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's income exceeded 8.2 million US dollars a day, nearly as much as that of王者荣耀.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity said that its daily active users had exceeded 100,000.
The fever of the game "Axie Infinity" has transmitted a new "palytoearn" mode to more people, and with the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role, but can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This main body does not come from the game maker, but from the blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about the stock price of a friend, my biggest impression is the choice of the enterprise on the road, that is, the choice of the investment target industry. First, it should choose the industry with large growth space, at least 100 billion market size. Second, it should choose the industry with good growth in the future, and consider the industry with the best growth state in the future 3 to 5 years. Finally, it should choose the industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market scale, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, the flatness of the track refers to the competition pattern of the industry.
加油 for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The key is to "do the things right," that is, to do things correctly.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find the direction, and the tactics are to land. On top of most tactical thinking, there is space for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking) above, you can think about whether to continue deepening in the current field or expand horizontally in the strategic field (strategic thinking); how to improve the customer retention rate (tactical thinking) above, you can think about how to improve the customer retention rate of core customers and high-value customers; how to improve the participation rate of activities (tactical thinking) above, you can think about setting the correct activity KPI to achieve the correct activity goal, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating the participation of high-value silent customers, and precisely attracting new customers; on the increase of DAU (tactical thinking) above, you can think whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.

Asian-American groups file complaints against 3 Ivy League universities for discrimination in admissions - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) On the 23rd, more than 130 Asian groups in the United States filed an appeal to the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice to protest the discrimination of three Ivy League universities in the admissions process: Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Education Alliance, which initiated the appeal, held a press conference in Washington that day.
The chairman of the group, Zhao Yu空, said at the conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the requirements of American universities has increased exponentially, but the proportion of Asian applicants in these three American universities has basically remained the same.
Many studies have shown that these universities in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" recruitment process, "long-term persistent and systematic discrimination against Asian students."
Zhao Yu空 introduced that, in 2014, the research of Sanders and other scholars showed that among these three universities, the enrollment rate of Asian people was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rates for Asian students, and the University of Yale and Brown University have actually implemented racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yu空 told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they expected the US Department of Education and the Justice Department to investigate after the appeal is submitted and take measures to stop these colleges and universities from discriminating against Asian students after they have identified facts.
They also expect the schools to take the initiative to address the issue and change their admissions policies towards Asian students.
At present, the three schools of complaints have not responded.
The Asian Education Alliance was founded in 2015. At the time, it complained about Harvard University's discrimination in admissions. However, the US Department of Education rejected the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to American Chinese groups that participated in the appeal, there were American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani education groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory from a housing intermediary. After several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In the same month of December, Mr. Lu consulted with Lin, the family member of the property owner, and paid 20,000 yuan as a deposit via bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payer on the "Acknowledgement for Purchase and Sale of Building Facilities", which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy the building facilities, the deposit is returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell the building facilities, the deposit will be doubled returned to the seller. Both sides agreed to sign the contract of building facilities within a week."
However, after the failure to reach an agreement on major contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, the house sale contract was still not signed.
Considering that neither side could reach an agreement on the content of the contract, Mr. Lin returned the 20,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
After hard work, he finally found a house that he liked. However, when he paid the deposit and was ready to sign the contract, the seller refused to sell. This made Mr. Lu frustrated and angry.
In order to do this, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yiwu Municipal People's Court.
After deliberation, the court concluded that the two parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract. It cannot be solely attributed to the defendant. It should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed, so this case should not be applied to the deposit penalty. The defendant should not bear the default responsibility of double returning the deposit.
After the verdict, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the second trial court upheld the original verdict.
The lawyer reminded: In the process of the transaction, it is necessary to perform the duty of prudent attention.
At the signing of the contract, as the buyer, you should perform the necessary cautionary duty, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the house is occupied, and so on, and clarify in the contract the specific time and place of delivery to prevent disputes during the performance of the contract.
(Reporters Voice of China) After the "Democratic Summit" ended on Friday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement on Saturday (December 11) saying that the United States held the "leading people’s summit" in order to "divide people on the basis of ideology, to weaponize democracy and to practice a pseudo-democracy in the name of it, to stir up conflict and to divert domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for many years, the United States has imposed its political system and value理念 on others and carried out 'democratic transformation', imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolution', causing catastrophic consequences.
Democracy has long been a "major weapon" used by the United States to intervene in other countries.
This summit is a move by Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was held in video format, with the participation of leaders from 111 countries, including the leaders of Taiwan. However, China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States over its own democratic problems, saying that the United States did not have the资格 to chair such a summit.
There are also doubts in the international community and in the United States. For example, some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of Philippines, Poland and Brazil, were criticized for being invited and participating in the meeting. Some people doubt that the true intention of the Biden administration is not to organize the meeting for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly-elected German Chancellor Merkel also participated in the Video Democracy Summit
In a statement on Saturday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said, "The American form of democracy is full of abnormalities today. The issues of money politics, identity politics, party rivalry, political polarization, social division, racial contradictions, and the polarization of the rich and the poor are intensifying." The American democracy is based on the foundation of "rich people's game."
In his speech, the President of the United States Joe Biden said, "As the leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent accountability governance, and can better resist the strength of the buffer and impact of the power of the authoritarianism, as well as those who want to stand naked before the public interest to pursue power. "
He stressed that democracy is not a matter of chance, "we must renew it in every generation, and in my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our era."
Biden also said that democracy and human rights need fighters to defend "when the world is facing persistent and worrying challenges."
The United States pledged to carry out a one-year action after the democratic summit, including an initiative worth $4.244 billion to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that all countries will make concrete commitments before the planned实体民主峰会 in 2022 to improve their democratic systems.
Biden said, "Let's make every country in the world implement our commitments and report our progress next year."
Okay, I am afraid that he has mistaken the address

The dry and wet degree of the煲仔饭 is just right, and the amount is very abundant. The famous锡纸 chicken wings are as good as before. The broth is also good. The mustard greens are also handled well...
The taste is good, the service is warm, and the meat is good.
It's been a long time since I last visited the Hanjin store. It must have been the existence of an Internet celebrity a long time ago. The Dongsheng building, with its wooden floor.
We always have to wait a long time before we can eat the steamed rice, and the rice cooker cracked...
It's been a few years since we last ate at Hakka, and the rise of small restaurants of Cantonese cuisine has disrupted the flow of customers.
It is rare to find a restaurant that has seating when you arrive. The quality of the food is excellent, as always.
The taste is good, the meat is good, the main food is good.
Takeaway from Japan.
Meal: This time, the food was a little disappointing.
Three cups of chicken soup: The vegetables are a bit too much, and the chicken is a bit too little.

What is the drink method of the red liquor?
Every person's hobby is different. Some people like collecting, some people like eating, and of course, some people like tasting wine. Red Label Whisky is one of the most popular Scottish whiskies in all countries. And Red Label Whisky has won the gold medal at the international liquor competition.
Each bottle of red label whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, it would be a waste of its sweetness.
How to drink red liquor?
Here is a brief introduction for you.
The drinking method of red liquor whisky:
The Red Label威士忌 is made from about 35 types of Scottish whisky and has a rich aroma and characteristics of traditional Scottish whisky. The aroma is rich and sweet, with a smoky aroma.
The entrance is rich and fresh, with a slight flavor of vanilla and strong smoke flavor.
The wine can be drunk directly with ice, or mixed with the favorite drink.
Red Label whiskey entering the domestic market, in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, Red Label whiskey + cola or soda or new奇士 etc. have become a fashionable drink.
These sweet drinks can not only neutralize the acidity, but also bring pleasure to the eyes. Add drinks, which can dilute the alcohol taste and change the taste.
The most authentic and traditional way to drink whiskey with a red label, sliced lemon, and sugar (brown sugar is also acceptable).
The authentic red box wine has a slightly acidic taste. Add sugar to neutralize the acidity, and lemon gives the wine a refreshing aroma. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to the personal taste.
These three are the best ways to drink red whiskey. You can try them as references. Hope my introduction can help you.
Education Thoughts: How University Tests Make "Academic Majors" and "Academic Minors" Fit for Purpose - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leaders to express their confusion about the university exams and put forward a proposal to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the test formats and make the exams truly reflect the actual level of students.
In fact, for a long time, university entrance examination has been a "hot" topic.
In the university campus, students come from all over the country, with different levels of ability and different levels of learning, and the learning situation is different.
For a group with such diversified characteristics, it is inevitable to have different feelings for assessment.
Of course, if the test questions have a simple format and a high repetition rate, the questions will inevitably be too easy.
Students who are not diligent may pass the examination by focusing on the examination before the examination. If they think of other ways, they may achieve a better result.
As a result, there is a "怪 situation" where a student who is not diligent can pass the examination and even get a high score; a student who is not diligent is not always absent from class, and his/her homework and notes are all good, so there is no "extraordinary situation" where the examination score is a little high.
In the view of the students of兰州交通大学, the problems in the university examination are not without cause. I believe that this situation is not just the case of兰州交通大学.
In this sense, I would like to applaud these three students who directly wrote letters.
In fact, people who have gone to university know that the phenomenon of突击 studying, thinking of various ways to "get" the test questions from the teachers, and striving to cover the test scope in order to get "special tutoring" before the test is not rare, and even the situation of carrying small notebooks and asking the teacher to lift the hand after the test is not rare.
In my opinion, in terms of the evaluation of teaching quality, it is more about the comprehensive grasp of teachers on teaching and learning, and on this basis, scientific命题.
When entering the college level, the specialty begins to be refined, and many specialty courses are based on basic knowledge.
Without a doubt, whether to fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content of the university examination.
The basic knowledge of undergraduate courses is basically the basic theory and basic常识 of the discipline, and the change of knowledge points is not great, which is basically fixed.
Just as a teacher said, "By learning basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago, I still learn it today, but it is still a priority."
But the basic knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test question type is single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, exams are usually organized into question groups, and then organized into test papers by subject experts. The exam review is also carried out by all teachers in charge of the subject, so that the situation of repeated questions can be somewhat overcome.
But to come up with a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning conditions, the questions should have a normal distribution of difficulty according to the overall situation of student learning, and it is also necessary to comprehensively master the teaching situation, comprehensively analyze the degree of student learning, so that the test命题 can have dynamic grasp of difficulty and question type, so that it can highlight the examination of basic knowledge, but also can take into account the examination of ability, and at the same time, the question type can be innovative design.
The examination is the baton of university education, and what kind of examination a student has will have corresponding preparation plans, which will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The school has attached great importance to the suggestion letter from the students and has put forward a plan to rectify the matter.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out discussions and examinations to compare self-examinations, formulate examination papers and related systems, and at the same time, strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination papers and examinations, clarify the grading, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of courses in all aspects.
From a mechanistic point of view, solving the problems of single type of test questions and repeated questions is a topic that needs to be faced by the university examination authorities. Of course, it is necessary to come up with corresponding systems. However, the more important thing is to master the teaching situation on a daily basis. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only master the content of the teaching, but also the student's learning situation. The two sides should be mastered, so that the teaching and learning can be better docked, forming a benign interaction, and the examination will also be more in line with reality, so that the "top students" and "poor students" can get what they need.

Golden Flower Wedding Photography (South Street Store) Has No分店
Before taking the photo, because we didn't have a good time schedule, we changed the time twice. The advisor, Lan Lan, was very patient and helped us arrange the time.
He chose a good weekend to shoot.
The staff of the Queen’s staff, whether consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are all superb.
It was my first time to make up in a formal way. Wow, I can't believe that I will become so beautiful one day.
Xiao Jie and another girl (sorry, I can't remember the name) are very patient in makeup and makeup is very natural.
The scene was filmed in Jiang Bay City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, so I did not feel very cold. When I was taking photos, the makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes, headpieces, and if there was anything wrong, he would help us fix it immediately.
The photographer is also very humorous, and he feels very happy every day after taking pictures.
When choosing the photos, because I saw many cases on the Internet, I didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we chose the photos, in fact, they didn't mean to add photos. They just took the 24 photos included in the package and didn't take any more (it was said that my younger sister, who took her wedding photos around the same time as me, paid more than 7,000 yuan for the package that included more than 1,000 photos, and I was shocked and afraid that I would choose too many photos at that time)
The photo was fixed today, and Lan Lan sent it to me. I looked at two photos and thought they were not good. They immediately helped me fix them.
I looked at her old photos and compared them with ours, and I think our photos are really perfect. They are simple and fresh, just what I wanted.
I sincerely recommend that you take a wedding photo with Jinghong Golden Lady!
Package price: 3999 yuan
The Queen is grateful for your heartfelt wishes for her to be happy and successful.

Three thousand two hundred new babies in Sabah did not receive birth certificates due to shortage of special birth certificates
(Ipoh, 11 September) The National Registration Bureau of Sarawak said that due to the depletion of specially-designed anti-counterfeit paper stock, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to babies since the beginning of October. Up to 3,200 people have been affected so far.
However, the Director of the Bureau Kalousimius assured that all babies who have applied for birth paper have been recorded in the system. When the anti-counterfeit paper arrives next week, it will be issued again.
In the press conference, he explained the 10-month-long report on the issue of Sarawak newspaper paper printing by a website media.
He said the problem had existed for two months and the砂拉越 was also facing the same problem.
One reason is that the Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeit paper are affected by the epidemic, which delays the arrival of the paper in China.
He explained that the anti-piracy paper used in the newspaper paper of Sabah is different from other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states.
The latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on June 6 and was handed over to the printing company on August 8 for partial printing.
The agency will send people to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and return to Saba immediately for the final printing, which is estimated to take two working days (December 20). "
We will notify the applicants to go to the various branches to collect the newspaper paper. "
He added that Sarawak has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
Waiting for 7 o'clock

I mean food

We will officially declare the completion of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and the realization of the first 100-year奋斗 goals. We will open up a new journey of building a socialist modern country and moving towards the second 100-year奋斗 goals.

This is a political declaration for the Chinese Communist Party to keep their original aspiration and mission in mind and forge ahead in the new era, as well as an action guide for the Chinese nation to realize its great rejuvenation.
Over the past year, the great changes that have not occurred in the world in a century and the global epidemic of COVID-19 have been intertwined and affected. The external environment is more complex and severe. The domestic COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development tasks are very difficult and arduous.
The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core adheres to the overall situation of domestic and foreign affairs, adheres to the overall tone of steady progress in work, calmly handles the changes of the century and the epidemic of the 21st century, coordinates the prevention and control of epidemic with economic and social development, accelerates the construction of a new development pattern, strengthens the cross-cycle regulation of macro-policy, promotes the sustained and healthy development of the economy, and works hard to deepen reform and opening-up innovation, and strives to complete the difficult tasks of reform and development. The Party and the country have made new major achievements in all fields.
The "14th Five-Year Plan" has made a good start. One important aspect is that the construction of a new development pattern has taken a new step and the high-quality development has achieved new results.
China's economic development and epidemic prevention and control have maintained a leading position in the world, and the characteristics of strong development resilience, great potential and strong momentum have continued to emerge; the national strategic scientific and technological forces have accelerated their development, and major innovative achievements have emerged in a bid to improve their scientific and technological innovation capabilities, and key and core technologies have achieved new breakthroughs; the resilience of the industrial chain has been enhanced, and the volume of foreign trade has increased while the quality has improved, and the structure has continued to be optimized; the new momentum represented by new industries, new business models and new modes of competition has grown; the reform and opening up have continued to move forward in depth, and efforts have been made to loosen the bottlenecks that restrict the matching of supply and demand and the movement of factors; the country has built a new competitive advantage by opening up to the outside world at a high level.
These achievements are the result of the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the result of the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping's socialist ideology with Chinese characteristics for a new era, and the result of the efforts of the whole Party and the people of all ethnic groups in the country.
Practice again proved that the Party established Xi Jinping as the core of the CPC Central Committee and the whole Party, established Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era as the guiding position, which had a decisive significance for the development of the Party and the country and for the historical process of promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
With General Secretary Xi Jinping as the core of the Party Central Committee and the core of the whole nation, with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as scientific guidance, with the unity and strong struggle of the whole nation, we will certainly be able to overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles, and create a new era of glory and build a new historical mission on the new journey of building a socialist modern country.
There will be the 20th Party Congress next year. This is a major event in the political life of the Party and the country.
To carry forward the great spirit of founding the Party, to adhere to the overall tone of steady progress, to implement the new development concept in a complete, accurate and comprehensive way, to accelerate the construction of a new development pattern, to comprehensively deepen the reform and opening up, to adhere to the drive of innovation, to promote high-quality development, to take the structural reform of the supply side as the main line, to coordinate the epidemic prevention and control with economic and social development, to coordinate development and safety, and to continue to do a good job in the work of "six stability" and "six protection", to continuously improve people's livelihood, to stabilize the macro economy, to maintain social stability, and to usher in the success of the 20th National Congress of the Party.
Let us more closely unite around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, enhance "four consciousnesses", firmly "four self-confidence", and achieve "two maintenance", continuously improve political judgment, political understanding, and political implementation, implement Party Central Committee decisions and部署 in a practical manner, and continuously push forward the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.

Education Information: Beijing Reduces the Percentage of Special Talents in the First and Middle School in the Early Year of 2016 - Xinhuanet
On the 21st and 22nd, the examination of talent students for primary school admission in Beijing was organized and implemented by the Education Committee of each district.
This year, Beijing's districts have all reduced the proportion of special students, and the competition for special students is more intense.

Bosnian Olympic Committee Chairman: Believes that China is capable of hosting the Winter Olympic Games in a special time - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency Sarajevo, December 11 - Bosnian Olympic Committee Chairman Covic said recently that Bosnia was very eager to host the Beijing Winter Olympics and believed that China was capable of hosting the Winter Olympics in a special time.
Yi Ping, China's ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, met with Croatian Olympic Committee Chairman Covic in Sarajevo Olympic Center.
When meeting with him, Covicic made positive comments on the relations between Poland and China and said that he had visited China at the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008 and had been impressed by the excellent organization work in China. He believed that China was capable of hosting the Winter Olympic Games in a special time. Poland was looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and the Olympic Committee of Bosnia and Herzegovina was actively organizing participants. Poland hoped that this would be an opportunity to carry out more extensive exchanges and cooperation with China in the field of sports.
Zhipoin said that China and Poland have a special "olympic bond."
The 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo successfully held here, and in two months, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open its doors, presenting a simple, safe and wonderful festival to the world.
We look forward to deepening exchanges and cooperation in preparations for winter sports events and athletes' training between our two countries. The Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina hopes to continue to serve as a bridge and use the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote deeper cultural exchanges between our two countries, so that our two peoples can "work together towards the future," and wish our athletes in Bosnia and Herzegovina good luck in Beijing.
Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held an award ceremony for the "tenth Annual Best Athlete", and Ji Ping, as an invited guest, awarded the Best Young Athlete of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The promotional video of Beijing Winter Olympics was played repeatedly at the scene of the event.

The 48-hour negative result of nucleic acid and the establishment of a "buffer zone" require the government to strengthen the prevention and control of epidemic diseases in cities at ports - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporters Ding Ruifeng and Qiu Tiancheng) -- The Government Coordination Mechanism for COVID-19 Prevention and Control recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in cities at land borders, requiring people who have left land border cities in the near future (excluding Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a negative proof of nucleic acid testing within 48 hours, and carrying out at least one nucleic acid test after arriving at land border cities.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the determination of the scope of ports cities in the provinces and cities and the announcement, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that border cities with conditions can study the establishment of epidemic prevention buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
According to the person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic支柱 of the local area. The two sides of the border people are often in frequent contact.
By implementing differentiated management policies for different regions, one control line will be changed into two control lines, which is expected to realize the shift of the control point and reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, so as to achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of localized outbreaks in China, which were all imported from abroad through the port cities.
The above notice points out that these problems expose some problems in the timely monitoring and early warning of the epidemic, the implementation of closed-loop management for personnel at high-risk jobs, the routine testing of nucleic acids, the disinfection and sterilization of cold-chain items at various links, the inadequate management of central isolation facilities, and the inadequate scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that from 9 aspects such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of the port city, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in the port city will be improved, the epidemic prevention and control system in the port city will be improved, and the epidemic prevention and control measures will be implemented, so as to speed up the shortcoming of the epidemic prevention and control in the port city and strengthen the epidemic prevention and control system.
The notice emphasizes that the cities at the ports should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and民生 guarantee work in sync, publish and open up the hotline for guaranteeing the people's livelihood, regularly check the early warning signs and隐患 in the supply and price of basic living goods, and solve and respond to the prominent problems reported by the people in a timely manner.
According to the notice, the border cities referred to include the counties ( cities, districts, and flags) of open land, water, and air ports, the cities (districts, states, and alliances) and cities (districts, states, alliances) referred to in the notice, and the specific scope is determined by the provinces (provinces, autonomous regions, and cities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced timely.

The truth about the bloodthirsty killing of US troops for 20 years - Xinhuanet
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Machine of Death" on the oil pipe platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of how the United States used the pretext of combating terrorism to launch an Afghan war, and forcibly exported American democracy through the war. It has been 20 years since the war and the United States has been ruthless, bloodthirsty and indiscriminately killing innocents. It has committed various crimes against humanity.
The use of drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places of worship distorts human nature and sets up a killing group.
In the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan.
The US military set up "black prison" to inflict various tortures and humiliation on the "accused".
One crime after another against humanity has aroused more hatred in Afghanistan.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorist" war is "anti-terrorist".
The war has not brought peace and democracy, prosperity and hope to the people of Afghanistan. It has brought only the scars of the country and countless killings and destruction.
Watch the video to expose the truth behind the US' so-called "anti-terrorism" campaign of bloodshed and murder, and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I accidentally saw this article from a business point of view and from a storage period point of view, why this customer wants to keep the logistics company in the tax-free zone to do the canning. Although the canning is deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of the tax-free logistics company, this text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many baby food manufacturers and met many baby food production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the canned and bottle milk are the same. There is no difference.
So everyone will definitely ask: Why is the bagged shelf life one year and the bottle shelf life is two years or more?
Or another question: Why is the price difference between the record and the bag so big?
In fact, many consumers or mothers think this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality is better.
In fact, raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
Some consumers also said that the taste or smell of the tincture is different from that of the bottle!
Now I will talk to you about the reason for the high price of the sound. Where is the high price?
Why are the prices so different?
Because most manufacturers take into account the fact that consumers are unlikely to accept a bagged price that is too high when they set the price, which means that the manufacturers generate little profit or none at all, and what does a manufacturer do to survive?
Therefore, in order to guarantee their profit margins, they have increased the price significantly.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote listening, not bags.
And you think that every manufacturer wants to spend a few million or even a few billion on advertising every year, where is the money coming from?
Everyone can understand.
So with the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, such as the promotional personnel of shopping malls, the display costs of shopping malls, the gifts for products, advertising costs, etc. are also increasing.
Therefore, all manufacturers are also increasing the number of new products. They are also listening to the new products. The price is also increasing. In fact, this is the new products that are coming out with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, their raw materials will not cost more than 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands that use all means to promote their products, linking them with doctors in hospitals, and getting them to help promote the products at a profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
The relevant laws of China are absolutely not allowed to carry out such operation methods. In fact, this is a kind of fraud on consumers.
It is suggested that people buy infant formula in bags and put them into containers at home, which can save costs and increase the storage and sealing properties of the formula. There is no effect on babies.
And don't think that the shelf life of the canned food is longer than that of the bagged food. If the canned food and the bagged food have the same shelf life after opening the bag, it is easier for the bagged food to be damp and rotten.
The food was cold, cold, and hard after being delivered late. I couldn't eat it

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhuanet
When you go to the book fair, you often feel the popularity of success books.
Nowadays, many success books promote the best principle - that is, to assume or imply that you can "achieve" and then tell you what you need to achieve "what."
In other words, it bypassed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
For this reason, these books have a common characteristic - either work hard and do your best, or just don't do anything at all; either 100 or 0; either you climb Mount Tianshan, or just stay where you are.
This "optimal principle" will make everyone admit that it is "correctly perfect", but 99% of the people will be scared of the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a "come to a 180-degree change in your life and make a big decision" path, which is the致命 weakness of many people.
For people who are stuck in tradition, stuck in conservatism and refuse change, you are sure to shout at his ear, "I want to change", which is a self-fulfilling prophecy and a pipe dream.
Most people will be cowed by the two words "transformation" and hesitate to move forward, making it difficult to make a decision; or they will make a decision based on their momentary impulses and brave to take the first step, but often the good times will not last long, and they will fall down after a short time because of their determination.
The famous "From tomorrow" sketch by Mr. Ma 3 Li is the most apt expression of this "common humanity".
The biggest problem with the "Best Practices" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the ability limits of ordinary people, making most people "hopelessly disappointed."
Perhaps, the "less is more" principle is a possible way for more ordinary people to take a relatively successful path.
The core of the "less is more principle" is the idea of "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "winning by small successes", that is, if you can't do 100, you can do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tianshan, you can climb the little sand hill at home, too, because that's always better than sticking to your tracks.
In summary, as long as you do something, it is always better than not doing anything.
Since the threshold has been greatly reduced, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to stick to it, and everything that persists will increase the probability of success.
It is just a little bit longer to follow the path of success based on the "less is more principle".
In summary, the "Best Practices", despite its outward appearance of success for everyone, can actually inspire a small number of people; the "Second Best Practices" can effectively inspire more people and make more people benefit.

This year, the amount of raw fish resources in the Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporter: Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxun) The reporter learned from the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results showed that the amount of natural resources of the Qinghai Lake Naked鲤 increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons. Compared with the initial protection in 2002, the cumulative growth has been more than 40 times.
The Naked鲤, also known as "Shanxi fish", is a precious fish species that is unique to the Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the security and biodiversity of the "water - fish - bird" ecosystem chain in the basin of the Qinghai Lake.
In the 1960s and 1970s, affected by factors such as human large-scale hunting and the deterioration of the breeding environment of naked鲤, the number of naked lakes in the Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the resources of Qinghai Lake naked lakes were only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Nakuru flounder was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, the Qinghai Province has implemented the sealing of the lake and the breeding of fish. No unit or collective or individual has been allowed to fish in the Qinghai Lake and the major rivers and tributaries of the lake. No sales of naked鲤 and its products have been allowed.
At the same time, through the measures of artificial increase and release, as well as the cleaning of the main river channels of the Qinghai Lake, as well as the design of scientific and reasonable "overfish passage", the amount of Qinghai Lake Naked鲤 resources is increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that so far, the裸鲤 in the Shaanxi Lake have been stocked with more than 180 million fish, accounting for more than 23% of the recovery of the Shaanxi Lake naked fish resources.
The三江源地区 in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source for China and even Asia. The Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone to control the eastward spread of desertification in western China.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has issued fishing bans in key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake, and built a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river and one lake".

I just saw a piece of writing about menstruation that was too long.
科普 for guys who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period at the age of 13 to 15, and stop menstruating at the age of 50 or so.
After his health is good, he will come regularly every month.
But it is not a rule that can be precisely predicted. About a week of deviation needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes bad luck will also cause the car to fall off (suddenly, it will fall off a few days in advance).
The length of time, blood loss, and the degree of menstrual pain vary from person to person. Some people have it for three days, some for one week; some have less bleeding and some have major hemorrhage; some people have no reaction, some people have a lot of pain and have to be taken away by the ambulance; the pain of menstruation will change over time. It used to be that it was not painful does not mean it will not be painful in the future.
The flow of menstrual blood cannot be controlled, and it can last for a few days from the beginning to the end. What can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to suck blood to prevent it from spilling on the clothes and seats.
The main reason for menstrual pain is the release of prostaglandins, so it is effective to take ibuprofen immediately when the pain begins, but it is not effective to take it again after the pain begins.
In the days before the period, due to the uterine swelling and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to suffer from diarrhea.
If it is about the time of the cycle, suddenly have diarrhea, and basically come the period within two days.
It is best to change the pads for two or three hours at a time, otherwise they will breed bacteria, and the worst case is to change them six times in a day, for seven days in a month, which is 42 pieces, plus the pieces prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces, not one piece every month.
(Here, sanitary pads do not need to be changed often, about 5-6 hours a time, and the longest is 8 hours)
The hormonal changes during the period of menstruation may be more violent, and the mood of the body may be unstable during the period of ovulation. It is very unfortunate. The body is playing tricks on the body.
However, the official crime rate data shows that the ability of women to control emotions is still very high, and they will not find excuses for emotional problems.
Not only is blood flowing, but also the detached uterine tissue.
The endometrium is the thinnest after the menstruation and gradually thickens afterward. It is understandable that the uterus is a house, building a house every month (the endometrium thickens) to prepare for the guests, but the guests do not come, and the house is all dismantled (the menstrual blood is poured out) the next month, and the house is built again and again.
The period is very inconvenient. For decades, there are days of 24 hours of bleeding every month, and there will be stomachache and backache. Who wants that?
But it is thanks to our mothers that we are born. Their period is a preparation for the first ten months of our lives. We should thank our mothers for their regular and healthy period.
In the past, many things done by women were suppressed. The society taught women that they were dirty, shameful, and everyone thought that was how it was. But times have changed.
If someone thinks that menstruation is disgusting and that the body of a woman is prepared for pregnancy, it is not appropriate to say in public, and the girls stand up, do not think like this, have never experienced it, and will never experience it, and are not very familiar with the men, do not be so despicable, how dare you face your mother? How dare you want your child?
Finally, sisters try tampons, they are really good.
Today is the winter solstice festival. It is disappointing to send the wrong one.
Have a separate meal for the kids
I hope that the store will check the product during its busy time
Is it because of the electric leakage that the foot bath is numb?
Choosing a suitable foot bath can play a good role in foot therapy and health care. Today, the State美的编辑 will answer this question and hope to help friends.
With people's increasing awareness of health, foot baths are becoming more and more popular among consumers. There are a large number of foot baths with different prices on the market, ranging from more than 100 yuan to more than 1,000 yuan. This has given consumers great choice space.
On the surface of relevant data, the sales of health-related household appliances such as foot baths are hot, but foot baths do not have a specific industry standard, so there is a certain safety hazard.
In fact, it is too dangerous to soak your feet in a charged water!
Mr. Li told the reporter that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt a numbness in his feet when he was bathing.
Mr. Li initially thought that the vibration function of the foot bath was the cause, but he found that when the vibration function was turned off, his father still felt麻.
Mr. Li tried the pen and the pen lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was charged.
Later, he contacted the merchants, and the merchants were quite good. Although he took out the foot bath basin, Mr. Li was still unhappy.
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation on the setting of the highest temperature, which population is suitable for it, and what materials can guarantee its innocuity.
However, in general, the foot bath basin will not have any problems with electricity. However, it is not excluded that some products are not strictly checked when they are produced.
Therefore, when buying, choose a separate foot bath.
The water and electricity are separated, there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can measure it with a pencil.
The 13th provincial tea fair opened - the front page of view - Hunan Daily Network - Hua Xiang Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (reported by Full Media Reporter Zhang尚武, Huo盼盼, Correspondent Liu Xiaolong and photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Exhibition, as well as the promotion of new-yang tea, was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center. The exhibition showcased the tea industry, innovative tea science and technology, promoted tea culture, and accelerated the goal of building a hundred billion yuan of the tea industry.
Huang Xingfu, deputy director of the Council of the China National Retailer Cooperative Federation, and Yang Hongchun, deputy director of the State Council, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand introduction at the opening ceremony: The source of the lake red is in Xinjiang, and the rise of the red tea has injected new impetus into the "five colors of Hunan tea".
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion-yuan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "six rivers, five colors of tea,"
The tea industry in the province increased innovation, and green tea, black tea, and red tea, etc. worked together to promote the integration of tourism and tea production in the main production areas, so as to increase the income of farmers.
风水轮流转，红茶又发力.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after harvesting green tea, harvesting red tea and black tea, farmers have income all year round, and the output value of the tea field has increased rapidly.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders presented a plaque to the fourth batch of enterprises that have been granted the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark. Xiyang was honored as the "source of the red tea of Hunan".
In the exhibition hall of the red tea of Xing'an, Fujian tea merchants saw a high mountain tea called "Ice Spring in the Snow" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Zheng, secretary general of the provincial tea industry association, said that at present, factors such as the current epidemic and the like affect the tea market to some extent, but from the scene of the tea exposition, there are many highlights.

Philosophy refers to the study of problems that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic rule of philosophy, aimed at explaining the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the name "metaphysics" comes from the phrase "metaphysics" in the first chapter of the "I Ching," which means "metaphysics" in English. It was translated from metaphysics by Japanese井上哲次郎 (明治时代 ).
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and its related problems.
Metaphysics is the "research of what terms represent actual existential entities and what terms only represent a concept".
Formal naturalism, which denies the existence of God.
According to its theoretical foundation, all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, which is proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
The method of naturalism refers to the method of studying God without a word.
Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and their relationship with the body (especially the brain).
Two-元论与一元论 are the two main opinions on the relationship between the soul and the body.
Knowledge论 is a philosophical branch that explores the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic thinking and research on human moral life; here, ethics is defined as the all-pervading behaviors accepted by a group or a culture.
It is mainly divided into the metaphysical ethics (abstractly researching ethical theory or criticizing the essence), the normative ethics (judging various different moral views and giving moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior) and the ethical psychology (investigating the principles of ethics and psychology).
It studies what kind of moral behavior norms people should follow, ethics of application (the academic study of how ethical theories are applied to actual life situations, including biological ethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (the gathering of information on how people live, and summarizing it from observed styles).
The ethics review is not based on the anticipated theory, but investigates the actual moral subject (moral agent) made and observed real choices, which led to all the moral factors of this decision, and it studies the ethical concept held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes ancient Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.
Part 1: Humanist ethics, with Valery and Montaigne as representatives.

I didn't want to go downstairs to buy anything, so I had to spend so much money on delivery
丁子霖: To a friend.
I sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after my relative's death, especially since I issued a call for humanitarian assistance in my personal name to friends abroad and domestically in January 1994. So far, no interruption in assistance.
Nowadays, most of the dead parents of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have also grown up and become employed.
It is your righteous act that has helped us to endure the most difficult time.
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping the globe, and most donors have reached the age of retirement.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to suspend the humanitarian donations to us, the mothers of Tiananmen Square, which is a humanitarian aid that should be put an end to.
I will always remember your love and believe that your deed will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please forgive friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
陶业按： I would like to take this opportunity to introduce the history of the United States National Federation of Chinese Students (IFCSS) and the Minessota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF) engaged in humanitarian aid for 32 years.
In carrying out humanitarian aid, the全美学自联 and the Minessota Chinese Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations. The project executors often have crossovers.
(Apple Daily picture: The mother website of Tiananmen Square is managed by the céramique industry.
The rescue money often cannot be delivered to the people of June 4.
In 1994, under the suggestion of Professor Ding, a special group was set up by "Tiananmen Mother" to coordinate and distribute the humanitarian aid.
In 1998, the MCDF set up the "六四 orphan education fund", and after 11 years, in 2009, all the orphaned children of the Tiananmen were graduated from university. The MCDF then set up the " <v>六四 old people in need of special assistance fund</v>," and has been implemented until today.
The funds for these projects come mainly from campus and social donations in the六四 years, from individual donations, and are supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Prison Reform Foundation.
It was 31 years ago, on June 4, that the六四 students finally received a donation from Hong Kong in the name of the June 4.
During this period, China Human Rights was also independently implementing its humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding called for a halt in donations to the六四 Memorial because it was for the benefit of donors. We are all retired people, and our income is not as plentiful as it was before we retire. We thank Mr. Ding for his letter to a friend.
We will respect the decision of the members and terminate this project within two years and resume when necessary.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those colleagues who have been generous in giving and risking to deliver humanitarian aid for many years.

Photo effect: I took two sets of clothes. In general, they are not bad. I like this picture a lot.
[Service] Service Details: Because I was a little uncomfortable when I was making up, the makeup artist and the staff were very kind to me. Let me rest for a while and always give me hot water to drink.
Package price: 1000 yuan
Thank you for the review from the rabbit. I had said that it was not suitable for the traditional style. I had no idea that the final product was so beautiful.
Thank you, Dan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction will make us charge up and keep moving forward. We will keep pushing forward!
This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend all my friends to come!
Whether it is in terms of reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography and post-production, it is flawless.
The makeup artist is very meticulous. He will match your style and make a suitable makeup for you. The cosmetics used are all high-end brands.
Mr. Tian Liang, for example, is a professional photographer.
The whole studio is full of artistic atmosphere, and there are two little cats to play with.
We are working in Beijing. Beijing studios need to wait for six months in advance to take photos. Our colleagues have taken photos in Beijing. I think the result is just so-so.
I have been looking for this studio for a long time, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expressions are not good, so we think this is also the short version of most people. The photographer Liang哥 will catch the moment of natural beauty and record it.
The makeup artist, the photographer, the post-production designer, a fine team.
We and everyone around us were speechless with praise.
I have recommended my friend to go, and my friend just saw the finished film and was equally happy.
I hope that such a studio will not be hidden, and that more people will find it and make it their own style, not just clichés.
I would like to express my gratitude to the five-star comments from both Guoyang and Jingling. Both of them are very creative new people with great ideas. We are an idea studio. As long as the customers like, we will do our best to complete it. Thank you for meeting each other.
The sweet assistant and the lively photographer teacher made every member of the team super-nice. It was a wonderful experience. It was an unforgettable experience. And the result of the shooting was much better than I imagined. Thank you so much.
Thank you for your commentary. Meeting you is also a缘分. From Hohhot to Qingdao. Our trust in you is just as long as the thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to meet you. I will come to Qingdao again and again.

An aspiring programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you want to enter the industry, it is better to choose a place to do training. But if you don't have such ideas, it is better to learn by yourself, because training costs are very high, and it takes 6 months to learn.
However, if you are planning to enter the industry, training is a very good choice. In particular, those who have a weak self-discipline and training are a very good choice.
If you have a strong self-discipline, you can also choose to learn by yourself. However, it will be a little tired.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we should see the strength of the teachers in the institution. If the teachers in the institution are not strong, the training institution will not have any meaning. Of course, some new training institutions have not been very strong.
Secondly, before choosing, you should inquire about the training institution. It is better to inquire about the students of the institution, because only the students of the institution know how the institution works. The courses are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question. Because for your own situation, there is no certain introduction. And the learning of this thing and the personal situation are very related.
For example, the specialty, the age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you want to work in, will all be related to the industry you want to learn or work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated or if you are a computer major who graduated, I would recommend that you study by yourself. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Now many online and offline training institutions are actually very good. But the cost of learning is high, and the time invested is more. You basically need to concentrate on training for 3 to 6 months.
However, if these situations are what I said, self-taught is very convenient. Now many learning resources on the Internet are free or have many training resources. If you can't find the resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources or detailed consultations.
There are also some other classic books that can be combined with the video to learn.
If you are not a computer science major, but you can afford to pay a certain amount of learning costs and time costs, you should go to a training institution to study. This will not be very difficult, the teacher will explain it in detail, there will be people who will answer your questions, and there will also be help in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internship places, and recommend them to companies. This will also save a lot of work for them to find work in the future.
These are some of my views. The above is only an introduction to your situation. If you have any other questions, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said come 1 o'clock, I saw it in the app
What is it called
I haven't finished yet, what are you doing?
Me, I will take on all kinds of (installation, cleaning, repair), radiator heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, oil burners, lighting fittings, glass cleaning, professional caulk, home care services

Life will not辜负 every effort made by those who love me, so please don't forget to follow me and give me a thumbs up.
Life is like this. People only see the result. You are alone to support the process. In the face of life, we can only be strong. We can not continue. We can look back, but we cannot walk back...
Maintenance is work, but also a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of care.
Although we do the most dirty work, we will do it with the most serious attitude. We will clean every corner of the customer's house to the best of our ability. When we see the customer's satisfied smile and big thumb, all the fatigue is worth it. When you give something, you will get something back.
My daily work
Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, and retain the beautiful.
Everything you care about, such as the cleanliness of the house, can be achieved by our home care service.
To maintain the cleanliness of the family, to establish a family care record, to provide adequate services, and to clean the home to perfection.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
The crystal chandelier is beautiful, but it will be dull after a long time if it is not cleaned. Only after it is cleaned can it shine. So is life.
It takes effort to succeed, and it takes care to create exquisite beauty. We are serious about it.
Give me a chance, I will make you satisfied, quality is everything, because professionalism is worthy of trust, your recognition is my encouragement!
The current industry is hard to do!
But I always believe that with careful attitude, enough perseverance and enough efforts, I will be better than others at least, and I will be better than sitting and complaining!"
The key to a successful day lies in the morning. All the good things begin in the morning. I wish you a happy, lucky, healthy and prosperous start to a new day. Good morning!
When I was little, happiness was something that you had when you had it; when you had it, you were happy. When you grew up, happiness was something to aim for, and when you got it, you were happy. When you got older, you found that happiness was a mindset, and you were happy when you understood it.
Do the most real and kindest self, act according to the heart, have no regrets in this life; there is only one road in life, walk your own road; there are two treasures in life: good body and good mood, live a beautiful life to the end!
Every stage of life will encounter different difficulties.
In many cases, what binds you is not ability, but the courage to face positively.
Since we can't avoid it, let's face it.
The more you are afraid, the more you will be knocked down by the difficulties; if you rise to the difficulties, the problems will be solved.
China and Saudi Arabia jointly host the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (reporter Wang Haoyi and Hu Gang) - Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial, the Driyer Contemporary Art Biennial, was officially opened to the public on the 11th day of the month in the Driyer Art District in the north of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated in the exhibition.
This biennial is jointly planned by the Saudi Driyay Biennial Foundation and the Chinese UCCA Urlas Contemporary Art Center. Chen Yiyu, director of the Chinese UCCA Urlas Contemporary Art Center, served as the artistic director.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of this biennial is "crossing the river by touching the stones", which is an allusion to the reform strategy adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and reflects the current condition of Saudi social and cultural development.
This biennial art exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and is displayed in six interconnected buildings. The exhibition is presented in the form of six units: "Touching the Rocks and Crossing the River", "Transmission as an Experiment", "边缘思考", "Writing to the Public", "The Beautiful New World" and "The Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total collection, covering painting, installation art and performance art; the works of 12 Chinese artists are also very popular, and some artists use recycled materials in a novel way to create art, such as Xu Bing in "The Back Story Series:溪山无尽图" (2014).
Barki, the chief executive of the Dubai Biennial Foundation, said that he hopes that this biennial can establish international dialogue and let the global audience know about the thriving culture industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, so as to strengthen interaction and exchange.
Tian Yiyu said, "The goal of the biennial is double. It not only allows Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, but also allows Saudi audiences to integrate themselves into the world of contemporary art. "
It is understood that a series of seminars will also be held during the opening week of the festival. Artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss issues such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare jobs - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency Kunming, December 12 (reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job of employment assistance for poverty-stricken people and consolidate and expand the results of poverty relief, Yunnan Province has recently issued relevant policies to promote the management of public welfare jobs in rural areas, helping to comprehensively promote the revitalization of rural areas.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Human Resources Department of Yunnan Province, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 44,83,000 public welfare posts in rural areas, which are used for the employment of rural vulnerable groups such as laborers in poverty, to help them achieve employment and income increase, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of various public services in rural areas.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan People’s Social Security, Rural Revitalization, Finance and other seven departments. The main purpose of the new regulations is to unify and standardize the scope of applicants for rural public service posts, the management of funds, the development of posts, and the management of posts.
In the setting of job development, the new rules are clear. According to the principles of "job setting according to need, person assignment according to job, dynamic management, total control", "who develops the job and who uses the job and who is responsible for the job" and "one person, one job, voluntary public and unified management".
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, appointment, pre-employment training and arrangement for employment.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare jobs, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare jobs, and the requirements for the development departments of rural public welfare jobs to buy accident damage commercial insurance for the安置 personnel of rural public welfare jobs. It also requires the relevant departments to supervise the subsidy of rural public welfare jobs regularly.
Address is wrong
Hello
Can you cancel the order?
I ordered again
Is it cancelled?
Second, although the right wing has achieved success in the past, it is not long, so the shortcoming is that it is bright because it gets a little sunshine and sweat because it drinks a little water; when it is a little satisfied, it is easy to be arrogant, and when it is hit, it is easy to be attached.
But in fact, the right-wing played a positive role in social progress.
From the end of the definition of truth and standards, the development of economy and technology, and the promotion of political institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right wing should not be denied.
III. To me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Wei Dong's opinions, I care about his opinions, and I respect Li Wei Dong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and about social problems in China.
But I do not agree with his anti-communist theory. I believe that the anti-revolution is inevitable, and the revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil,民生 damage, and political groups are mixed with mud and sand. In addition, foreign countries will take advantage of this opportunity.
Fourth, change or improve China must have patience and the attitude of responsible for the country and the people. The attempt of political speculation is like taking a栗 in the fire. That is not the right wing, but the bastard.
Let's talk about left.
Left, in fact, is a bunch of time and politics.
If the right had any positive meaning for society, the Communist Party would listen to some right-wing speeches and analyze their thoughts when it was needed. On the left, there is no such opportunity, for the left wants exactly what the Communist Party is throwing away!
Five. I recently saw some friends arguing with the enemy while refuting the left. It was quite moving. I thought it was unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitor and the leftist, they are on the same page and there is no way to argue.
We should not try to prove that we are right, nor should we think of letting the enemy and the left admit it. Why?
I told my friends like this: when the fools and the leftists insult you, it just proves that our middle road is the right way!
Many young people also had ideals when they were young, but when they were old, they forgot their ideals, or pursued their ideals but became obsessed.
And the ideal is getting further and further away, and even the dragon boy becomes a bad dragon.
To the left and to the right, I think generally refers to constraints and freedoms. China should be more to the left from the inherent genes of history and culture.
While the right-wing liberals prioritize efficiency and development, the leftists strengthen regulation and focus more on fairness and security.
Nowadays, the society generally hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, China and the United States are at war, and the left is certain. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, I will like it.
Nothing to say, flowers are so kind
In the past two years, the blockade and blockade of the United States on Huawei chips has not only made Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US-style" enterprises.
The United States has been repressing the chip industry in China and has asked its own enterprises and allied countries to block the chip industry in China at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, causing the shortage of the chip supply chain worldwide.
Today, "芯荒" has affected every industry in the world, such as the shutdown of car manufacturers and the rise of mobile phone prices. Almost all industries that use chips have been greatly affected.
In order to grasp the autonomy of "芯", more and more science and technology giants in many countries are starting the road of "going away from the United States."
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor industry and restrain the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry, the United States has been making frequent moves recently. At the same time, it is also the host of the "芯片 summit". It is also inviting 64 countries to join forces to form a semiconductor alliance and invest money to support American domestic technology giants. For example, the United States' leading technology giant Intel has invested 2 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, to reclaim the dominant position in the chip industry.
When most people think that Intel's move will cause a certain impact on TSMC and is likely to take away TSMC's "dinner".
The reason for this confidence is that Intel, as a well-known US technology giant, has been working on the semiconductor industry for decades and has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves. It is certain to rise quickly and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, for the decision of Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company founder Zhang Zhongming is indifferent.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongming surprised everyone by saying that Intel had spent a lot of money to build a wafer factory. Zhang Zhongming was quite frank and said that Intel built a chip factory to make chips, which was quite ironic.
It is because of the dispute between Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel more than 30 years ago that Zhang Zhongming is so unimpressed with Intel's entry into the semiconductor industry.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of the US manufacturing industry and stood at the top of the world. It was the leader in the semiconductor industry.
In the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were always controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. The chip was designed, manufactured and tested by a factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a pattern makes some small enterprises difficult to bear, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are forced to walk away from the huge construction costs of production lines.
Inspired by the market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show the phenomenon of specialization and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongming heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he believed that since there was a company specializing in design, it was possible to set up a special plant for the manufacture of wafers.
Shortly afterwards, Zhang Zhongming's idea turned into reality, and TSMC was born.
台积电 focused on "wafer processing", which is a single link, and did not design, but only provided wafer manufacturing for subcontracting service.
At that time, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which was just established, was nothing more than a small slave before Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongming once sought Intel Investment, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did manufacturing in the chip industry, it was obviously arrogant and looked down on TSMC. It was determined to reject investment in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongming also believed that Intel was despising the wafer process service at that time.
I didn't expect that the giant in contempt of the wafer manufacturing service would now have to start doing wafer manufacturing.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongming thinks that Intel's entry into the semiconductor manufacturing is very ironic.
Today, the market value of TSMC has exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of the strong attack of TSMC, Intel is also afraid of being self-contained.
Today, TSMC is racing towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 7 years ago's 14nm.
It is not easy to catch up.
Not waiting
The order was placed at 19:06.
Today, let's take a look at some strange hot search.
What is normal public opinion?
Chosen at random, three hot topics in February 2: the rising of the dragon on February 2, the rise of the price of goods, and the incident of the event of the rise of the event of the rise of the price of goods, the spread of public opinion formed a wave peak, and then the index decreased (smooth curve) finally disappeared, and if there was secondary public opinion, there would be a small peak again.
They look exactly the same as the "演化 model of online public opinion" displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration.
What is abnormal public opinion?
The six most popular topics in the same event are selected at random and presented as "rocky peaks", "stepped cliffs" and "rocky cliffs".
The "monument-like" is the artificial heating, which quickly climbs the hot search list and attracts the public's attention; the "sawtooth-like" is the cyclical heating, which ensures that the topic remains on the hot search list. The "valley-like" is the collective withdrawal, and when the hot search function is used up, it receives a new task and rushes to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the height of the event's heat wave coincides with the bottom of the other event's heat wave, and there is no more than a few seconds, which is certain to be a unified fleet of water forces received the task and opened a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black PR can be seen in the fact that dozens of hot search are on the list at the same time, which attract the attention of the public, which are responsible for popularization of knowledge, which instigate conflicts, which divert the attention of the public, which affect cognition, which mislead judgments, which incite emotions, which influence decisions, which are divided into batches and nodes to carry out detailed operations, almost taking into account all the elements of the dissemination of public opinion.
Communication is a science. In the absence of all subjective factors such as position and emotion, the only objective data, black PR will be nowhere to be found.
Every step will leave a trace, and such traces, we will dig up together.

Mauritius and other countries have found the first case of Omegle poisoning infection - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 -- According to a report by Xinhua News Agency overseas correspondents: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first case of infection with the Covid-19 variant virus Omicron.
On the 10th day of the month, Mauritius reported two cases of OMMICRON poisoning in the country for the first time.
According to Minister of Health Mehra Kailash Jaggutpal, one infected person was a tourist who left from South Africa on November 27 and arrived in Mauritius; the other infected person was a local resident of Mauritius who had contact with a person who had visited South Africa and then returned on November 30.
After being treated in isolation at the hospital, the two infected people had their nucleic acid tests turned negative. They have now returned to their homes.
On the 10th day of the month, the Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced that the country had confirmed the first three cases of OMMEC ringworm infection.
These three people are students. They came back from traveling abroad at the beginning of this month. Since they are all mild cases, they did not enter the hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the OMMIKERMOG strain, the government has been increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers aged 12 and above who enter the country by plane will have to pay for the nucleic acid test at the airport after arriving in Saudi Arabia.
On the 10th day of the month, the Ministry of Health announced that it will start to vaccinate children aged 5 to 11 in the country with the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine.
On the 9th, Malawi's Minister of Health, Kembozi Chimonde, said that the country had first found three cases of Omeglexon toxin infection.
The country's health department sequenced the genomes of 12 positive samples for COVID-19 collected from November 9 to December 2, and found the three cases of infection.

Big beauty 360 integrated home decoration
Address: 156环城南路幸福家园12楼
It was recommended to me by a friend because of my trust. So I decided to check it out. At the beginning, my budget was RMB 70,000 for a basic renovation.
He came to the store and started a series of tricks.
I came to the store for the first time just to show them my floor plan and they didn't even take the time to measure the house. They were able to give me a price for my 135sqm house of about R7 million, which is ridiculous. They didn't even tell me about the brand of the materials.
Their second trick is that once you enter the store, you will drag yourself to pay the deposit (which you will never get back unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that you can get as much discount as you paid the deposit today.
This is a big hole. I am an example of being fooled. When my head is in a rush, I paid more than 10,000 yuan in advance.
He gave me a lot of questions about the price without including the renovation of water and electricity, without including any doors and cupboards in the bathroom, and these three are the main costs of the basic installation.
In addition, their service fee is also higher than that of other companies.
I lost confidence in the company and at the beginning did not clarify anything and asked me to sign the contract.
When I went to ask for their money back, they showed their experience. There was a special team to deal with you.
In any case, they will bite the bullet and say that it is the customer's fault. They are completely innocent.
There are various excuses, and there are too many details to say, I don't want to say it one by one, it is tears, in general, you should not choose them, because my friend also hired them to renovate the house, and the quality is not good.
坑爹， they are the龙头装饰 that used to deceive people, and now they have changed their name to big beauty, and they seem to have closed down again and changed their name to other names.
Therefore, don't choose such a shameless construction company.
In the future, when you choose, you can do a little more research on these. Because the renovation is not small money.
To ask a question to the merchant, please log in or register first
It is strictly forbidden to release any form of business comments, and the detailed statement is as follows:
You can find the latest business information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of the 360-degree integrated home furnishing company on the Meituan Qingdao home furnishing design channel. Find a home furnishing company by visiting Meituan.com.
So creepy, cancel the order within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Okay, so don't cancel this conversation. If I don't get my money back in 5 to 10 days, I will definitely investigate.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes
口水鸡 should be cooked, but the meat received was raw, so I couldn't eat it
Starry Night: The Sagittarius流星雨 will reach its maximum on the 14th - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (reporter Zhou Runqiang) -- As the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will welcome its maximum on December 14. Friends who love meteor showers can observe it in the midnight after the event.
The Pleiades流星雨, photographed by Anju, an amateur astronomer in Beijing, on December 13, 2018.
Most meteor showers have their parent bodies of comets, but the parent bodies of the Gemini meteor shower are 3,200 asteroids called Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Sagittarius流星雨 is also the second known non-cometary meteor shower.
Xie Liupeng, a member of the Astronomical Society of Tianjin and an expert in astronomy and popularization of science, said that, just like holiday movies, the Sagittarius流星雨 usually appears at the end of the year. "The screening period" can be from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is known for its large and steady flow, and is together with the Perseid meteor shower and the Leonid meteor shower called the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
One of the significant characteristics of the Sagittarius流星雨 is that the speed of the meteorite is slow, the color is rich, and the fire meteorites are not few. It is suitable for the shooting of beginners both in sight and in astronomy photography.
The shooting of the Gemini流星雨 by Tianjin astronomer Yang Jing on December 13, 2020.
According to the astronomical prediction, the Sagittarius流星雨 will arrive at its maximum on December 14 at about 15:00. At its maximum, the ZHR (the number of流星 visible per hour when the radiation point is in the top right of the head, in ideal observation conditions), is 150.
The recommended index map of the Sagittarius流星雨.
Last year, the Pleiades流星雨, which was known for its beauty, left a deep impression on people. However, this year's Pleiades will be affected by the moonlight, and the beauty will be slightly reduced.
On the 14th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, the moon will be full and bright. The bright moonlight will cause interference to the observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the last part of the night. At this time, the radiation point of the Sagittarius流星雨 will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the hours after the moon sets in the night. But be careful to keep warm and to avoid getting cold. "
How can we observe more流星?
It is not recommended to observe in a city. You can choose a place with a high altitude, a small light pollution, and a wide field of vision facing the east. Then you can wait patiently until the moon falls to observe.
It is worth noting that the flow of the Gemini meteor shower is very large in all directions. It is not necessary to keep staring at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower while observing.
If you have friends who love photography, you should choose a wide angle and a large aperture lens to take a magnificent "流星雨" picture. When shooting, you should use a high ISO and the maximum aperture.
In view of stability and continuity, tripod, spare batteries and shutter cord are also indispensable. "
He reminded.
What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the topic is the LCD TV, and the difference between the laser TV and the LCD TV in the market positioning is mainly two points.
First, the laser television is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the comprehensive positioning of the market for LCD televisions, laser televisions are obviously focused on the big screen market, or laser televisions are born as a product for big screens.
At present, mainstream LCD televisions are generally 55 inches to 65 inches in size, while laser televisions are generally 75 inches or more in size, and the largest exceeds 100 inches, which fully meets the user's demand for large-screen LCD televisions.
In recent years, the proportion of laser television in the total sales of televisions in the world has been increasing, and it accounts for more than 60% of the total sales of televisions over 80 inches.
According to the prediction of China Everbright, the sales of laser TV in 2020 will increase by more than 140%, and will continue to maintain high growth.
The reason for such a good performance in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser television in the field of eye protection.
On the basis of the imaging principle of laser television, the light emitted by the laser light source does not enter the eye directly. Compared with the backlight of the liquid television, the imaging process is closer to the natural condition of the object. The stimulation on the eye is also smaller.
Through strict comparison tests between laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions in a population, researchers from the China Electronics Technology Standardization Institute (CETSI) and ophthalmologists from Beijing协和医院 obtained 144 sets of test data.
The data confirmed that laser televisions have a very strong protective function for the eyes. In some aspects, they even have a certain improvement effect.
At a time when eye health is becoming more and more important, laser televisions not only attract more and more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also open up another breakthrough in the television market.
Second, laser televisions are more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuous descent of the price of LCD televisions, the price of laser televisions on the market is mostly more than 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price is gradually climbing.
Why is the price of laser TV so high?
It is certainly true.
Under the continuous development of light sources and technical levels, laser televisions have many advantages that cannot be realized by LCD televisions and projection.
With its short throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment. It can realize the experience of 100-inch screen at a short distance. It requires little space and the主机 is small. It occupies little space.
In terms of brightness, the large brand laser TV can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, it has lower heat release and smaller equipment loss, so the life of the television is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, and bio-inspired screen, which can bring users a more shocking visual and sound experience.
It is not pseudo-demand, but the result of demand subdivision. In terms of picture quality and input output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of影音 players. If you want to balance the large screen and the viewing environment, you can try it. There are both advantages and disadvantages to everything. You can judge after weighing it in. I fear that you will believe in one side's words.
To get close to the screen, the ultra-wide-angle and near-focus projector-laser television has to use the expensive ultra-wide-angle lens and reflector, which is not in line with the optical best design.
In order to block part of the environmental light, use a micro-structure Fenzel screen, which is expensive, and the price of 80 inches is basically able to exchange for a 65-inch LCD.
There is one thing I especially hate from the projection manufacturers who put forward the argument that the reflection of the screen is good for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is the direct light for the eyes. You can reflect the light on the ceiling and the eyes can't see it. So, the LCD TV is also the direct light. Is it not true to light up the ceiling when you open the TV?
Moreover, if the screen is not a diffused reflection, it cannot be a projection screen.
It is precisely those high-gain screen's hot spot (spot) effect that are ignored. A lot of light is reflected to the eyes from a certain angle. That is the real pain.
Visual Art Photography Museum selects the best quality store. There is no branch yet
With the addition of the WeChat appointment date, the little sister sent me the time options I could choose and the reply was timely.
Before going, I saw the shooting works in the store, more outdoor weddings, and they were very beautiful. There were many styles involved in the shooting.
After arriving on the day, I had a brief conversation with the little sister. She was very patient and helped me try two sets of clothes I was stuck in. Finally, I decided to start makeup and styling. The photographer will put some props before the shoot. He will guide the action and be more meticulous about the details.
But it may be because I didn't communicate the specific shooting ideas with you, so the style wasn't what I wanted, but it was good-looking <v>.</v>
After the photo is taken, the photographer will help choose the photos, exchange the later style, and it feels very careful.
It takes about half a month to repair the film. Wait and see the effect.
The second time I got a photo-themed霸王餐. Most of the clothes in the room can be chosen to be photographed.
Finally, she chose a black silk gown to try different styles.
The whole shooting process took about two hours, plus makeup and shooting. The photographer responsible for the shooting was his younger brother, who was 95 years old. He was a bit immature, so I hope that in the future I can give more suggestions for customers to take pictures. He was quite talkative, and the shooting process was quite pleasant.
Visual Art Photography Museum selects the best quality store  reply
I got on the front page, so I thought I'd check out Queenie.
Before coming to the store, I filled in my name and phone number and then chose the clothing. The bridal gowns can be chosen. I changed three or four sets of clothing and was very patient. After choosing, I spent a long time on makeup. The service attitude was also good. In the later shooting, I will teach you how to arrange the style. The face is so big when you take the photo. After editing, it will be sent in about half a month or three or four days. The feeling is not much different from the original film.
The environment is overall good.
There are many optional clothes.
There are about three makeup positions in the room.
The service was very warm and very careful.
The hairstylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the action very seriously.
If the photographer is not satisfied, he will also propose to take a new photo.
The <v>experience</v> may have been a little too much. The original eyeliner was cut into three eyeliner.
The eyebrows were also shaved, which was a little awkward for someone who didn't usually draw eyebrows.
The photo was sent to me ten days ago, but I was not satisfied with the P图 effect. I felt that the double eyelashes were still quite obvious.
Because it is not clear what style to choose, I tried two sets and finally chose the black gown. The little girl said that this set is more in the style of Hepburn.
After choosing the clothes, I started to make up. The hairstylist and makeup artist were very patient and helped me make up. The result was very satisfactory.
After getting my makeup and hair done, we started taking pictures. The photographer kept instructing me to pose. The whole process was very easy and harmonious.
After shooting, he carefully selected four of his favorite and edited them. The result was a very satisfied end.
I have not received a reply in three days... Since your system cannot identify my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay
I have to pay for every delivery now
Can I be exempted from paying the monthly fee until you have completed your investigation?
Is it safe to buy a small umbrella insurance?
The small umbrella is an Internet insurance broker platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Agents (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance agent, it is necessary to meet three keywords, namely, there must be no major violations in the past three years, the minimum limit is RMB 5 million, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In fact, these three rules are very strict. Summarizing, it is necessary to have strength, be approved by the State Authorities of the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervise the insurance companies and banks within the country), and the shareholders should have a good style. As the insurance intermediary company, the small umbrella insurance, the insurer does not need to question the legitimacy of the small umbrella insurance, because there are three thresholds. Not all insurance companies can achieve.
On this point, it is not bad, it is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: the small umbrella insurance is a kind of insurance supermarket, and many celebrity super-disease insurance products are sold on this platform. For example, the super-disease insurance recently put on the platform, and the insurer and the insured are both Huaxia Life. The small umbrella insurance is only a third-party mediator, so it is not necessary to question its reliability.
From the point of view of payment mode: The products of Internet platforms are generally more cost-effective because they do not include the operating expenses of business points and the wages of salesmen. In addition, Internet products can be paid monthly, which can reduce the payment pressure of the insurer, and at the same time, the leverage of insurance can be maximized.
This is still very good.
Consider it.
From the professionalism of the salesperson: this is particularly important, because insurance is a very demanding industry in terms of professionalism. Many Internet products can be insured by the customer himself. This will lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health notification and occupation, non-insurance personnel will often add their subjective consciousness when they insure. They think they are healthy or fit. This will easily lead to many insurance risks. There is a risk of denial of insurance.
I have also worked as an insurance salesman for Tencent Weixing (Tencent Weixing is a kind of Internet insurance intermediary platform), which is very responsible.
The insurance on the Internet is real, and it is also reliable. Unreliable is the person. There are no professional personnel in the Internet channels, and there are also many sales misconceptions.
For example, 1 yuan insurance is worth 600,000, and you can buy insurance and get a mobile phone for free. You can get a 6 million insurance amount for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they choose to ignore the importance of the disease and focus on the mobile phone. They will not tell the insurer that the first month is 1 yuan, and the next month is normal charging. The amount is different, from less than 50 yuan to more than 200 yuan. Many customers have paid for two or three years, and they do not know what the mobile phone is.
He thought that he could spend 1 yuan and the insurance company would pay 60 million.
Free mobile phones are only sent to the last few digits of the policy number, such as 66666 or 88888, in special policy numbers such as 66666 or 88888. If the winning text message is sent, you do not have to exchange the mobile phone and no one reminds you.
(This is another pit for the insurer) It is short term to get 6 million insurance amount for free. If you only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance. If you have a serious disease, 6 million is not enough. In the future, you will start to run naked.
Currently, the misleading sales of Internet insurance are also being severely punished by the state.
Therefore, in general, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, and the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the businessmen.
It is suggested that the subject considers comprehensively and carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokers have more products and customers can choose more opportunities and products. Some products are more economical than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers, insured offline products, and saved each person 2000-3000 yuan/year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
I am a business insurance broker with 3 years of experience in enterprise management training and more than 1,000 enterprises. I have worked with more than 100 insurance companies. Before signing a contract, I will take the needs of customers into account to customize a insurance product for them. In the process of signing a contract, I will do a comparison shopping for them and try my best to get the best insurance result for them. After signing a contract, I will do the insurance document organization, insurance document custody, so that customers can feel at ease.
To grow together with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the OP!
According to the definition of the insurance supervision department, Internet insurance is insurance business that can be completed by clicking on the link of insurance and completing all the投保 procedures.
In the process, the insurer does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the insurer independently.
Although the Internet insurance has no "ceremony" in the coverage, even if there is no printed paper contract, it has no effect on the validity and legality of the electronic contract.
This kind of model is a little similar to the production line of "telephone sales", but so to buy insurance will also have a fatal problem, that is, the follow-up services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for several decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether we choose a "mediator" that can stay with us for many years and provide us with services after many years?

From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slanders and insults, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate such villains.
If you don't look at parties and factions, the first to be opposed is this uncivilized behavior.
Since you started to send friend requests on Facebook, and then posted humorous posts, and finally tried to post the so-called home location and the name of my father on social media, I have taken the attitude of not responding.
You went to great lengths not only to tag me every day at the same frequency as the six meals, but also to continue discussing with your so-called friends on Facebook about some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, such as comments on my face, body, good breeding, and so on. I... I also got over it.
I didn't know that later, I received a number of friends to send me about your Facebook friends' account uploaded a photo of you and offensive remarks.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can't continue to be silent.
After I uploaded the news of my calling the police, you didn't show any restraint and became even more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is or what your status is, in our society, there is a need for respect between men and women.
Yes, you can continue this kind of joking, indirect, humiliating, and insulting remarks, you can continue to say that you just care and concern me, you can continue to think that it is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not you made the picture or continue to publish all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't, nor can I stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and body shape don't need you to judge.
I don't even think there would be any girl who would be willing to be humiliated by others in order to get famous.
My friend asked me, "How are you?"
I said, you wouldn't believe me either.
I don't think there is any girl who can say that she is okay after being bullied.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic morals will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice will prevail.
I cut some comments for you to judge
It should be impossible for no one to impersonate you.
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization
Smiling heartily
Vietnam News - Prime Minister Nguyen Minh Triet attends the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum

High-speed rail居然之家
Address: 555 North Road,高铁北一路
Here, there are a variety of home appliances and brands, and well-known brands are all.
On the 12th day of the 12th month, I went to the "Hanson" water purifier store to see the water purifier. The store was holding an activity and the price was relatively favorable.
The居然之家 has 11 floors, from the second floor to the ninth floor. The basement and the first and second floors are all parking places. And parking is free during the day!
The surrounding is not very good, and there are few hardware stores in the restaurant. The restaurant has an average taste.
This elevator is also very frustrating, just like when you have a big illness, with a negative two to one. You have to move around and stop at the same level as I do. From the safety channel to the first floor, it is also very frustrating. You can only go to a furniture store if the store is closed.
居然之家 still needs to be improved, many places have not been developed.
Address: 555 North Road,高铁北一路, Shaibei District, convenient transportation, big parking lot, free day and night.
Environment: To be honest, there are 8-9 floors in the store. I can find all kinds of furniture, household appliances, and small things I want to buy in the store. Many famous brands have settled in the store. I only remember so much. It is a good place to buy products. If you are tired of shopping, you can sit on the sofa to rest.
Recently, I want to buy a comfortable sofa. My friend said that there are so many sofas to choose here. I saw HomeGoods and Meijiajia, and I think they are okay, but the price is a little high, so I am still in a dilemma.
You can find the latest business information such as the address, phone number and opening hours of高铁居然之家 on this page. If you are looking for a装修公司, please don't hesitate to come here.

U.S. Three warships gather around China’s periphery, and the most powerful weapon in the United States rarely visits the islands of Rarotonga in 2022-01-17, Vang Vang News, a pro-Communist media from Vietnam: The latest satellite images show that three warships of the United States are gathering around China’s periphery. The US media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US navy’s arsenal rarely visits the islands of Rarotonga in the East China Sea, which sends an important signal to its allies and enemies in the region.
According to the news from the "North China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" of China's think tank, on January 9, the satellite found the US warship "USS Carl Vinson" in the vicinity of the Balabac Strait.
The Strait of Malacca connects the South China Sea and the Sea of Sulu, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the West Pacific.
The platform predicts that the "Cal Vinson" will deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the "Falcon" aircraft carrier carried the F-35C fighter and the CMV-22 "Phantom" aircraft carrier to deploy.
The US航母, which is currently engaged in the operation in the Pacific, in addition to the “Carl Vinson”, also includes the “Abraham Lincoln”, which departed from the United States on January 3.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C aircraft中队 for the first time, which belongs to the 314 Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the Ronald Reagan (USS Ronald Reagan) aircraft carrier, which is based in Sasebo, Japan.
The combat group also includes the "Majestic Lake" missile cruiser and the "Starkader" missile驱逐舰.

When talking to his friends about the recent decline of Meta by 26% and the蒸发 of US $2.510 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that he was "facing unprecedented competition." What was the reason for this?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is in fact a advertising company. Its revenue mainly comes from advertising. Today's advertising companies that make money, the company has its own channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and so on, regardless of the kind of function positioning, are meta-traffic channels.
In addition, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", and many external apps can advertise on Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta can no longer get the user's data and information, affecting the efficiency of ad placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users, and it will be obvious to tell users whether to allow the app to obtain their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow.
If Google hits another blow, the impact on Meta's income will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese component of the previous Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion is not certain, but it does exist).
People usually know Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual income comes from China, mainly from companies that do business in China.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about a hundred people, and there are several major agents in mainland China.
To expand overseas markets, companies in China need Meta more than ever. The money they spend on Meta is mostly given to Meta.
Interesting is that now Byte's TT is Meta's main competitor, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte in the last two years.
All domestic agents are helping Byte to place ads there, and the performance of Meta in China is also very good.
I haven't been specifically looking into that recently, but I don't think it will get any better.
The phase of Chinese companies spending heavily overseas has passed.
Thirdly, the new flow channels are not successful.
Facebook is getting older and older, and new platforms, including TT, are no longer in the Meta's hand.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only interested in income, but also in the expectation of the future.
It is obvious that Meta's expectation is not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "original universe".
The Yuan Cosmos is indeed one of the future directions. However, the realization period of the Yuan Cosmos is relatively long. This story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the past two or three years.
Therefore, in the next two years, Meta should be a difficult period.
Although Facebook is now very prosperous, it earns as much as 1 trillion to 2 billion US dollars every year. In reality, Facebook is very worried about the crisis. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, it has no good or safe moat.
Although his social software has a relatively high daily active users and is also a mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the rapid development of TikTok.
And the concept of a pseudo-universe, which is achievable but unattainable in a short time, has no hope of success, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is the reason why Zuckerberg is changing the company's name again and again and is constantly looking for new routes. But I think his route selection is wrong, it is a dead end road. These are some of my thoughts.
