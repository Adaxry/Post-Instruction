The goods cost under 20 euros.
The fee is 40% of the value of the goods...
I am #PRS_ORG# and so it is not a problem for me.
Just a number or a reference so that I can track it back to you.
I have ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249 euros.
Today it costs 179 euros.
I find that very difficult.
Do I have to cancel the order and make a new one for the better price or is there another option for signature?
I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parenting role for their little siblings.
However, I find that it is good to take care of the children in a friendly way.
Quick look, quick help, bring the bottle etc.
So you learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as you can still be a child, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is only used for the short term and it is OK for you, that is good.
You can determine for yourself whether this is right for your children.
It is not so that he should go to K2 and spend hours sleeping.
It is probably unfair.
Maybe the psychologist will also say that.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, a collapse, an earthquake, an alien invasion etc., it would really be too much responsibility for K1 to deal with K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is your decision;)
Help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember the whole operation, but the title does not make me want to fall asleep...
The story dealt with fear and this was to be treated.
At the beginning of the story, a pet rabbit commits suicide by swallowing his own tail and climbing into a tree.
The case will be taken over by a commissioner, who will investigate his therapists at a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The commissioner has a small child who also has a fear (of fire), and this therapist lands.
There is more self-mortality and there is another protagonist - a photographer who will be asked to go to the site of the massacre and document it and put photos on the internet.
Otherwise, this therapist ultimately prescribes a kind of background therapy where the patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses the patient's fear center in the brain and the patients eventually have to put themselves in extreme situations.
(Another woman jumps out of the window with a deadly intention)
This will be described in the book as "the fight".
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic where a fire had to be done.
This is the broad treatment I am sure that the book was translated from the original by a French author / author.
If this action is known to someone or even to me, I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
First contact my man.
This can take time.
What steps should I then take?
Is it also possible to reverse the price difference?
Kind, 4 j., Splitter under the Daumennagel
Kind, four years old, has crossed the entire length of the Holzsplitter under the dawn.
They tried to catch him with a pin.
Very difficult to climb.
Not caught and killed.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
There is no chance.
Tomorrow is the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a master plate, we can achieve a reduction of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any location of the spur.
LokSound 5 decoders will be offered with all the common formats and will always come with a 11x15mm thick “Zuckerwurf” loudspeaker.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is an actual multiprotocol decoder.
He dominates the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are as obvious as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoder is automatically connected to a planned digital centre.
He dominates all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom® can be read the CV values at the main rail.
For central computers, which can only program the CVs from 1 to 255, there is a help register.
Motorola's competitors benefit from up to 28 trips at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola addresses enable the release of 16 functions.
An embedded program mode also makes it possible to program the incriminating Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol automatically reports to mfx® compatible central servers.
The LokSound 5 Decoder recognizes the Märklin® Bremsstrecken as well as ZIMO® HLU Bremsbefehle or the Lenz® ABC System.
Also the brake with DCC brakes or with equalization is possible.
In addition, he also holds a Selectrix® Bremsdiode.
An ABC-pendulum allows the automatic pendulum between two towers.
The LokSound 5 Decoder can be used with analog equalizer and changeover frequencies.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to prevent discrimination
Politics and science in Britain are constantly worried about new micro-crime cases.
Therefore, all qualified adults in England should receive an intake payment until next year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to speed up the delivery of coronavirus vaccines as quickly as possible, even if the number of cases is rising rapidly.
Every adult in England should have received the vaccination by the end of the year, a booster dose if they have been vaccinated for at least three months since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a video message to his citizens.
So far, the yield date was at the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support, so that the immigration campaign can also be accelerated in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the Omikron variant of the virus, there is a need to strengthen the impact protection, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased with a third dose.
′′ Now get lost! ′′ Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
Is the full amount refunded from the purchase price when the item is returned?
I want everyone to use pronouns
I have lost a bid.
Today the invitation came via email.
I want to respond to the email.
But unfortunately the name is not "Peter", but rather a somewhat more complicated name.
I have talked to him and, depending on where he / she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I don't know how I should write an email now.
Could you please help me?
**I am a foreigner and I don't want to see any officials over the fence.
Conclusion: everyone should think about pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books.
Four of them go.
Only that one I bought today doesn't work
Obviously, the chair had a noticeable lack of sales.
How can such a polish damage after 9 months?
Only on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it has been working since ca.
Not for 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
But there was no more.
Now you are available again and I would like to add this to your order and put it in your invoice.
When I can't help.
Content warning: I will write a little more about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something from the heart.
I (21) often come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
There is a theme that really nags at me and unfortunately too often happens that many victims do not allow themselves to be helped or think we could not help them.
I am completely clear that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that make me more angry than if I could do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue flecks of blood, the confused eyes...
But even in conversation with the perpetrator, far away from sight and hearing, I cannot all reach.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of pain, fear of leaving the social environment, fear of exposing the children to this.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is that even if they are very close to tears, they can live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to take violent action.
I often wish I could help... I know I can't.
It will never be lighter.
Please, always think of it as worth living without violence, that is so important.
Arcane on Netflix: What is the League of Legends?
Many fantasy, many complicated names, a fascinating arrangement: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends"-computerspiel-universum, is soon on Netflix.
Why are we happy about the already announced two series?
Baseball Bundesliga: MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg derby with Merlins Crailsheim
At least on youngster Johannes Patrick.
Again nothing: The Riesen in Crailsheim lost again - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with a sigh of disappointment at the loss of the cup at the beginning of October at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have a bit of rage in the wood."
After the game, however, she did not hide her disappointment - but rather cheered again in front of the 61-72 (28-38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereas the result was even more transparent than the manner of the appointment.
The referee is a statistic that summarises the entire dilemma: The three-quote betrays just 13 percent, 4 penalties (all of them by the young Johannes Patrick) with a shot and 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer came from John Patrick: "We were not focused enough after the victory at Teneriffa and we did not execute what we have trained," he said.
The ball to be beaten.
Ganz anderes reacted to his opponent Sebastian Gleim: "A pleasant game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
It felt like it was 10,000 people."
There were only 750 visitors on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they paid for it.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team to victory.
The best player I have trained, Gleim praised.
While in the Patricks team itself, the performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) struggled all the way.
Just in the last quarter (22:15) the Riesen prevented a total debacle and came even to eight points, after they had already lost 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
There is a lot of time left for happiness.
Already on Wednesday (19.00) the skyliners received the skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We had a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already reported it a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all performance claims were rejected.
We have once again been informed legally and have once again written them.
We have already reported it a half year ago.
Always like from the EI: Max Raabe is 59
He wants to seduce his audience with new interpretations of hit songs from the 20s and 30s.
Currently he is working on the program "Good Day, Love Happens" - if he can.
Max Raabe really wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig that day.
But that will not happen.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "in accordance with instructions" to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Other of his planned appearances must also come to an end, as it is said on the website of the singer, who is now 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchestra.de).
From January, the artists want to collect their 2020 term after the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, north Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe already as a child had a lot of fun.
He studied opera singing in Berlin in 1986 and together with colleagues founded the Palast Orchester.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the comedian harmonists.
He was often marked with prices.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just as his success album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) did - second place in the charts.
He has made it mainstream.
Eerie and elegant, the blonde hair tightened and looked at the mirror, Max Raabe is no longer to be seen from the current German-speaking music scene.
He has been on tour since 2020 with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück". dpa

Federal Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs Klara Geywitz: No new housing will be created through approval
The new Federal Minister of the Interior Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the establishment of large housing corporations, as it has been demanded in Berlin in a referendum.
In an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday), Geywitz said that with an agreement, there would be no single new housing, but only a change in the ownership structure.
My goal is to give my tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
For example, a dark mix from private landlords, corporations or housing companies is the best protection against a monopoly image.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left-wing parties wants to set up an expert commission, as was done with the result of the people's vote.
But if the situation does not improve, Geywitz will not be able to close talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition over further tightening in the labour market.
The coalition agreement provides for a mortgage levy until 2029, a limit on the height of terraced housing estates and the expansion of the mortgage ceiling.
I will talk to the Justice Minister to get this done as soon as possible.
If the market does not change its tune, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.

At least 100 killed in tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been caused by the US.
More than 100 deaths could be claimed in Kentucky alone.
The pictures reminded him of a war zone.
On Saturday night in the United States, several tornadoes caused severe damage and may have killed up to a hundred people.
The quake left a roughly 320-kilometer-long shadow of destruction, particularly in the state of Kentucky.
Those governors Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, where the tornado had swept through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Some of the industrial plants, chimneys are in the walls.
It is difficult to imagine that this is actually possible.
He is alone in the state of Kentucky with up to a hundred dead, the official figures are steadily rising.
Hello, I have just seen that they are selling the Vitrine #NAME#.
That is very sad.
Do you still produce?
Or is she completely out of stock?
Is it possible to order this window in another country?
until when are you going?
If the delivery cannot take place in my home, I must cancel the order!
I understand that I can only order the ceiling now and send it to Germany, where it is in the warehouse?
I had sent an article back and received a refund, and I wanted to ask if it had been received or if it was being processed, as I had not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay damages and change advertising claims
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for an emergency aid, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and offered their employees for the payment of emergency aid.
This means that they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial aid for an inspection.
Also the layout of advertising slogans to be bombarded with calls - according to the German model - should be increased.
He was transferred to a company where he worked.
This makes his situation not better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He has not even been to his old place and has been looking for something else.
You can do it too.
And that he didn't find you well at that time: naja egal.
He didn't find his job either.
There are many variables.
Do not take them.
That will then be relevant legally.
I take a screen shot.

Help in the first campaign
Boron to the top!
I milked for a group of four friends the adventure over the Greifenpass and want to lead my heroes into a campaign written for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big boogeyman is made, the booby traps and their motives written, the individual acts erased and now I am here to write the first encounter and jump over my own fences.
The premise is that the helpers should bring a wheelbarrow with goods from the gravel pit to a small village near the Thuran river.
That is where the further action will take place.
Some miles from the village, a group of goblins are to be released and locked in a fortress.
I want to give the players the opportunity to confront different forms of confrontation: witnesses, actions, threats, early warnings that always frighten the players.
Group strength: 8 common goblin, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and arrows
When not noticed, the goblins run up to the heroes in a haze and flank them on three sides, clasping the wheel in their hands while two with spears stop the wheel.
If it comes to fighting and the heroes fall, I have two solutions
The rescuers will find all unconscious and strangled from the son of the schoolmaster, a half-brother.
The car is naturally gone.
If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf with two of his knights will fight and come to the help of the heroes in the battle.
The car is still there, everything is super.
How does your Deus ex Machina solve the problem 2?
Is the encounter as a first step too much?
The Goblins will play a decisive role later, so not only cannons.
Edited: wow, I had not thought of this with so many answers, especially not with so many good suggestions and tips.
I will ensure that many of your ideas are refined and I have once more confidence in my narrative.
I put the lamp together again.
And again together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
So I would still send them back
Then you can take the cover off, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I am a fan of Sky Sport F1
Hello fans of F1, the quality on the German sky has continued to improve throughout the season, so I want to make a little air with this post.
For the first time today, in the middle of the F2-Race, the transmission was stopped to allow the F1-Reporting to begin punctually.
Although it was far from the planned start and the start failure of the time plan, one could still show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it is because of legal reasons that F1 has the right to win and must therefore restrict everything else, so that Sky DE here probably had no choice.
Still, Sky UK took the race over.
Still a small nod: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well described the difficult situation after the serious accident.
Then there was a rule violation by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher again in F1, both of whom did not know that you could change the pace under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change the tires as appropriate for the topic of Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that this is the opportunity for Verstappen.
I believe that such elemental rules should be known when commenting on F1 on pay TV.
It is not the first time this has happened, and both have simply been unable to agree on rules in this area.
In general, it does not agree with the commercial style of Roos, but the flavour is there.
But I really like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
There are also fixed lodgings, which both look like they are simply unprofessionally let, as the order of coffee at (almost tasteless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the last brings a lot of uncertainty into the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least is the advertising, which simply passes over Sky, in which Sky is the only sender in the advertising that goes where the race is, as one can follow F1TV after the race only in German without comment.
Both ServusTV and ORF do this.
These two transmitters also make less advertising in the training than Sky, and as a free TV transmitter.
Of course, you have to take gloves and safety goggles for your work, but that does not allow me to see the aftermath.
The old program of Sky Sport F1 is also very tough and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that adds F1.
Unsurprisingly, RTL makes a better job of the four races, which they still have to overcome.
So, at least, the grandiose F1 season makes a lot less fun than it would be with a boring transmitter.
I would like to hear your opinion.
Here is the link: #PRS_ORG# - Pendellooks, Messing and more expensive glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should have been delivered last week and is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it will be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me it will be sent and she has never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after relatively short time (the material has a lake in the upper part of the wall).
I want support.
Lighthouse pumps are eager to supply an aquarium with fuel.
It is also possible to set up a filter system over the air.
This series is offered in 3 variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
Here you can see the performance compared.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run all the equipment.
If you own a large aquarium, you can use pumps with more than one output so that you can connect several pumps.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model, but also offers to set an accent in the aquarium, for example with a fan (you can find it in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air blisters into a function.
Here would be a deposit, money or similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-proof construction and is designed for low-level work.
The installation is very easy.
The Lüfterpumpe will be connected via a 4/6 mm air hose to an air compressor...and it can already run.
The Lüfterpumpe should be the same, or higher than the water level and visible from the outside.
The Lüfterpumpe should be set to a lower level than the water level, so that you can set a backflow vent.
The airflow is simply divided and the ventilation is then set.
This would prevent water running back into the creek, which runs through the pump...
If the Lüfterpumpe is to be brought into use, so should you, like other Lüfterpumpe, be covered and protected against fire
The MK series pumps are complete power packs that consume little energy
Even if we say here in eBay that the delivery time is 3 days, the packages will be packed and delivered here every day.
Everything is going well, it is very fast.
We just want to warn a little bit, so that no one is surprised, just because it has been for a while.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for the whole staff, who also work in the field... of course, there is no Corona here.
Please don't rate it bad just because the delivery is delayed, which is only on the package service.
Of course, we are happy about these services, even if we say at the moment... that they are difficult
This is also very different regionally.
If you are not happy, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times.
How long does it take to buy with and without arm?
Can you also get the bone in hell?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronauts to the world all
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator and four other passengers, have made a short flight in space.
They were transported on Saturday from the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's New Shepard rocket system.
The start and landing of the 10-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a luminous blue sky, Bezos took a personal interest in the newly arrived astronauts after their return.
Welcome back, said Bezos, in a blue spacecraft, as he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Among the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers walked out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were traveling at a speed of ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who was named after the rocket system of Blue Origin, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were guests of the company, which had paid the other four passengers for their tickets: Space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and her son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not share how many of them each paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered the short flight to her father's mission.
He has worked hard in his efforts and had to do everything himself.
She just flew away, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his delight.
He would like to go back as soon as possible, said the moderator.
New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometers high
The "raketensystem" "New Shepard" is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, temporarily with great looseness, before the reusable object landed from a great fall of debris.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers over the earth as a limit to the world, but there is no binding international agreement.
It was already the third embarrassing all-out flight of Blue Origin. At first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old German.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was there, known for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's managing director, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of promoting the business with the world tourism largely without scientific research interests for the well-being of the human race and without regard to climate.

Perfect:) do I need anything else?
Do you need the tracking number in my mail?
Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject quite fascinating and also in the laboratory I am not (I already have the organic chemistry practicum behind me).
Of course, I also informed myself of this before the study about career prospects, but also at the time when I decided to study for promotion and will.
But I have doubts, especially about my professional prospects.
On one side (Studycheck etc) you hear super dubious references and the application is completely sought after, on the other side you hear from unemployed biologists and unfairly paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested in:
What is your current work?
(2) Are you happy with your work/activity?
(3) What did you study/ What did you receive?
Do you want to do it again?
Many thanks for your responses!
I am currently uncertain and may drop out of the study in 2022 and do an apprenticeship to become a specialist in information technology.
If you have experience, write it down:)
Extra stress before holidays and holiday weekends
This topic came up last week.
But I had to use my long weekend to get over it.
For now, just a post.
Not only during large holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is a great deal of stress in our work.
As it seems, there are also more brunch days before feast days.
It was: last week was Mariä Himmelfahrt, which we call "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses hold a brunch, which is semi-official.
It was a long four-day weekend at home last week.
What happened last week?
All stress.
Lively emails that still had to be delivered before the weekend, orders here, orders there, everything *of course* before the long weekend.
Because... yes?
Because "then next week" seems so long ago and that can't be?
Or because people all want to work as much as they do in a normal week?
Not only was I angry on Wednesday, but also very angry.
What should this self-contact be for celebrations?
Where are we going to have fun days when we can't get them?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite naturally so.
My question is simple: Are you just us, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed evangelical style?
Or do you know this in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld celebrates Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is happy at Christmas in her thüringian homeland - but has not yet made any gifts.
The beauty, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get ready for the party by cooking and baking with her son.
I love that, said Catterfeld.
But until then, she still had to deal with something: "The first time I didn't have any gifts, I had to make a decision now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a non-invasive procedure for the removal of the tumor and the reconstruction of the skin.
NEKTON-Bio contains all the vitamins, amino acids, minerals and 200,000 µg Biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio provides the bird with a glossy and glittery feeder.
The majority of the food poisoning incidents that occur in the catering sector are attributable to errors in feeding.
Because the feeder is made of durable material, a particularly rich and nutritious feeding of the bird is necessary for the formation of a free-flowing feather.
For a functional food change, the daily intake of vitamins, minerals and trace elements must be sufficient.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the hunting season are caused by dehydration or insufficient vitamin and mineral intake.
In the synthesis of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable relationship of the amino acids in most plant-derived fats is explicitly taken into account and compared.
While applying NEKTON-Bio, no further vitamin preparation is required.
NEKTON-Bio is completely biodegradable and can be poured over the drinking water or over the fruit juice.
Thank you, I found it
It still doesn't work
DDR locomotive model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the Lok was in service in Schlesien and Mitteldeutschland, and the very rare Lok is probably from the design of the locomotive engineer ME Heft 11/1968, which was used with locomotives and freight trains, see photos, function well, The E 95 is a heavy goods locomotive of the German Railways (DRG), which has been equipped with locomotives and freight trains for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Schleswig-Holstein network, possibly also from the construction company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
There is a locomotive in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are able to work on it
The Deutsche Reichsbahn Company had commissioned AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that should be able to haul 2,200 tons of coal and 530 tons of people with a speed of 45 kilometers per hour on this stretch.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with locomotive driving AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were the work numbers E 95 01–06.
All stood up for the Second World War and found themselves in the territory of the later DDR again.
The locomotives were repaired in the Soviet Union in 1946.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The locomotives of all six locomotives were tested at the Dessau locomotive depot.
[4] When the middle German network was being strengthened with powerful electrification, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were modified in 1959, with the remaining locomotives as spare parts.
First the E 04, E 44 and E 94 in larger numbers were built.
Only when looking at the E 94, it became clear that the workforce was not to be increased, did the E 95 return to the focus of attention.
First, the locomotives were stationed in the locomotive yard at Leipzig.
They came to work at the Halle P. terminal in 1960.
They were used in an own Umlaufplan from the Eiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated tax system for locomotives is becoming increasingly problematic with increasing age.
So it came more often that Schütze lived with Schalthandlungen.
Then the driver of the locomotive, who was constantly travelling on this locomotive, had to release the conductor during the journey.
The damage to the locomotive engines came earlier and led to months of outages at the locomotive.
[5] Since the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives available and there was no plan for a significant expansion of the electric locomotive business at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to switch to old locomotives and most freight trains, so that the E 95 was used for service.
Among them, the Deutsche Reichsbahn Electric locomotives only wanted to be manned by men, which would have caused a problem in the operation of the locomotives and the view displays from the locomotive's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn in mid 1969, the E 95 01 was withdrawn as the last service on October 5, 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives were stopped at the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the forthcoming museum locomotive E 77 10 as a locomotive depot at the Halle Hauptbahnhof.
It took some time for those responsible at the railway to be convinced that the E 95 was a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the construction of the locomotive began, with the goal of presenting it to a vehicle inspection in the RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has been a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986 the locomotive was completed internally.
The locomotive will be displayed in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have worked on the maintenance of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new inner and more refined lack. The transformers were checked and five locomotives were capable of operating.
The locomotives were used until 1945 on the Schlesische Gebirgsbahn and the accompanying freight trains, where they were accustomed to work on the basis of their inevitable duties and the lack of supplies.
In February 1945, the machines were moved to the middle German net after Leipzig.
The main deployment area was first Schlesien
Work model H0 in OVP, function good, it is necessary to do optical processing at the location in Eigenarbeit, assembled, with spikes, Kellergeruch!!!, very rarely the work model, very small output - maybe the production capacity also comes from the small clothing firm ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packages can display labels and labels.
Yes, the F-parts are it
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle box is held by two hands. Unfortunately, these are too short and the box cannot be mounted on the hands.
What are we doing now?
I cannot build the bed.
The middle box is held by two fingers, which are unfortunately inaccurately produced.
The middle part does not pass through the intended halter.
I also received new emails.
When will they be lost?
No, not clear.
That is, according to the montage, the right of the form, they were only too short
But that's equal.
The main reason is to fulfill their purpose
For me they are not flat
Can I get this delivered?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two injured and serious damage
Two people were injured in a house fire in Oberbayern.
On Sunday, the police announced that a serious damage had occurred in the six-story Eurobridge.
The fire had probably started from a carport on the adjacent terraced house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
According to the information, two residents were taken to hospital on Sunday with minor burns.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not go from a preliminary fire prevention.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has continued the investigation.
But it comes much later
And I still have to pay for shipping costs
To combat fake news - CEO of Biontech publishes photo of a fight
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first inspection on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021
Until now, Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin has not publicly acknowledged his pregnancy.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona test.
The illness of a friend has moved him, Sahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based Biontech company, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving an injection against the coronavirus.
There were false information in social media that I did not actually commit suicide.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 professors from the Biontech-Pfizer Institute," Şahin wrote in a LinkedIn post on Friday.
For a few months, friends have been asking me to post a photo of me in which I will be smiling to deflect these false accusations."
So far, he has rejected this, because the communication should not have focused on him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply shocked when I realized that an old school friend is currently fighting for his life.
He fights against a severe Covid-19 infection and is on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not impressed, wrote Şahin.
He did not ask for the reasons.
However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often caused by inaccurate information and lack of trust."
Fear only comes with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
In an interview with Deutsche Welle, Uğur Şahin says he is not guilty.
However, the video was released in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself stated.
At that time, Şahin said, "I am not allowed to get the injection at the moment."
There is a prioritisation in Germany for the evacuation of the cabin.
The prioritisation has now been lifted for a while - and the Biontech boss has apparently agreed to three times.
Fire in Umspannanlage: Ten thousand people without power
In many municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
There was a fire extinguished.
After a fire with serious damage in an emergency station, hundreds of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg region in North Rhine-Westphalia had to wait around 24 hours without power.
On the evening of the fire, 41,000 affected residents and residents in several communities were evacuated.
The Westnetz transmitter reported that numerous notchstones were in operation until the large-scale disturbance was finally stopped at the late evening.
Firefighters and volunteers from the THW provided support in the communities.
Authorities put seats in schools and called for help from neighbors.
The donor thanked the victims for their courage and the helpers for their work.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have been marked by significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected communities, the district, the fire brigade and the THW for the courageous use of force," said the head of the department of primary technical services, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will still take a few days, as the Westnetz Monteure were able to restart some services provisionally, he explained.
According to company data, a technical defect led to the fire.
Strom flies again
According to information from Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at 7.15 p.m. severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt power station at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There are necessary repairs and repairs there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt power line has been made.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is again restored.
Since Saturday at 8 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have once again heard the sound of music.
Another 20,000 residents from Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were stopped at around 3.30pm.
Since 23.15, the victims of the accident have also been affected by the storm.
Over 80 Westnetz and partner companies were employed.
The authorities had also called for help on Saturday afternoon after the completion of a notary service for important buildings.
It is now important that the citizens work together in their neighborhoods to care for older or alone people, and share information with the local fire department when help is needed, said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
At the construction and operation of Notstrom aggregates, the residents of the old hamlet were the focus.
In addition, according to information from the authorities, temporary accommodation has been set up in schools for all people who were not able to provide for themselves or who require medical treatment in connection with a medical treatment.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold.
Can I buy and pay in euros?
It is the daydress #PRS_ORG# in blue.
I hope you have a nice day and stay healthy ♡
I can't mount it on the table.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 presentations.
We wanted everyone with a table with a diameter of #NUMBER#
We have gained 155 cm in height.
Today my #PRS_ORG# came, but I cannot copy it and thus reduce it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise I have to send them back as they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy with a reply
That is really easier!
Then we do it!
Would you like me to send you the photo by mail?
The repair has now been completed.
I already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find a so low quality signature almost unbelievable.
This is not true
Northern combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to give up once again to the demanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with great anticipation after the ski jump.
Return of the application number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both installed and used the version 4.5...
Could it be that they have already faced problems
It seems like it was bought with my #PRS_ORG#, too.
If I open it, ups!
This document cannot be opened.
The file may be reported to the customer service.
When I can recognize it, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work on both sides!
To ensure that the color of the paint is uniform and clean, you should rinse the tiles with some seive water, smell the water and drain it.
Before you bring the pinwheel the first time with a new color, it is recommended to have 2 to 3 stripes.
You can't do this anymore at the later stage of the building or on a jogging bottle.
The first crack on the wall
Tie the thread evenly next to the thread.
Later, small differences in color were corrected.
Shake with the pin.
This creates unrealistic areas.
Model is not a gun.
Started with the yellow colors.
The dark could have been spotted earlier.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come to a close with a separate pin.
Otherwise, it can come to unsightly metal shards if they are mixed with normal colors.
Leave the parts to soak for a day before you wash them.
The models are decorated with decals or pictures.
From security signs on aircraft to ship names and signs on automobile models: the decals give the model the last clue.
Bring the decals in the right order, as long as the equipment is still good to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be made lighter before it is built into the stump.
Time, patience and a calm hand are still more important than the right tool, such as a saw, a drill and a lathe.
Schneide needed a decal for every one of them, and she gave them to you.
Decals are also called waterproofing pictures, because you want to see your backside with water as soon as possible, so that the damage paper will turn dark through the hole.
Then you only take a small piece of the paper and put it on the corresponding place on the model (which you also marked before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you take the receipt paper away.
Attention: Check that the picture is sitting correctly before you take it out of the paper, so that it doesn't grow on your finger, knit or even tear.
Waste water with a household budget.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time, after which I don't want to read it anymore and must withdraw and register and load the book again and look for the place where I have read it.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I receive this by email?
For all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 individual packages to me
Thanks anyway!
Then I will buy something else.
Will I get the problem solved?
Child abuse in PKV / What is a "Insurance Fall"?
Hello together,
We were in child psychology for a while, now that it is about the appointment with the PKV, this suddenly stops.
The series:
We had applied for child protection at the time of the PKV and received the benefit over three attempts.
The attempts were limited (for example, by time, success, etc.).
The first attempt led to successful pregnancy and birth and was registered with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get another child, and carried out two (successful) attempts, but we still did not get rid of the PKV.
We again requested the cost reimbursement at the PKV and were granted 3 further attempts.
After several further attempts (we have carried out more attempts than indicated by the PKV), we reach the invoices at the PKV and receive the brutal surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2 + 3), the PKV wants only 3 attempts.
The reason: with the birth of the second child, the first attempt failed.
The second child was a new insurance claim.
However, according to AGB, the "Insurability begins with the treatment, ends when treatment is no longer necessary."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who has the right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are allowed) or us (there are 5 attempts to make)?
* The PKV had to point out that with a birth the further attempts would fail?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance risk?
The infertility (due to closed eggs) will not be passed on by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here.
Many thanks for your help!
Could you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can find them again?
In order.
We will no longer order anything from them.
If you add the payments from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you have obviously lost a good customer.
This should be continued with your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the college told me that the refund had been requested and now you tell me that I have to wait for it.
I can certainly do nothing to prevent the comedian completely from coming to me
Please see the screenshot of what the college wrote
It is clear and obvious that the refund was requested and I have not received any refund per #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you have lost two main customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our home.
That will no longer be done.
No, the defect only emerged after a few months.
The building must be used normally.
Otherwise you cannot sell him as a brick.
Unconditionally, the 24-month warranty applies.
No, it is not possible for me to pack another way.
I will get rid of him and be able to put him on the company's books.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be marked with additional advertising hockers, but unfortunately we cannot find them for you.
Can you help?
Top of the week: The best low budget films
What exactly is a low-budget film, there is no general definition with precise budget limits.
The Wikipedia has said the following:
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little or no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find a wealth of low-budget films on the net, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know an interesting representative of this category?
What is the purpose of this?
And what do you probably not like at all?
He is a very good customer, has already built two houses with his own furniture.
Wanted the best price for the large couch Odelle.
The delivery was once again delayed, is this now also necessary?
Many thanks
With friendly greetings
If there is no telephone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the Warteposition...I give it a miss because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half-Sieg" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to the EU expert in the conflict with the Russian regime, Raphael Bossong, a "half-success" can be announced.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelischen Pressedienst (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation, the researcher of the Berlin-based Science and Politics Foundation (SWP) explained.
This situation - Belarus is not quite small, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably go on for a while.
The approach to the people on the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
It seems that there is a "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole does not agree, this costs the basic rights.
This development also weakens the union.
She apparently cannot be stopped if a member state puts itself in the head, to make her do something, as Poland, which has not once admitted the EU border protection agency Frontex to access the border.
In addition, the EU will pay a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, Bossong says: an agreement on asylum policy will be strengthened, as the line "boundary protection, boundary protection, boundary protection" has been strengthened.
New attempt at border crossing
According to information from the Polish border guards, migrants are again trying to reach the Polish territory via Belarus.
On Sunday, 55 migrants were arrested and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authorities said.
The Polish officials were attacked by the migrants with stones during the incident.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, 52 border guards attempted to cross the border within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had already crossed the border on the evening before.
In recent months, thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU or attempted to do so.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko of being the mastermind in Minsk, and has threatened to lock him into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have cut off borders.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that brought migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners have arrived in refugee camps in the origin countries of the people to prevent them from escaping.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
The EU has turned its market power into a choke, and its credibility has been undermined with tough restrictions and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk also has to account for domestic political costs.
The Russian society is probably not convinced that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial F1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen should have taken two penalty points during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial F1 Finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has claimed victory.
The silver medal was the same as two bronze medals in the last Grand Prix of the year.
The protest is based on a supposed act of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he should have been allowed to pass.
Another appeal was lodged against the valuation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not complied with.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the last race in Mercedes and was preparing for his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver occurred shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the driver of the car in front of him had overtaken him.
I check this.
I speak to the bank and call again to you
Thanks for the support

She is gone, living in a house on the coast and listening to the gentle laughter at her front door.
I have sent the contact form for payment of an article, but no email confirmation or similar.
My question is whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your clumsy chat and lost expensive goods from China.
Your mistake, which you are aware of and not all from our budget.
Contact the woman #NAME#.
I can't talk to them every day
We had told and agreed yesterday that I would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a renewed order of the #PRS_ORG# evening meal and a thank-you note.
This email has not yet arrived.
The package wants to bring it today.

Yes, wow, then you are not so similar to Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution is basically lost.

However, these data only apply for exactly specified conditions, which rarely apply to the use conditions.
To make the most of your Lupe, we ask you to pay attention to the information in the table "Technical Data" (see Use Guide in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including flashlamps.
Through an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
In order to achieve the optimal conditions for use - close to the eye - reflections on the lens areas are less accurate.

Yes, but it was before.

Tanning sale in Schönwolde: Women in the community of Krembz are looking for Christmas trees
Landwirt Frank Diers has already experienced so many strange situations at tanning.
Once a man is even without his partner back home, because both of them cannot agree.
Every year he grows 2000 plants.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some curious situations.
This made the preview time more exciting, he says.
And with the voucher??
Otherwise, I'm going away as a customer?!
However, I have received a defective delivery and now have to pay the full price for it.
Then I will also evaluate this!
We don't need to discuss the best court here, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both are made from meat, which is cooked on a spit.
And both have their names.
In German, for example, it would sound like the word "Dreher", which doesn't sound so cheerful.
Problems with Glasfaser + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass ceiling in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wi-Fi network.
I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection before and used Devolo DLan, which up to a couple of outages was capable of 50 Mbit reception and transmission.
The new fibre optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan Modul, which is connected to the FritzBox.
However, the other DLan Modul, which is sending the WiFi, is not sending the full 500 anymore, but I am getting rid of the module in my house, so less is coming (so I use a stack dose that takes up 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet is now even slower than before (~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which seems to use a new technology.
This was much easier than the DLan, but also here there were similar losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is lost with glass fiber?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely important to have LAN cable still in the house.
I am really surprised, so I have created an extra account here.
Therefore, I would be more happy with an answer.
When is the time to change the Giro account
Who thought that now would be the time for the Giro Contest to start, is surprised.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the interest rate hikes of the past with their customers, the fees for negative interest rates continue to fall.
For example, Deutsche Bank would have to pay a limit of 100,000 euros for a relatively long time.
Now she has halved the gratuity and even paid for the day's wages.
In a first step, the limit was only set for customers of the Sparte Postbank Group - at 50,000 euros for Giro accounts and 25,000 euros for daily wage accounts.
However, these lower fees apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "renewed individual contracts with customers."
The Commerzbank had already run up a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as with ING Germany.
The Direct Bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has suspended the fees in two stages, first at 50,000 euros, and now at 25,000 euros.
Nevertheless: More than 100 banks now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less after figures from the online portal Verivox.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, who have even taken legal action against this regulation in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court.
Now it is being discussed in the banks whether the Institute should be able to form reserves - for the case that the upper instancies also have to declare negative interest rates and have to refund millions of bank customers.
The table for 8 people was delivered instead of the table for 6 people.
This is for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a full beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is like a mountain and a trek.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter."
For them, who made 2021's "Friends" reunion and the continuation of its series "The Morning Show" a sensation, this success is the result of a lot of discipline and work.
For her appearance, a whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers are on hand.
Nevertheless, as Aniston, you can have a chip on the day (yes, right readed: a real chip from the box).
To fly the hearts of both female and male fans is really a miracle.
Maybe because she just had a lucky break - and still is looking for love.
And the Babywunsch from the list.
She had been constantly asked when she would be a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked have no idea what is lost with me personally, medically, why I cannot.
It was really exhausting.
Keep hoping that also success and glory will be happy.
Unworthy end of a career for Räikkönen
Kimi Räikkönen's retirement from Formula 1 was still a surprise.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne took the handkerchief out and watched the stream from the heart.
That was it.
After a tire failure and a light band damage, Räikkönen had to withdraw his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the Motorsport class.
His wife Minttu and the two children also left the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the World Championship in 2007 in Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix championships, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich holds 60. World Cup victory - did not win in the double bob - Sport
The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen's mark of 94 successes is the goal of the bobpilot.
I had that figured out, I had to win at least 15 races for the season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two wins in two days at Winterberg.
He only stopped the attack by Johannes Lochner on Saturday, in which he went from third to first.
Then he changed something about the material setting and ran a bigger lead with 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team, Thorsten Margis (SV Halle) and Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he defeated the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Österreicher Benjamin Maier.
We are taking a greater risk today and have been rewarded, said Friedrich, who also scored his 22nd victory in Serie.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in second place behind Platz 2.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach came fourth in the first race at eighth place.
If I knew what he was doing, I would do it too, said Lochner.
Not with a home victory - podium for Jamka
For the women, Laura Nolte lifted the third season win in the two bob.
After it was only for the fourth place on the day in the monobob, she raced on Sunday at the German downhill with Anschieberin Deborah Levi at the World Cup.
Two-time Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thüringen came with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, on second place.
She booked the first podium spot in this winter.
The Wiesbaden woman Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, the first place in the world cup, I am super happy that Mariama took me with her.
I am very happy with the development.
Because there is still a lot of potential at the start, but today's start times were okay," Burghardt said, stressing that "it is not just attacks, but there is also a lot to do drums around".
However, he admitted that he was a little angry about the not quite perfect driving, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the ceiling already in the warehouse and could now buy it!!!
What should I do?
I have not received him and therefore also not released him, so I finally asked.
Last year I had other problems and never had time for that.
And now he confessed what had really upset me.
Look at the chat, it went about the Asare Sitzbank.
I want to give it back and then order again, because it is already reduced :)
When will the delivery be started?
There was no longer a long delivery time on your website
Not until I get tipped
You were arrested yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the false fire.
But we still want the royal module, just a new unblemished
And not cancel the entire order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello beautiful girls and girls and women,
I have something I just want to write and maybe it is the one - or the other...
I am 24, have PTBS, full-time student and dog mama - forgetting for a moment that my dog does not bark or goes to the kindergarten.
My friend (since 6 years together) is sick, has had a brain tumor and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we have a lot of fun and it was nice.
I helped him clean (since hand is in the association).
He is coldly dressed and we see less (1 - 2 x week) what makes me very happy with my pleasures and love.
My dog has just had a bath, I have groomed him and now he is lying in his cage and has relaxed a bit after I had washed him and combed him.
I love all alone with my sister and mother, and she is just gone for a month.
Now we are also getting housework, which we naturally share.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS illness is just fine, I am halfway well treated and coming back.
Not good, but I'm coming without and I'm almost symptom-free.
My uni is demanding a lot (for me), so tomorrow at 15 I have a written test for which I have not prepared anything and tomorrow afternoon Anatomy class for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week, on Tuesday, I will have a daily examination, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head, because there is no more place.
Also my week goes like this: Only until the evening, then is the weekend.
But then does that go on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Just...
And so it remains forever.
I think I am just stressed out so much that I need these emotional high points because otherwise I would pack it in.
I somehow feel guilty and "chaotic," but I don't...
Do you also go?
Honestly, I am so grateful that I don't have to work.
In fact, I am so grateful that I cannot express it in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my PTB.
I believe that this has also partly to do with mental load from women and therefore I feared that I would find here sad mothers...
I wish you a happy evening, the week is almost over!
Today I have received my order, unfortunately the whole other color plus the top layer is crumpled and the table has creased.
In the first delivery, the colour was exactly as on the website.
We are very excited!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we are going to sit at the table now, will I still have other colors or how?
The email to cancel was sent on December 26th.#NUMBER#.
In the next two times.
But it was not confirmed.
One thing was completely different: at that time I was taught in school that many religious teachers did not believe in God and that it was just another subject like math or astronomy.
For me it was always a bit strange, perhaps also because I was baptized as a Christian and I have always believed so.
How are you doing?
Maybe you can also mention your colleagues at work or at school.
In principle I understand the difference between private and professional and it is nice to meet.
There is also a learning plan.
But it is just as easy to have a physicist who does not believe in relativity theory.
What brings one to believe in religion when one doesn't?
Is culture true or false?
The question is not private.
Can it be changed or not? Write in English, I can also understand it
That is already very long, then I would look at it
Good, thanks.
I expect a reply by the earliest possible date, possibly next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Help with film search
Hello people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it is a film for young people.
There are two time periods (or parallel worlds) in the film.
For one, the modern (real world).
For others, the past (or the dead world).
There is a young woman.
And in the country of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the Caribbean).
For some reason, the roads are closed and there is a reaction.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Reich of the Dead, who wants to live in this world.
The transfer is also the grave of the soldier.
At the end, both soldiers fought each other.
If you say so, I am grateful for any answer.
Our children have only slept on the couch from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive: D
Enjoy yourself.
So a child holds more than you think.
Concerned that everything is going wrong, not a screwdriver, more often than not, but no minutes of observation.
That makes you very happy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good Matratze.
No kiss.
Achso and we had no pillow, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when they play.
Is the head on the side?
Can something be done from the ashes?
Or is it with the face directly in the mat?
You can check to see if everything is OK.
We all grew up and when my husband came to the world, it was like gang and gossip that you put the kids on the couch to sleep.
In addition, we are already 'Stammkunde' for you and have already bought a lot of articles
But why are you only offering me 20 euros?
Hello, I have already written to a colleague of yours and so far no reply.
It is about my Kleiderschrank, which has arrived (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right-wing party does not pass in the polls.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The crisis is not currently being used.
To make it quite clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply that the politics of this sender is now under all suspicion.
Fast every format is sponsored (ok), but then at the same time go on a big tour.
It was said that you were an "independent" Internet sender.
Quote Arno: "You don't want to be a running joke."
What are you now?
An 0815 Werbesender, who is trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marahs Do's & Don'ts.
The natural for everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
The people should certainly continue to protest.
One Krogmann is completely lacking empathy and is trying to make a profit from the action with the exploded rooms.
How should I find everything?
If you don't like it, I find it terrible.
I would like to thank you for calling, as my denture was defective.
Corpus breach by compromised delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a substitute for bread or just as a snack – my little friend is very versatile.
Kirschkern cakes are a traditional home delicacy for warm weather activities, as kirschberne cakes are very good at absorbing heat and can be re-distributed.
The remarkable interior decorations can be easily hidden in the micro-well or in the back of the toilet.
The thin connection makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the children feel comfortable even if it doesn't work so well for them.
The Kirschkern Kissen with connection is only suitable for the following application areas:
Before the kiss, check for unusual smells, spots or bruises, and promptly inform the other person.
Please take the interior furniture out of the connection!
In the microwell at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (according to the manufacturer's data!)
The warmth is distributed evenly in the cake!
Afterwards, the interior was cleaned up.
With the first flushes, there may be a slight increase in fertility, but this disappears with repeated applications.
You should stick to the given warning, as longer periods or higher energy consumption can lead to damage (flammable and explosive danger!).
Check whether the kissing in the microwire allows for a contraction of cervical products in the advertising of the manufacturer.
After putting the recalled baby food back in the container, please check the temperature of the food on your arm!
Do not use the knife for acute and chronic, incurable or fatal diseases, cancerous growths, blood clots and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced sense of pain.
For most types of cancer, heart disease, venereal disease, diabetes or tumors, and a gynecologist, please consult a doctor before treatment.
If Nähte opened and lost a bone, you should immediately notify the product and the lost bone, and unsubscribe for children.
If the product is used for babies under one year, the temperature of the child should be regularly monitored during application to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product will be reported to the manufacturer and the responsible authority of the country in which the offender is located.
The connection is secure and at 30 ° C in the machine is possible.
Please note the safety symbol on the product!
Darmstadt after second - Pauli in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream of returning to the football Bundesliga.
This time Hannover 96 is working from the table.
For Ingolstadt, it is also not the third coach.
Joy in Darmstadt after the late victory in the spies game, happiness in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and disappointment in Ingolstadt after the unfortunate start under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Yesterday evening my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my internet.
I bought this a few months ago, so it should still work.
I thought that the network could also be used to operate.
The battery is dead and the laptop does not start despite being plugged in.
Then I took the battery out, but nothing happened here either.
Do you have ideas?
New battery is ordered, but how can I use the laptop on the internet?
Is that what else is broken?
Many thanks for your help!
I want to deliver the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I buy it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But we don't know how high the seat is.....
Is it often on tour and despite all the equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design no problem!
The 20 liter tankers also feature larger photo equipment without problems, which can be secured with the polished FlexFold panels.
And what you need in the evenings remains well organised thanks to practical access to the individual configurable interior space, which can be combined and separated from the photograph.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
This is reflected in the minimalist design - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some of the most innovative solutions to protect the interior of the backpack and still allow for quick access to photo editing.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally over the zipper, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, a robust solution for effective protection that has already been mentioned in the messenger bags.
In the closure clasp is a closure clasp made of metal with a passable anchor at the front of the sack.
In contrast to most rucksacks, Peak Design has considered various "fill levels" here: there are actually four anchor points, stabilized, into which the strapped one can be inserted.
If the bag is full, you just take the top one, it is rather empty, a bit more.
Claps are also magnetic.
So the bag can also be closed securely without the key.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, everyday backpacks: in addition to the pocket clip, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of being on top - you no longer have to feel it!
At the same time, this lively detail increases the all-day durability of the bag enormously: If you don't only take your photo, but also your daily necessities or travel gear with you.
In the everyday backpack you can individually configure the internal space (more below) and thus both problem-free separated - and by the two recent openings also independent of this.
So you can also take the backpack from the right side of the body, for example, to take a picture of the camera on the right side of the main face, while the day's things will stay in the left side of the backpack and not get in the way.
Beachcombers, uninvolved witnesses, helped.
And when the outer layer of the bag is made from 100 percent recycled nylon, the content itself will crack when it goes to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I missed the email from her support.
#NAME# sent me an email to confirm the appointment
Contact was made after the mission to deliver the false goods.
So far I have not received any news.
I would like immediate intervention.
I am writing now with the third support employee, and I have not gone any further than to confirm that I received an email as proof.
It is the reception of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#
Is it true that the Schrank could be delivered again?
For me it is not an option...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
Wish you a nice evening
Hello, my number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp as I requested
Please call me
If you give me the voucher, I will immediately give you a larger order, but I have kept the damaged furniture and not returned it.
And I did not notice that the previous year was different from how I thought it would be, and I did not have the time or the opportunity to think about it and talk about it.
But the damage I have suffered as a customer and I do not accept it.

Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered a boiling brook in the water at the southern end of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news soon spread and the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49 erupted.
Thousands came from Nah and Fern and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and flowering cities in the country.
Shops were closed, people were beaten, and saloons and hotels closed almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was: "Coloma or Bust!"
In this game you are a pioneer who is searching for a name in the West.
You want to find gold, recruit workers, sell horses and build companies.
You will also be able to find out about the event, the accompanying rainfall and the adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other Pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You must meet your pioneer colleagues to avoid getting into trouble with the rest of them.
Coloma is a tough strategy game with many reasons for victory.
You have to choose your actions at the same time, you have to hold on to their resources and build a table that is working more and more for you ("engine building").
The buildings on your table allow you to be more efficient, to hold additional actions or to change rules for your gun.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plinth, you can develop your individual style with careful adjustments.
Coloma played over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), from 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year when the official state of California was established).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
While each round will select the players home and at the same time select a location on the game plan where they can carry out actions, they can.
Afterwards, her selection will be revealed and she will place her pioneers on the passable location.
If a location has the most soldiers, it gets a bonus!
This deactivates half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then, the players switch actions, for example winning resources, driving cars, creating mines, searching for flights, building bridges, opening shops and positioning gunners.
If all actions are completed, the Pioneers will return.
The seller starts each round at a new location and changes the available actions.
This goes on for a long time, until the seller has moved five times, so every location has been hidden and the year ends.
There is a shooting, in which the players must defend themselves against a violent gang.
If the players have equipped themselves with enough revolvers and paid the bandits regularly, they receive rewards.
If you try to escape, you will receive reduced wages or end up in prison.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the scoring is completed.
The player with the most points wins!
I take up to 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm of the mail type, courier (bundled).
Most of all, DPD insures it and with delivery supervision (played with flies, wrapped in paper).
If you are a smoker, then I can send you a card for 2 euros, which is 100% free of charge.
Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse of power
The ARD documentation is now on my Twitter timeline, and I have seen it right away.
The child psychologist Michael Winterhoff is a regular guest in talk shows and holds European awards.
With his book "Why Our Children Are Tyrants" (2008), he launched a fierce debate on education.
Former patient: now he has raised serious accusations against him.
Please pass on the film, it is difficult to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible adults should never, never, never try to take power over the child.
Our goal must always be to provide the child with room for his development and the framework for the child so large that it is as comfortable and possible as possible in the situation.
Brrr, I still feel it.
Holetschek: States call for three times the test obligation for convicted prisoners
Health ministers from the states want to decide at their next meeting on a national path for the introduction of the test obligation for three times married couples.
We need to know quickly whether and when the test obligation can be imposed for three times, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, the 'Bild am Sonntag'.
The removal of 2G plus for three times a day is not only medically acceptable, but also provides an additional incentive, said Holetschek.
German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has announced that he will make a proposal at the Health Minister's Conference on Tuesday. − afp
Also I want to return the lamp
How do I do it best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't make any more purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Up, it is a mistake.
The purchase on the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated the data.
Where can this be?
What you describe as *awareness* is called *consciousness*.
These are produced with a frequency of ca. 1 to 1000.
Most often, it comes to hearing voices, seeing pictures, and the rarest to feel pain.
Relevant for this topic: seizures are operations that involve a high rate of awareness, as you protect the child to the exclusion of narcotics.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned at the narcotics conference.
Certain anesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) have a slightly increased risk.
**Edit**: Love all of you, this comment of mine describes Awareness correctly, but it had no definition at all.
Didn't read his comment.
The chair is however defective.
Because the 20 euros are also not helping us.
These are legal weapons.
The absolute minimum would be to take the faulty chair back.
This is standard in the eCommerce sector as well.
Check again to see if you can at least get the defective chair back.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose some money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not replied to.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice, it is stated that the goods will be delivered to my home.
The sender is Company #NAME#.
I just called there.
He told me that they would only deliver it before the gate - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I must cancel the order, as I don't know who can carry the heavy furniture in the first stock.
Didn't I call?
I had a question formulated
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies at the age of 97
He has become a theater critic and an administrator.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, fresh: "A man will get older."
The disturbing diary of a long-distance departure from the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle has led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the lecture comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I am here already bearing witness to my life."
There are various types of palettes.
One of the most common are wooden pallets, which are mainly used as packing material in European countries.
They will be certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported from Austria every year will not be revealed

Rolling tips and tricks
I had here a week ago many great tips for the perfect Gulasch.
That was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and yummy!
Also thanks again:)
Now I have come to the taste and want to roam the first time at Christmas.
Tomorrow I will set up a pension fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Remark: I don't have the right, but only a big top.

The Verstärker of the VT+ Series offers a unique power level regulator, with which you can adjust the sound pressure without changing the gain and compression.
Further up, it is already clear that you can even float the power level regulator with the power level regulator even if it is turned off.
Thanks to the power level regulator, the total potential of the VT+ series can be used in all situations.
The bookcase can also be used as a line of sight.
The following signal will be processed with a box simulation, so that you can get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression when using a speaker or when taking direct calls.
You can connect a CD player or MP3 player to the Aux port, so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
There is also a tuner function on board - you do not need a separate stethoscope.
Anyone who spends extra money on a VFS5 Fußtaster will be able to hear the sounds also easily by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and adjust the tempo of the largely compatible effects.
This is actually unavoidable for live use.
With its new power pack, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But that was not the case with others.
Is there a possibility to send the lamp back?
Because it is so low?
Also I would send them back.
Can you help me further?
And the comedy?
Will we get another update on the exact delivery date?
Hello, are you already on the #PRS_ORG# stage?
If not, I would be happy with a check or voucher.
Maybe I find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need.
I had received my order and had assumed that shrapnel was part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# Mirror (Tür) on the planned keys.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the deadline has not been met
Is there a premium customer status with Euch?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
According to Iranian sources, progress has been made in negotiations over the resumption of the international nuclear agreement.
Both sides are meeting shortly to agree on the topics that should be on the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", because initially there was not even unity over the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the renewal of the union were almost completed.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia took part in the negotiations.
Also a US delegation is in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen overcomes Sachsen - federal state now becomes the highest Corona-infected state
Thuringia has liberated Saxony and is currently the highest incidence in the country.
As one of the federal states, the value is over 1000 marks.
As one of the federal states, Thuringia has registered over the weekend the name of 1000 Corona cases.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value of 1025 new infections to 100,000 residents.
In Sachsen, which has always been the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the verdict in Thüringen was low, but it also included the value of 1000.
In Thüringen, 2242 new cases of the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths were reported within a day.
On Sunday, 200 people were treated intensively in hospitals for Covid-19.
At weekends, it can get messy.
In addition, the health authorities have been overstretched for weeks and are now barely able to cope with the influx of new cases.
That I understand.
As the delivery only starts in March, it may be possible until then.
I have to take it out and put it in the package and deliver it to the post, was that?
Do I have to do anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, so I write to you.
I would like to accept the transmission on my own costs.
The 8 euro tip is a fair amount.
It's time for changes
Bundestag greets me, I am a/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Where is the post here?
If you look at the activity in recent months, you can see that it is not extinct.
We have arrived in a winter storm and have spent several months in the lake.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, where is it?
For the most part, it should be linked to the dissatisfaction, as things are laid out here and as we generally stand up for it.
In the past few days, the impression has grown that many here still have beer on the MBundestag.
#What we must change
At this point, the community is asking around the MBundestag, which wants to live this life.
The challenge came from u/edizVEVO, which has been focusing on this project in the last few days and has discovered, simply put, cheetahs.
After a similar move, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I also want to call on everyone to take part, so that this project can also have a future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can meet and work on specific things.
You can access the server through this link.
Purpose:
* How should the MB state function in the future?
* What should be changed / altered / removed?
* What should we do in the future after going abroad?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair sales system?
I am quite sure that I have forgotten something, but it is not bad, so we have ended the discord at the end.
If you have time and desire, come to the Discord, work with and decide democratically about the future.
I have sent you a lamp shade that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/clogged for my taste.
For this reason, I have already sent you another attachment.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the thin wire.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I still have a question: the daydress #PRS_ORG#, is there also in size, so in 240/240, for example?
#PRS_ORG# must still be able to guarantee that the error will be corrected.
And I want you to leave now.
I did not have a planned packing, but I will be able to remove it as soon as possible - they must click on #PRS_ORG# to see how it can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a cancellation.
Is there a guide for the assembly?
How long would I have to wait for this to happen and for me to decide whether to accept it?
How does she respond to the question, which she calls vegan?
Today I had a talk with a colleague I liked.
She herself has been vegetarian for a while, and is probably not eating meat at all now.
I have also been vegetarian for a few years.
On the question of whether I always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned step, I honestly answered without much thought.
And indeed, I had long thought that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but eventually realized that I was also supporting animal farming.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that she had mutiny on her side, she defended vegetarianism and said that she knew where her meat came from and reduced it as a vegetarian animal.
Now I ask myself if my answer was too “plump”?
How does she respond to the question?
If the feeling of being a vegan is quickly brushed off and conflicts arise, without wanting to address it.
There is a harmonious vegetarian woman (;
This is not an exception to Article 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not comply with the legal requirements for remote work.
I am not collecting my returns at the designated date, which is #PRS_ORG#.
Because I cannot be at the site, this also does not change.
Could you please provide an alternative date?
Since the 1st of February #NUMBER#, I have been meeting again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for Water Treatment: 45,000 Euro grant from the State
The Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, immediately approved a subsidy of 45,000 euros for the new water treatment vehicle of the voluntary fire brigade of Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, is 135,000 euros.
Good and important investment in security.
I am happy that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us here, says Lahnsteins mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle will be used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
They fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, the boom of the hotelschifffahrt on the Rhine and Mosel and the continuing increase in the use of the river as a recreational flow contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then pretended to have problems.
I cannot open the book.
However, he followed his recommendations, synchronised, deleted and the app was not loaded again.
I am a bit frustrated because I have already spent a lot of time on this and hope now to help.
Okay, then so.
I would like to order three articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG#.
Can I set a date in the order form?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the previously measured values at 21°C ± 3°C, 50%- 80% humidity and the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery were determined.
The values can vary depending on the type of lamp, age and location.

Thanks for that at least, that you are putting the whole thing together here, I have also spent almost a decade in the public service in a similar activity, we talked about weapons in the trial, I don't want to get into that anymore!
The question of right and left always finds me very confused.
Essentially, one should say that the state service comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should actually be clear to everyone.
It should also be clear to everyone that, in addition to the uniform and weapons, people should also fear conservatives magically.
But these groups are also represented when it just sounds like my experience after a conservative attitude, and are proud of Germany and feel they are being overly treated, even if this policy seems to be intended for them. They just want to be treated normally.
Back to the rights, of course, as police and armed forces are also a part of society, you will also find extreme rights there, that they are allowed to express their opinion openly or even openly violate state-of-the-art plans and even annoy me.
Of course, it comes before that even policemen and soldiers, who had often been deployed abroad, had to pause and sometimes say things that were controversial and politically incorrect.
There is also the risk that right-wing sympathisers will meet and exchange gifts.
However, wherever my opinion is well received and also with political education and enlightenment for the whole region!
Germany is so very international tricked and that is also good so my opinion is that we should not have allowed right-wingers and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I did not know the other corb, I also ordered it on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
As I asked, it was not sold.
I have already booked in November.
But it was confirmed in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer deliverable.
I have previously met with #NAME#.
Instead, you could send the other #PRS_ORG# Korb for #NUMBER# Euro to Germany or is this Korb in Germany also available?
I always find you as a partner company.
But above the forest floor are two deep caves, filled with something reddish

Ordered by a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been employed for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-directed, I have little free time), but I have learned more bad than right in my life to keep my household clean and tidy.
There are always phases when everything feels right, and then and when I pack it up and I go on and put it away.
But it is never so "that someone could come and visit".
My husband is (fortunately) also not better, he just destroys me, but at least he pays the rent.
The kitchen is still cleaned every time we cook.
Has it made it easier for you to have a child?
We haven't worked on it yet, and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
Because I don't have any interest, it doesn't bother me that much, as long as no visitors come and c. b. always have fresh clothes there and the kitchen is usable.
Did you have a bigger orgasm with a child or did you stay clamped?
Enjoy your responses.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-inflicted personality disorder?
I have made a training in the field of software development and have been trained for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am becoming more and more convinced that this training is not right for me, so I have been studying this again and again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-inflicted (or painful) personality disorder (AVPS).
This means that I do not have any self-esteem and therefore I am ashamed.
I don't have a problem with talking to people on a more serious level, but it is very difficult for me to conduct serious talks and I have already been told that I am unreliable (although I think this is better).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a streetworker or in the open youth group, but rather in the example of search and rescue or family aid.
But I don't know if the actual working day is really that, and it's hard to find something like that on the Internet.
The AVPS has already led to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it always stops me when I want to change something in my code ("surely the most simple things") and it is difficult for me to find colleagues to ask for help ("I should now know how it goes" etc.).
The problems will probably have been mentioned in every interview but I wanted to mention them at the time.
Have you already held the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation.
I waited for a date for release
What do you want me to do with it?
If I have a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message says that your #PRS_ORG# author has not approved this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a confirmation for my shipment.
This is done by mixing the egg white (protein) with the egg yolk (amino acids) and then combining these to form the egg white protein, which he also needs for egg whites.
The formation of eggs in the nestling and the formation of eggs in the dead bird are extremely complex processes and are linked to the total organism of the bird with a particularly high prestige.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio cannot be harvested during the harvest, as it can cause disruptions in the production process.
In connection with this small dose of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

How can a brick wall fall after 9 months?
The trial in Germany is 24 months.
This is really bad service.
Hello, I have sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order has been damaged and pictures have been taken.
Have you received this email?
Announcement of a community worker for appointment
Hello r/legaladvice German,
I have a problem.
On our site, a walnut tree will be grown.
Also complaint filed with the municipality.
One employee wrote me that the fall of obstacles and thus also the wall was not part of the sentence.
In the sentence, however, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree.
Can I now leave the statement of the employee?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the sentence is clear.
Thank you for your responses
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging.
I have not received a message
Then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you please provide me with a receipt or a voucher?
What were the cheaper?
Yes, that is what I think, only the question is whether I can pay in euros and be able to send the ceiling to Germany
Can you check it?
Report: Severe traffic accident at Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the connection station Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police press alarm currently announced (14.03), a car came into the road in the opposite direction.
There are injured.
Okay, I understand.
Good, then many thanks for it being so easy!
Rat and ideas for further professional life
First of all, happy holidays to you!
My birthday is bad because my head is always thinking about what one can think.
Before I come here now... soon: I need help and the best from people who know my situation - you.
I made the ref as a referee.
I originally studied there and also worked there in a field (at least a little bit anonymously, I won't tell you anything more precise).
That was all too long and I looked at alternatives that could make me more happy.
One day I arrived at the office and was sure that it was - even if the conditions were much more flexible than in my previous job, but that was no problem for me.
I have now arrived at the third "Google other spellings".
And it's only half a year.
I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ride, then I can still compare afterwards.
But I am completely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I completely exhausted myself.
Now are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref, I always thought I would be stress resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my party.
Because I was free.
And the stress at work was equal at that time.
Now the family holiday is too much stress for me.
And then these are the structures that make me nervous.
Essentially, it makes fun and the Ref also goes well, which affects the feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and ask myself how much stress my body can handle before it completely crumbles - if he doesn't already.
I ask myself whether I want to have lived the rest of my life like this - especially when I read some of your contributions - or whether I should not have gone back to the old area, where I was valued, I could have taken my time when I needed it, and the work was done in a team that worked and not as an individual fighter like now, but for the most part of the time.
But then I ask myself if I will not return to the same place in a year and be unhappy.
You see, it's all the same to us, but maybe she has ideas or impressions like I did from this situation, which I am completely done with and almost cried at the smallest possible thought.
Decisions will be made now emotionally, which probably leads to nothing good.
But perhaps your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which will be my first.
Thanks for reading and apologize for the embarrassing silence.
I hope my situation is at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has continued to develop, leading to the combination of the progressive modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" division, with which the behavior of a throttle valve is perfectly reproduced.
With the VT20X/ VT40X/ VT100X Amps, we offer a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely at the cutting edge of technology in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is used to analyse the components and the amps, the VTX amplifiers are authenticated with absolute certainty.
These amps also contain the more common valvetronix amplifier.
This is partly based on actual analog weapons, because these are able to capture the pitch variations and nuances of a loudspeaker better than any simulation.
In addition, the VTX boosters offer a closed house and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only sound hollow.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct historical facts on the virtual stage, until the amp and the effects sound as if you have already imagined.
The perfect combination of sound and modeling technology was first demonstrated in the 2001 VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Of course, she had to be fed several times to get used to the new sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamism and numerous and carefully modelled amplifiers.
From the hand-held VT20+ to the VT120+ with two voices, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists can find a maximum sound variety here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamism of a drum machine: they expect a tight sound, a nuanced return of sound dynamism and a quick response.
While conducting an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the frequency of the sound was primarily determined by the strength of the amplifier and developed the VOX valve reactor technology on the basis of this knowledge.
The Valve Reactor Shaping of every VT+ amplifier defines the behaviour, the subtle nuances and the sound character of an amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points by Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic's NBA loss series continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough for the victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven of his older brother Moritz's, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main panel is also adjustable: with three individually adjustable light and flash compartments, it is completely tailored to the needs of your photo editing and is thus suitable for all types of cameras - from simple system cameras of all sizes to full format mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately passes in the bag depends on the size of the camera and the objective.
A possible compromise would be a DSLR camera with an attached objective, two to three zoom lenses and a burst mode.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still have room for other lenses.
In addition, you can still buy a lot of equipment.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and for taking pictures of things.
Even drone pilots also get an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest history
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the outbreak, the Lavaströme have caused great damage on the Canary Islands.
Is a end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the eruption on La Palma is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 has been described as the longest on the Atlantic coast of Africa.
There are no necessary data to be found.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has been somewhat reduced in recent days, but volcanologists did not give any prognosis on when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Inselrates, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Damage in millions of dollars
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the eruption, the more than 1000-degree hot lava destroyed almost 2900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a thin lava sheet.
This is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage was estimated at more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, there were two new landslides with a size of about 50 hectares.
The banana industry, which is crucial for the island, was particularly affected, with about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly living from it and which already found itself in crisis before the eruption.
The newspaper "El País" wrote that 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and other areas were severely affected.
Christmas and gifts
The holidays are approaching and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the holy feast.
The many gifts under the Christmas tree have been linked with the spiritual atmosphere and the solemn tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still unite our divided society.
It is more important to understand the festive tradition of the Schenkens, so that the gesture of the Schenkens, which was based on the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss's "friendly society contract of naturevolunteers", can be illuminated and the routine fulfilled in the context of this tradition again with life.
How from Nikolaus the Christkind was
The protestors had taken a strong stance, which had led to the Weihnachtstage being overshadowed by singing.
Previously, gifts were exchanged on the Nikolausday.
The backdrop for this still popular scene is that the saint, Nikolaus, as bishop of Myra, sent three women into his window at night to spare them another life in hell.
From this unconventional source of income came the popular consumption of alcohol, especially among children with gifts.
Protestants clashed over this consumption, because they considered providers between God and the people as "holy warriors."
For these reasons, they reject the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christkind from Nikolaus and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of attention shifts to the holy night.
Since most of the protesters no longer see such detail questions so much, it only strengthens the least, that the consumption of the holy Nikolaus is still a constant reminder of the Martins consumption with Martins and Martins.
Today, you can find everything you could ever want in Stiefeln in front of the Türe and under the Weihnachtsbaum of Socken, up to luxurious accommodation.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Relics are a tradition of the shrine since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of the penultimate is changed to a holy day.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a warm cheering over the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christkind am Heiligen Abend appears or the Weihnachtsmann, who in principle is a kind of Nikolaus, is invited to the party.
This includes, for example, his white shirt, which only a few members of the community still have with the more conservative Assyrian shirt of the historical figure, his glove, which is taken away by renters and the garage to access the houses.
In the Netherlands, the Holy Nikolaus remains the central figure at the Christmas party.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy the Hexe Befana are the ones who should have guided him to Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fables brought the gifts, while in Russia there were frost to the same rhythm.
Here are not rentiers, but three horses, which as a troika tied their chains.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars, the Christkind is responsible for the transfer of gifts.

Police arrest suspected bank robbers near the palace
On Saturday near Kensington Palace in London, a suspicious man was shot by the police.
The police said the caller had reported a man who had gone to a bank armed with a knife and robbed a bookstore.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was later stopped by officials.
There were shots fired and the man was hit.
He was still declared dead at the scene.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
Several bids have been made in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.

Pill problem
Hello dear woman,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year it is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again a few years ago, mainly because I had such terrible pains during the period and had PMS before the period.
Now I want to leave it alone, because I have to take enough medication for chronic diseases that I cannot take.
My main problem, unexpectedly not the pain, but my hair.
I had received my last almost two-year break from 0 to 100 explosionsartig pickel and this all over.
When so far up the mountain, but it was so beautifully loaded and I didn't feel it at all.
In the two-year pause, the whole thing has really normalized.
Maybe he has some tips for this one.
Free of perfume and without perfume is my cosmetics, but maybe there is something I can recommend.
Unfortunately, the obstetrician did not take me seriously and the pediatrician still came.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the book!
Yes, love is such a thing.
If you suffer from neurodermitis, then you have to wait for a period of time, then you have to wait for a period of time and then you have to wait for the acne issue.
I have also paid attention to my health during the time of my illness, I have tried everything possible and am still on laxatives, milk and fruit juices, because otherwise nothing has worked right.
It can also be good that hormones are just a wave, but if you want to go to all the construction sites like I do, you should stop looking for anything else.
I had already heard everything from her colleague.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and I don't know what was replied to on my behalf.

What would I have seen if there was money there?
Please check my bank data, maybe there is something wrong

110 kV cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the delivery of the new high tension cable at Tann is legally valid.
The government of Lower Saxony's decision to cancel the construction plan will free the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the Internet provider Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer long cable will connect the Tann power station in the north of the commune and the existing 110-kilovolt transmission line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to the village of Edermanning near Reut by a mast of the Freileitung.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only partially arrived at us.
The blue Betsell number: #PRS_ORG# with the sending number: #NUMBER# was sent back to #PRS_ORG# with the message "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a setup is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the next step is?
Good start in the week!

Ref: Educational plans (EK)
Hello friends and colleagues,
I have been in the Ref for the past summer, and the teaching makes me happy, but I have problems planning my teaching in the field of ecology at the moment.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped technically, so I can only use the table, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In the school I can also only copy free of charge (which makes me nervous).
I just need a bit of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently discussing the topic of geofactors and I am actually there every minute.
In principle, the methods will always be repeated, but I don't want to invest too much time for simple teaching hours (which I also need for UBs).
I actually always go from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then I explain how I can build it (usually I create a work sheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather unhappy with most of the tasks in the book.
Therefore also the working papers.
Maybe I can work as a professional translator with the book.
Make me happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided for a new one with #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to make the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is threatened by the 2G regulation at Christmas.
In most shops, only those who have paid or paid are allowed in.
The trade considers it unnecessary and complains about tax breaks.
He has also suggested a possible solution.
According to the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), the 2G rules have eroded the importance of the Christmas trade.
In stores with articles that are not for sale, profits are to be claimed, criticized HDE chief executive Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies viewed the rest of the year negatively.
Many had already written the Christmas sales.
What is actually the positive peak of the year is often a lake without a bottom, said Genth.
Manufacturers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their turnover in the past week.
It is only available in the wholesale and online sectors.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe event, said the managing director.
In the fight against the pandemic, 2G does not bring us any further, he stressed.
The current regulations are terrible for customers and require high personnel input.
He demanded that the ban be extended to the whole of Germany.
After that, each customer would only have to be controlled once on 2G (dial-up or satellite) and would have access to all stores that day with the mobile phone he had received.
In addition, in the individual trade - as already in the public transport at the 3G standard (impulsed, transmitted or tested) - stick probes should be sufficient.
The specialised real estate group Deutsche Euroshop also spoke of a difficult Christmas.
The frequencies have recently been without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre- Corona level, with payments at around 90 percent.
These figures will have fallen in the middle of the so important Christmas sales," said Wilhelm Wellner, head of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
As a result of the high personal and administrative pressure, the Center is trying to find solutions and approve them.
This includes the so-called unlocking solution, in which "visitors can get their 2G signal once again at a central location in the center and then - accompanied by a wristband similar to that in a club hotel - can disturb all businesses." dpa
I have just requested and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The paper has a cracker and on the back is also a mistake, which was tried to be cracked with a red filler.
That looks bad.
I would take the mirror back and have already packed it and packed it again.
What should I do for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, thin SMD - LEDs with higher power and higher light output.
For the adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities is used.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperature: daylight and nightlight.
It is also possible to set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K manually.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
It's a special feature of the controller, it's easy and intuitive to use.
The light creates a very bright light with a soft light of high quality, completely free of flicker.
The beam of 120 degrees, with which you can cover large areas at relatively little distance, is amazing.
In addition, also in reporting situations in small rooms or short periods.
You can adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool for both filming and working in the studio.
The optional DMX512 -controller enables the ventilation of the air in video studios or when the air is mounted at difficult access points.
At the back is the control panel, which consists of buttons and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness level in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is a slot for the NP-F battery (not included in the packaging)
Answer storage The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To transfer the settings of the individual settings to the storage plates, simply by long pressing one of the storage buttons is enough.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when the switch is turned on, so that the well-known situation is again set when the switch is turned on - very practical for studio work when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of the DL3120 is the possibility of using inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can return to existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also be checked before the set to see if the battery has enough power - it is a battery tester with built-in - for each of the two battery chargers.
In addition, it is naturally possible to provide the viewer with continuous rhythm through the transmitted network element.
The construction of the skull is very simple.
They have made a 16mm film as an introduction, so that you can see it in your photo booth.
The meeting is to be held in two sessions.
This was also taken into account by the mechanical components, which are extremely heavy, and therefore also on fatigue and hard usage.
In addition, a neigel is included in the delivery.
This is also a banknote.
So you can get the pleasure with all the equipment that you may still want to buy, without problems transporting or laying.
I'm sorry, but it is too small:(
Party we wanted to shoot": Frankfurt celebrates after Torrey comeback against Leverkusen
For a spectacular reaction by Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessen team, who had already lost twice in the series, seemed to be on the way to the next Bundesliga dispute.
But then the SGE took over, shot the frustration over a failed start to the season from the Seele within a good hour and beat them furiously with 5-2. "It's wonderful what the boys have done today," joked trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and said a "pauschal lob, to each and every one of them, that was with it."
At first, it looked like a renewed fighter for the now ranked ninth team behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led Leverkusen with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
Glasner continued, "how the players came back and showed a fantastic performance."
I am very happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, also with the result.
Defensive player Christopher Lenz, who has been on the pitch for the fourth time since the fourth game day and his overheated muscle injury, also stressed the moral of his team colleagues.
I think our mental attitude is great, said the 27-year-old and looked pleased with the result, especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to smile at today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner wants to focus on them now, and is also well prepared for the personnel situation.
It is unusual that all players have been fit in December, that all players are physically in a top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live high professionally.
Now you want to "move forward step by step and remain committed" and complete the tasks at this level by the end of the year.
As soon as next Wednesday, at the end of the English week, there will be an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky).
I got the grade and the mail came back to me because of a mistake.
I have tried to contact #PRS_ORG# and let it go, no chance.
Can it be sent to me again or must I wait until the money is returned and the order is again given?
For me then, unfortunately, it is not going to be possible to buy it because it has already been sold for a long time.
Have you ever been on the #PRS_ORG# stage?
Dampfer für Handball- Frauen vor Viertelfinale gegen Spanien
After defeating Denmark, Germany's women's handball team looked dejected with hanging heads and empty glances from the bench.
At the conclusion of the World Cup quarter-final, the DHB selection defeated the Spanish team at 16:32 (8:13) in front of an audience of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now run against Spanish hosts in the quarter-final.
We were too eager and had too much respect for the opponent, said Minister of Transport Henk Groener.
We must face Spain differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the second group with 8:2 points behind the Danish team (10:0).
It's sad that we couldn't take the flow.
This was a terrible game that we have to lose, said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the half-final, against the World Cup second of 2019 on Tuesday, a clear increase must be made in order to keep the delayed dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Another German wrestler in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was wrestler Alina Grijseels with six titles.
We were just not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," said Xenia Smits, a defensive midfielder, and demanded, "We must now look ahead quickly."
Not from top to bottom
In contrast to the previous five tournaments, the German team was not at the top.
Fouls and technical errors in the attack and in the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 defeat after seven minutes.
For example, Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at work temperature and prevented with a few stops Schlimmeres.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team at 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
However, the initial announcement was not made.
Against the aggressive covering of the Däninnen, the German women were hardly able to set themselves in scene - and when they did, they did it at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the Tor of the Scandinavians.
So it was the case at 3.10 a.m. early in the morning, for example, when midfielder Mia Zschocke saw red because of a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter finals, however, they may meet again.
Only in the closing phase of the first half came the DHB selection a bit better into the game and until the break at least on five goals.
The only hope of a comeback after the change was already at 9:19 after seven minutes.
Again, the Green Guard were silent in all areas and made it clear to the good opponent, who is counting on the medallist candidates, that it would be enough.
As a result, the German team could no longer increase its performance and went out as a clear loser from the park.
Advent calendar day 6: Family traditions at Christmas time
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have focused on the Nikolaustag and have taken it as a reason to celebrate family traditions in the lead-up to Christmas, the advent, Nikolaus, the holy night and the Christmas feast.
What was that like for you at the time?
How about your partner?
Would you like to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the best for the children?
The pillow?
Plankbacks?
Firewood?
Is music playing?
When the Christmas man comes, the Christkind or is the gift from Oma and Opa?
In the same way, as they do it, everyone gives themselves and around Christmas, it is as nice as possible to have a family.
Whether this is the now-famous tradition, or even every year what else: he tells us how it goes on in your family!
Please give me some transaction number. Or something else that could help
Confirmation... etc
I would like to get a code
The same as with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Does that happen to them?
The title gives me the impression that I am working as an emergency doctor in mobile ambulances where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is being administered.
As soon as this is done, I will go to the hospital for further treatment.
I would like to answer questions about the organisational and human aspects as well as medical questions, provided that these are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, I take it with the test.").
In my area of work, the declaration for the inspection, the indication (person has the right to be inspected under the Corona Infection Act and there is no reason), medical documentation and emergency provisions for allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The inspection itself is delegated to qualified personnel, for example medical specialists.
In Impfteams, on the other hand, we often do not have to do so, but only "only" (for God's sake, no missing valuation!) pharmacological technical assistants for the preparation of the infusion, but they cannot carry out infusions (should they?), so that I also experience the majority of infusions there.
Heavy "hiders" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "fooler"?
This dialect word, from an Amberger, has been used in the BR television program "Wir in Bayern" for strong feelings.
But unlike many other days, the concept remained unnoticed in the list "host mi?" this time from the hosts.
No, it was not a'man who is nervous'.
And no one, "has to go quickly."
This, people heard from the TV moderator, is completely wrong.
Where the man from Amberg announced the solution and thus probably also for many Oberpfalzers for the first time.
The Huidlerer, the audience is told, "is a thief, who steals from someone."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, from Bayerischer Fernsehen for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical upper-pfalzian phrase, it is somehow conveyed from the rather well-known word "Houdern".
Where a gap in education had closed - probably also in those who have lived there for a long time.
I can't buy books for two weeks.
It comes after the confirmation of the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# with the PC connected, synchronized and repaired.
There was nothing missing.
Riding selection at the race track - really so safe?
Today tomorrow I will be completely exhausted because I want to train for my road trip in the coming week at least a little.
Well, done and I went with my racing horse, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40 kilometers were also quite beautiful - but then it all went wrong, as it does in every town (again: thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splitter on the road.
Zack wanted to take the rest of the trail no matter what.
Since I had no real chance of getting a replacement mattress and a replacement blanket on the day of the party, I had to go back home and take the first best train.
Then war it also not so bad technologically, maybe even better, if I try to do it again with the steering wheel rotation.
Now I stand before a question and hope that they can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey ahead of me over several days, I would be extremely unprepared for this problem.
Now we are not really bad, because the old owners (a very old man, who arrived at the time I was leaving for the day 120 km away!) and the one who had also described this as suboptimal, because he has been involved with them for many years.
But if I think that I still have to make a change of gear at 80 to 90 kilometers, then I'm really bad lucked: D
Now I am talking to an older man at the bus stop, who asked me why I did not run the Marathon Plus, which should have been unbeatable.
Of course, the whole thing sounds very promising now.
But are these really so unbreakable?
I don't have much interest in giving away 40 euros for a ride now, only to be disappointed afterwards.
I continue to ask myself: I feel like I am currently on the racetrack at 25x622.
There is also (probably?) for the Marathon Plus, but the majority is already shorter.
Is this a problem?
Or would you like me to tell you about another ride at a roller coaster?
The Schwalbe-Seite seems to be my absolute! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks again for the help and love!

After the publication of our new High End Breitbänders B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also receive a follow-up.
SOLO 15 is the new flashlight and reminds optically of the large pictures with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a passably designed foot is directly incorporated to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can thus be adapted to the differences at home.
Principally, the SOLO 15 is very good for people who play a rather subordinate role, but the maximum sound pressure level should be reached at an unusual high level.
It is simply not possible to generate such a large sound pressure with a 10 cm microphone.
However, that does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the other hand, she is noticeably grown up and for her size is extremely impressive and accurate.
Tonal was the SOLO 15 with a light high tone.
This is a common practice among cyclists to optimize the high frequency of pedalling.
Exactly at the Hörplatz, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and weak sound.
If the area is reduced, the loudness of the sound can be increased.
Thanks to the percussion cello, the performance of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is accurate and clear.
The reference suspects the extremely minor mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM for a friend dynamism that is his own.
The SOLO 15 adds not only to our SOLO series, but also expands this in terms of output and resolution.
As is the case with all our buildings, at the beginning of the design process, thoughts are being given to the final optical design of the seafront, so that corresponding changes can be planned for the construction.
For example, if you want to furnish the houses, the reduction of the seaworthiness must be adjusted accordingly, as the furnishing adds material again.
After all the discs have been removed (for example in the fruit and vegetable market), you should first bore a 8 mm hole into the floor at the corresponding place to be able to conduct the cable there later.
With the help of an interpreter, the opening of the front is now followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be joined.
The opening with a 45-degree phase should be avoided as much as possible in order to maximize the opening area of the speaker box inside.
The four charging points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive a break in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
Then, with the actual construction of the box, one of the two side walls is placed on a flat surface in front of you.
Now the back, the deckel, the front and the floor are covered.
This should also apply to the three violations and be punished.
The thicknesses themselves can vary depending on whether you want to use finished goods from the wood market instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side will be brought.
After that, all the plates of the foot, that is, the two sides and the front, follow.
With a passable rain shower or a forest fire, the opening of the bass reflex horn, as well as the connection to the return, will be facilitated.
Afterwards, a round fryer is used to fry all the contents of the original box.
The side of the platform can also be raised.
At the end, the floor will be covered with the floor of the house and further with long wooden planks.
It follows the markings and warnings (2.5 mm drill bits) of the drilling points of the seabed and the anchor.
After the wooden structure has been dismantled (dismantled / dismantled), you start with the installation of the cab.
This is achieved simply by the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back.
By doing so, you cut the entire and complete cable strand for strand through the 8 mm Bohrung in the head to the terminal opening and lift it there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the building, the cable leads to the opening of the water spokesperson and is also locked there.
After that, the frequency will be prepared and applied.
The frequency table and the corresponding connection plan can be obtained from the following document: Montageanleitung Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency dividers are installed and the antenna terminal is cleaned, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box will be opened, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and a little bit of movement, you can pour hot chocolate on the opening and so on.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the abdication can be checked accordingly.
Now follows the arrest according to description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM will be closed and the corresponding screws tightened.
The polarization plays a significant role here, so that the transmission (marked cable) on the pluspol of the sea speaker (higher contact) must be stopped.
At the end, the bass reflex is stretched to the length of 28 mm (the total length of the rod).
For detection, a mat of the detection material is drawn in two parts and hidden in the house.
The opening of the bass reflex channel should be released.
Can I also order now and deliver at the beginning of June?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will also host the OSCAST this year!
Unfortunately, we are not able to get more than four people into the studio at a time, which means that a higher level of planning has to be done and the speed of the announcement has to be explained.
ABER: There will be at least three people per floor, so that we can follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 films in the stream and hopefully watch them all!
We take care of our best, delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - so we'll give everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will take about 30 minutes.
Have you ever been thirsty, plant a good meal and make you ready for a long, but very interesting night.
