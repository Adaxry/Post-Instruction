The goods cost under 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods...
I am #PRS_ORG# and so it is not a problem for me.
Just a number or a command to which I should reply so that it can be tracked back to you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
It costs 179 euros today.
I find this very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for a better price or is there another option for signature?
In principle, I also think that children should not be made to take on the role of an adult for their little sister.
However, I find it good to take care of the little ones in a friendly way.
Take a look, help for a short time, bring the bottle etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved.
As long as she can still be a child, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is alone for the short time and it is OK for you, that's good.
You can best determine for yourself whether this is right for your children.
It is not as if he is going to get a K2 and spend hours sleeping.
It is probably unfair.
Perhaps the psychologist's statement will come as well.
Because if something actually happens, like a fire, an earthquake, an alien invasion, etc., it would be really too much responsibility for K1 to worry about K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you;)
Help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still vividly remember the whole thing, but the title is no longer falling to me the title is everywhere I look...
The story dealt with fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a herdsman commits suicide by swallowing a spoonful of milk and jumping into a well.
The case is being taken over by a commissioner who will investigate the therapists' practices at a clinic where the patient was treated.
The commissioner has a small child who is also afraid (of fire) and in this therapist lands.
It gets more solitary and there's another character - a photographer who is tasked with going to the site of the massacre and documenting it and putting the photos up on the internet.
In the end, however, it is ultimately up to this therapist to determine what kind of underlying therapy the group provides where a chip is implanted in the patient's brain that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately makes the patients feel their anxiety in the extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window with intention to kill)
This will be referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic where a fire had broken out.
This is the broad action I am sure that the book was written in the original by a French author / author.
If this action is known to someone or even if someone can give me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
First call my man.
That can take time.
What steps must I then take?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Kind, 4 j. Splitter unter dem Daumennagel
Kind, four years, has grown over the entire length of the wooden plank under the daubernagel (in front of the entrance).
Have tried to pull him with a pin.
It's very difficult to breathe.
Was not caught and died.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
There is no chance anymore.
Tomorrow is the doctor's appointment.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of Digitaldecoder and Soundmodul on a leader plate, we can achieve thicknesses of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can thus be installed almost anywhere in the grooves for H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders will be offered with all common sizes and will always come with a 11x15mm thick “spoon-shaped” loudspeaker.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multiprotocol decoder.
He controls the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are naturally as 2- and 4-letter addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoder automatically connects to a suitable digital centre.
He controls all DCC programmed trains and, thanks to RailCom®, can read the CV values on the main gauge.
For central systems that can only program the CVs of 1 to 255 there is a help register.
Motorola® callers benefit from up to 28 steps at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola addresses enable the release of 16 functions.
An embedded program mode makes it possible to program the control unit 6021 as well.
The M4 protocol allows an automatic registration to the mfx® compatible central server.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake lines as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
The brake with DCC brake pistons or with equalization is also possible.
In addition, he is also keeping an eye on a selective transistor.
An ABC escalator automatically links two platforms.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog coaxial and composite lines.
After my certificate expires because of a claim that was not accepted with me, I will no longer be able to study for about.

Because of the omikron: Johnson wants to take a break
Politics and science in Great Britain are constantly worried about new micro cases.
This year, therefore, all eligible adults in England are to receive an intake payment.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to speed up the approval of coronavirus relief measures in the face of rapidly rising Covid-19 cases.
Every adult in England should get the opportunity to get a booster dose as soon as possible, if they have been given the second dose at least three months ago, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his people.
So far, the yield date is at the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to speed up the implementation of the abortion campaign in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the presence of the Omikron variant, a situation of emergency arises, for which the impact protection must be intensified, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased with a third dose.
′′ Let us now boo! ", Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be returned from the purchase price when returning?
I am here for everyone to use pronouns
I have applied for a job.
Today, the invitation came via email.
I want to respond to the email.
But unfortunately the name is not "Peter", but rather a somewhat more complicated name.
I have talked to him and, depending on where he / she is from, it is either a man or a woman.
**I don't know how to write an email now.
Could you please help me?
**I am a foreigner and I don't want to see any officials getting drunk.
Conclusion: everyone should use pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books.
Four of them go.
Only that one that I bought today doesn't work
Obviously, the chair had a not inconsiderable deficiency when it was sold.
How can a Polish damage after 9 months?
First on the #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working for about.
Not for 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like to add them to your order and put them in your account.
When I can't help.
Warning of content: I will write something more detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something from the heart.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One topic that really nags at me and which happens too often is that many victims do not want to help themselves or think we could not help them.
I am completely clear that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that make me feel more alive than when I can't do anything like that.
I see the blue flecks of blood, the exhausted eyes...
But even in conversation with four eyes, with the perpetrator far away from sight and hearing, I cannot all reach.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of pain, fear of leaving the living social environment, fear of the children getting hurt.
What I want to do is to make it clear to everyone that I myself am very close to tears, everyone can live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to take violence lightly.
I often wish I could help... I know I can't.
It will never become lighter.
Please always think about that, she said, it is so important without violence to live.
Arcane on Netflix: What do you think of the series "League of Legends"?
Many fantasy, many complicated names, a fascinating arrangement: "Arcane", the series from the "LEague of Legends" computer game universe, has just been launched on Netflix.
Why are we happy about the already announced two series?
Baseball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick.
Again nothing: The Riesen in Crailsheim lost again - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with a view to the cup defeat at the beginning of October at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have a bit of anger in the belly."
However, after the game, she did not put on the trophy - she did it again in front of the 61:72 (28: 38) - defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereas the result in itself was more important than the way it was achieved.
The substitute is a statistic mentioned to express the entire dilemma. The triple-quote refers to just 13 percent, four goals (all by the young Johannes Patrick) and 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer came from John Patrick: "We were not focused enough after the victory in Teneriffa and did not implement what we trained for."
So the ball was moved.
Gladly, his counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted: "To win a clever game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
It feels like it took place in front of 10,000 people.
On Saturday only 750 spectators were allowed into the Hohenlohe Arena, but they were charged for it.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and his team's lead.
The best player I have trained, Gleim praised.
While in the Patriots' own ranks, such performers as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) struggled.
Just in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came even closer to eight points after they had already lost 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Much time remains for happiness.
Already on Wednesday (7 p.m.), the giants will receive the skyliners in Frankfurt, before also receiving a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We had a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already reported it a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all performance claims were rejected.
We have once again been legally informed and have therefore written them again.
We had already announced it a half year ago.
Always like from the EI: Max Raabe will be 59
He wants to seduce his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently he is on his way with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he can then.
Max Raabe originally wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig that Sunday.
But that won't change anything.
The planned concert was postponed to May 2022 - "with careful consideration" in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Other of his planned appearances during Advent must also come to an end, as is stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musician (www.palast-orchestra.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to take their term 2020, which had already been postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic, back.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe had a lot of fun as a child.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded together with comrades the Palast Orchester.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the comedian harmonists.
He was often marked with prices.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place on the charts exactly like his success album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013).
He has made it into the mainstream.
Always elegant, the blonde hair tightly wound and on the mind’s eye, Max Raabe is no longer to be forgotten.
He has been on tour with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" since 2020. dpa

Federal building inspector Klara Geywitz: No new homes through approval
The new Federal Minister for Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out in favour of large housing corporations, as was demanded in Berlin in a referendum.
Geywitz said in an interview with the ‘Tagesspiegel’ (Sunday): “With an agreement, there is no single new apartment, but the ownership structure is changed.”
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
An improved mix of private landowners, cooperatives or housing companies is usually the best protection against a monopoly image.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up an expert commission to follow up on the result of the people's vote.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz is not ruling out further tightening of the law with the FDP in the Ampel coalition.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent control brake until 2029, a limit on the height of tenants in crowded residential areas, and the expansion of the rental registry.
I will talk to the Justice Minister to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not respond in this way, "we will talk to our coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 deaths from tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been caused by the US.
Almost 100 people could be killed in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there remind me of a war zone.
On Saturday night in the United States, several tornadoes caused severe damage and may have killed up to a hundred people.
The storm leaves behind a roughly 320-kilometer-long tail of destruction, particularly in the state of Kentucky.
His governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere where the tornado had ripped through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just out.
Some industrial plants, chimneys are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible at all.
He alone is believed to have killed up to a hundred people in the state of Kentucky, official figures are steadily climbing.
Hello, I just saw that they are selling the Vitrine #NAME#.
That is very sad.

I understand that I can only order the ceiling now and leave for Germany?
I had sent back an article on the contact form and received a refund, and wanted to check whether it had been received or was being processed, as I had not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay damages and change advertising claims
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for an emergency grant, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and offered their employees for the inspection of money prizes.
In doing so, they are on a level with social partners such as the ÖGB and the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for inspection.
The design of advertising slogans to call for donations - according to the German example - should also increase the readiness for Corona donations.
He was transferred to a different company.
That makes his situation not better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He has certainly not kept up with his old position and has looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: not at all.
He didn't find his job either.
There are too many variables.
Do not give them the stoning.
That will then be relevant legally.

Help with first campaign
Boron to the rescue!
I am taking a break just for a group of four friends and want to lead them on an adventure over the Greifenpass and take them on a campaign of their own writing specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bulk is done, the boobs and their motives are written, the individual acts have been collected and now I am here to write the playbill and rip it up at the first encounter about my own fleshes.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a wheel of grain from the fields to a small village near the Thuran river.
There should be further action there.
Some miles from the village, a group of goons is to ambush and lynch the heroes.
I want to give the players the opportunity to get to grips with different forms of confrontation: believers, fools, madmen, those who recognise the danger early on, whatever that may do to the players.
Group size: Eight common goblin, two with spears, six with clubs and swords
As soon as they are not noticed, the goblins run to the heroes in a halo and flank them on the left and right, holding torches in their hands while two with spears stop the wheel.
If the fight comes and the heroes fall, I have two solutions
The heroes are found all of a sudden by the son of the schoolmaster, a half-brother, and are fed and cared for.
The car is naturally away.
If a defeat is inevitable, this half-crown with two of its keys drags the devil out of the battle to help.
The Karren is still there, everything is super.
How does her Deus ex Machina of Solution 2 work?
Is the encounter as a first step into adventure too much?
The Goblin group will play an important role later on, so it's not just cannons.
Edited: wow, I hadn't thought of that with so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee many of your ideas and now I have even more confidence in my narrative.
I put the lamp back together again.
And again together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
I would still like to send them back
Then you can take the pillow away, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I am a fan of Sky Sport F1
Hello fans of F1, the quality on the German sky has increased over the course of the season, so I want to take a breath with this post.
First of all, the transfer was cancelled today in the middle of the F2-Race in order to start the F1-reporting in time.
It was far from planned by the delay in the start and the start accident, but one could still show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it is for legal reasons that the F 1 privilege is enjoyed and for this reason everything else must be limited, so that Sky DE did not have a choice.
Despite that, Sky UK aired the race.
Despite that, a little praise: The commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was a rule-breaking incident in F1 with commentator Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of whom did not know that it was possible to change lanes under a red flag.
Although this situation has already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that Verstappen can change the fenders if there are corresponding exhaust fumes to this topic on Hamilton.
Both Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this is what Verstappen has got.
I think such basic rules should be known when commenting on F1 on a pay TV channel.
It is not even the first time this has happened, which now according to rules may or may not be possible, both have absolute uncertainties in the topic of rules.
Generally, Roos's commentary style does not appeal to me, but it's the substance that counts.
But I really like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
These include permanent establishments that just look amateurish, such as the order of coffee at (almost unnoticed) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" of Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the last one brings a lot of unrest into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least because the advertising is simply ridiculous on Sky, with Sky being the only channel to feature in the adverts, which can be seen on F1TV after the race, only in German.
Neither Servus TV nor ORF did that.
These two broadcasters also do less advertising on the training than Sky, and as a free-to-air broadcaster.
It is true that one needs gloves and ladder for their work, but that does not make me see the details along the way.
The entire program of Sky Sport F1 is also very strong and full of replay.
In total, Sky is really the worst German language broadcaster that adds F1.
Unfairly, RTL makes a better job of advertising the four races that they still have a chance of winning.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes a lot less fun than it would with a decent transmitter.
I would like to hear your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# Pendles, Messing and more expensive glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should have been delivered last week and is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady said it would be sent on Monday, and the Second Lady said she had sent an email and it had never been answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on December 12.
One of them has already shown a defect after relatively short time (the material has a hole in the front part of the skull).
I request support.
Larger pumps are available to supply an aquarium with additional water.
It is also possible to control the filter system via the air conditioner.
This series is offered in 3 variants.
See the table at the end of the offer.
You can see the performance there.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run all the equipment.
If you own a large aquarium, you can use pumps with 2 or more outlets so that you can connect several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four appearances, depending on the model. However, the Lüfterpumpe also offers the possibility to set an accent in the aquarium with a fan (you will find it in our shop), or with a decor, which changes the light rays in a function.
Here would be a deposit, a rock or something similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-absorbing construction and is designed to reduce noise pollution.
The installation is very easy.
The Lüfterpumpe is connected to an air valve 4/6 mm in diameter...and it can even leak.
The Lüfterpumpe should be the same, or higher than the water level and carried out outside.
According to the theory, you should put in place a return vent if the cooler is placed closer to the heat source.
The air flow is simply divided and the ventilation is adjusted in between.
This would prevent water from running back into the creek if there was a leak in the pipes...
If the wind turbine is to be installed in the open, like other wind turbines, it should be covered and protected from the elements
The pump of the MK series is a pure power package that consumes little energy
Even if we indicate the working time of 3 days here on eBay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are also collected daily here.
Everything is going well, it is very fast.
We just want to prevail once and for all, so that nobody is disappointed just because it took longer than expected.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for the entire staff, who also work in the expeditions...of course here doesn't stop Corona.
Please do not rate it as bad just because the delivery is delayed, that is all.
Of course you are happy about these services, even if we are saying...they are having a hard time
This is also very different regionally.
You are not alone, you are healthy, and we all hope that things will get better again.
How long does it take to order the yellow and the blue?
Can you also get the balls in hell?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronauts daughter and moderator into the world
The son of the first US-American in history, a TV host and four other passengers are on a short trip around the world.
They were transported on Saturday from the "Amazon New Shepard" rocket system owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos took a personal snap of the newly-capped astronauts as they returned to Earth.
Welcome back, said Bezos in a blue suit, as he opened the Luke to the box.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually emerged and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were traveling for ten minutes and thirteen seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who was flown into space by Blue Origin rocket system, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were regular customers of the company, which had other four passengers paid for their tickets: Space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and her son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how many they each paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled the short flight to her father's mission.
He had worked hard at his tasks and had to do everything himself.
She just got carried away, said the 74-year-old with a smile.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to return to the All as soon as possible, said the moderator.
New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometers
The "raketensystem" "New Shepard" is largely automated.
The capsule, which separated from the satellite during the flight, reached a height of around 100 kilometres above the Earth, at times with great looseness, before the reusable object plummeted from great heights to land.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers over the Earth as a limit to the world, but there is no binding international agreement on this.
It was already the third time Blue Origin had made an all-out trip: In July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
On October 2, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was there, known for his role as “Captain Kirk” in “Star Trek,” as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin’s deputy CEO, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pursuing the business of global tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry
I am currently studying Biochemistry in the first semester and find the profession actually quite exciting and also in the laboratory I am not afraid to stand up (I have already had an organic chemistry practice behind me).
Of course, I had also already informed myself about professional obligations at that time, but at the time I also thought that I wanted to study for promotion and would.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially about my professional prospects.
On one side (Studycheck etc) you always hear super impressive applications and the application is totally sought after, on the other side you always hear about unemployed biologists and unbelievably poor positions.
Therefore, I'd be interested in:
(1) What is your current work?
(2) Are you satisfied with your work/employment?
(3) What did your study/What did your training?
Answer:Do you still want to do that?
Many thanks for your responses!
I am currently uncertain and may drop out of university in 2022 and do an apprenticeship in information technology.
If she has experiences, she writes them too:)
Extra stress before holidays and weekend days
This topic came up last week for me.
However, I had to use my long weekend to get over it.
That's why it's only now coming to a head.
Not only during large holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
As it seems there are also more brunch days before the feast day.
It was like this: Last week, Mariä Himmelfahrt, which in Switzerland is called "Auffahrt".
On Friday, most people and businesses take part in a day of rest, which is semi-official.
There was a long four-day weekend in the house last week.
What happened last week?
Overall stress.
Lauter E-mails, which were still waiting to be delivered, task here task there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... why?
Because "then next week" it seems so long and it can't be?
Or because people want to give all their energy in a compressed week as much as in a normal week?
I wasn't just stressed out on Wednesday, I was exhausted.
What should this self-talk about holidays be?
What do we have then for our anniversary if we can't have sex?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent.
My question is simple: Are we just like you, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed evangelical art?
Or does she know this in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld celebrates Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is happy to celebrate Christmas in her thuringian home - but has not even made a wish.
The beauty, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get ready for the festival by getting dressed up with her son and dancing.
I love that," said Catterfeld.
But until then, she still had a lot to do: "First of all, I didn't have any gifts, now I finally have to open them."
NEKTON-Bio supports the healing of wounds without the need for sutures.
NEKTON-Bio contains all the vitamins, amino acids, minerals and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio provides the bird with a glossy and shiny feeder.
The majority of the injuries sustained in the event are solely due to nutritional errors.
Since the feeder consists of a non-toxic substance, the formation of a free-flowing pellet is a particularly rich and beneficial annual feeding for the bird.
For a functional exchange of nutrients, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
The majority of animal losses that occur during the breeding season are caused by poor feed quality or insufficient vitamin and mineral supply.
In the synthesis of NEKTON-Bio, the unhealthy relationship of the amino acids in most plant-based dairy products is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
While the use of NEKTON-Bio should not be supplemented with any other vitamin preparation.
NEKTON-Bio is completely biodegradable and can be discarded with the regular wastewater or composted.
Thank you, I found it
It still doesn't work
DDR locomotive model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the loco was in operation in Schlesien and Middle Germany, and the loco is probably the rarest of its kind, originating from the depot scheme of the locomotive builder ME Heft 11/1968, used with spur tracks and defects photos, function well, The E 95 is a heavy goods train locomotive of the German Railways (DRG) for the freight service, which has been equipped with spur tracks and defects, possibly also from the small series firm ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are able to operate it
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn Company commissioned AEG to develop proposals for an electric locomotive that could operate on this line at a speed of 2,200 tonnes of coal and 530 tonnes of passengers per hour.
As a maximum speed, 65 km/h was requested.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined that the delivery was the 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with depot-driven AEG engine, with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which bore the number E 95 01-06.
All were involved in the Second World War and found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were repaired in the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the project to improve the country's rail network in Dessau, all six locomotives were tested for their operability.
[4] When the middle-Dutch network required an increasing number of locomotives for the heavy goods train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were renovated in 1959, with the other machines serving as spare parts.
First the E 04, E 44 and E 94 in large quantities were removed.
Only when turning left on the E 94 did it become apparent that the workforce could not be increased any further, and the E 95 returned to the focus of attention.
First, the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They came to Halle P. in 1960 for the construction of the railway
They were mostly used in a circular route around Kohlenzügen in the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated tax system for the locomotives is becoming increasingly problematic with increasing age.
This meant that Schütze often had to wait for Schalthandlungen.
Then the man on this locomotive who was constantly on the move had to remove the seat cushions during the journey with a hammer and plank of wood.
The damage to the locomotive's engine was more extensive and led to months of outages.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and there was not planned for a clear expansion of the electric services at that time, the Reichsbahn could rely on old locomotives and most of the splitter agreements, so that the E 95 was used outside of service.
In addition, according to them, Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to use electric locomotives only for men, which would have caused problems in the operation of the locomotives and the signals from the main control.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were dismantled in the middle of 1969, they followed the E 95 01, which left the service on October 5, 1970.
The new registered number 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives were stopped on the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was moved to the Halle railway station as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a souvenir.
It took some time before those responsible at the railway were convinced that the E 95 was as valuable as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first refurbishment of the locomotive began, with the goal of presenting it to the public in Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Dresden traffic museum as a non-operating museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
The locomotive is being displayed in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have worked on the maintenance of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and more refined lack of equipment, with the transformators checked and five locomotive engines capable of operation.
The locomotives were on the Schlesische Gebirgsbahn until 1945, when they were withdrawn to the reserves, where they awaited their restoration and eventual retirement.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the German net.
The main focus was initially Schlesien
Work model H0 in OVP, function good, it is necessary to have optical maintenance on the site in own work, engraved, with play marks, Kellergumpe!!!, very rarely a work model, very small range - probably the turnover also comes from the subsidiary company ZSCHUTSCHKE und BACHMANN
The packages can display labels and wrappers.
Yes, the F-parts are it
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle part is held in two folds. Unfortunately, these are too small and the folds cannot be mounted on the folds.
What do we do now?
I cannot build the bed.
The middle part is held by two fingers, which are unfortunately inaccurate.
The middle part does not fit into the intended halter.
I also get new emails.
When will they be lost?
Not a flake.
That is, according to the montage director, the right of the form, they were just too short
But that is equal.
The main purpose is to fulfill their purpose
For me they are not flat
Could I get this?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two injured and serious damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in an apartment building in Oberbayern.
On Sunday, the police announced that an estimated damage of six billion euros had occurred in the euro area.
The fire had spread from a carport to the adjoining terraced house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with minor burns on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not believe in a premeditated fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it comes much later
And I have to pay again for shipping costs
To prove fake news - Biontech CEO publishes impact photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first treatment on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021
Until now, Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin has not publicly commented on his health status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo of his Corona test.
The illness of a friend has moved him to this, Sahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainz-based Biontech company, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving an injection against the coronavirus.
Social media had false information that I had not been vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received three professors from the Biontech-Pfizer medical school," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on LinkedIn.
′′ For several months friends have been asking me to take a photo of me in which I am smiling in order to destabilize this false rumor ".
So far, he has rejected this, because the communication did not focus on him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply shaken when I realized that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 infection and is on a ventilator for three weeks.
The student and his family were not injured, Sahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
However, the most common cause seems to be fear, often caused by inaccurate information and misunderstandings."
Fears only get worse with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not injured.
However, the video was released in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself stated.
At the time, Şahin said: "It is not allowed by law for me to receive the transfusion."
There is a prioritisation in Germany for the evacuation of the tank.
For the time being, the prioritisation has long been lifted - and the chief executive of the biotech industry has reportedly agreed to do so three times.
Fire in Umspannanlage: Ten thousand people without power
In many municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday: no more electricity and in many cases also no heating.
There was a fire station nearby.
After a fire with serious damage to a power station in the Rhine-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia, tens of thousands of people had to leave their homes for around 24 hours without light.
On the evening of the fire, at 41,000 affected residents and residents in several communities, the sounds of crying came out.
The Westnetz transmitter reported that numerous telephone lines in Betrieb had been disrupted on Saturday until the large-scale disturbance was finally removed late in the evening.
Firefighters and volunteers from the THW provided assistance in the communities.
Authorities put emergency seats in schools and called for help from neighbors.
The donor thanked those affected for their patience and those helping for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have been significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected communities, the district, the fire department and the THW for their extraordinary commitment," said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take several days, as the WestNetz mountain cranes will first only be able to put some of the lines back into service provisionally.
According to technical information, a technical defect led to the fire.
Light is flowing again
According to information from Westnetz, the fire which broke out on Friday at around 19.15 was so strong that parts of the 10,000-volt power plant in Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were severely damaged.
There are necessary reconstruction and repair works there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt power line was made.
With the help of this bypass, the electricity supply is once again restored.
Since Saturday at 18:00, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power back on.
Further 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were blocked from the town centre at 21.30.
Since 23:15, the last people affected by the accident had also lost power.
More than 80 Westnetz and partner companies were in operation.
The authorities had also called for help from neighbours after the construction of a noticeboard for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
It is now important that citizens and their neighbors care for older or lonely people in their communities and share their contact details with the local fire department if help is needed, said district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The residents of Altenheimen were particularly targeted when it came to setting up and running the Notstrom aggregates.
In addition, according to the authorities, emergency accommodation in schools has been set up for people who cannot afford to pay for their own accommodation or those who require specialist medical equipment in connection with medical treatment.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold.
Can I buy and pay in euros?
It is the daydress #PRS_ORG# in blue and grey.
I hope you have a nice day and stay healthy ♡
I can't put it on the table though.
It is a custom #NAME#.
There are 3 executions.
We wanted everyone with a tabletop diameter of #NUMBER#
We have 155 cm of width.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't put it together and thus reduce it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise I would have to send them back as they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy about a return
That's really easy!
Then we'll do it!
Can you send me the backside by mail?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG# before the purchase.
Should I do that now?
I find a signature so low almost unbelievable.
We are not agreed
Northern combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to victory at the world cup in the Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to give up again, this time to the remarkable Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already taken a big lead after the ski jump into the loop.
Return of the number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both made changes and use the version 4.5...
It can be assumed that they have already encountered problems
I have just bought a bottle of my #PRS_ORG#, which seems to be in demand too.
As soon as I open the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
The file may be reported to the customer service.
It is an #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Could you please repeat that?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work on it too!
To ensure that the shade is evenly distributed and clean, you should clean the shade parts with some disinfectant soap, rinse them with clear water, and pat them dry.
Before you put the pin on the first time with a new color, it is recommended to have 2 to 3 strokes.
You can't do this anymore on the later visible part of the toolbar or on a jogging cup.

Turn the thread evenly around the needle.
Lighter color overlaps later on for a more even surface.
Move quickly with the pin.
This creates unrealistic areas.
Model is not a garden gnome.
Begin with the bloody colors.
The dark could later turn out to be true.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come to a close with a separate pin.
Otherwise, if they mix with normal colors, they can get ugly metals.
Let the frozen parts rest for a day before you thaw them out.
The models achieve a unique appearance by the decals or background images.
From safety symbols on aircraft to ship names and signs on automobile models: The decals give the model the final touch.
Bring the decals in the right order, while the parts are still good to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be made lighter before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tool like knife, pincers and saw is time, patience and a calm hand.
Take any needed decals and stick them to you.
Decorative stickers are also called "wasserschiebepictures" because you can see their reverse side with water until the adhesive paper turns dark through the nostrils.
Then you just snap the picture of the paper a little bit and put the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you also highlighted beforehand).
While you are holding the decal on the model with a tool, you are also pulling away the transparency paper.
Attention: Always check that the image is correct before you drop it from the paper, so it doesn't grow on your finger, knit or even tear.
Waste water with a household bill.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time, when I look at something else I don't want to read the book anymore and have to leave and sign and load the book again and look up where I've read it.
On Saturday, I had already communicated with you.
Can I get this by email?
For all three packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 individual packages to me
Still, thank you a lot!
Then I'll buy somewhere else when the money is back.
Do I get the problem solved?
Child protection in PKV / What is a "protection case"?
Hello together
We had been working with children for a while in play therapy, but now that it is about prevention with the PKV, this suddenly feels strange.
The series continues:
We had applied for the children's ward treatment in advance at the PKV and received the use allowance over 3 attempts.
The attempts were limited in various ways (e.g. by age, success, etc.)
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was accounted for by the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and carried out two unsuccessful attempts, but we did not expect this with the PKV.
We again applied for the costs to be reimbursed at the PKV and were granted 3 further attempts.
After a few further attempts (we have carried out more attempts than stated, logistically the most expensive with the PKV) we arrive at the bill at the PKV and receive the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2 + 3) the PKV wants only 3 attempts made.
The explanation: With the pregnancy/childbirth, the other two attempts of the first use failed.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to AGB, "the insurance risk begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts here are as follows:
* Who has the right to do the PKV (only 3 attempts are allowed) or us (it is 5 attempts to estimate)?
* Did the PKV have to point out to us that with a birth the other attempts fail?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance risk?
The infertility (due to blocked ovaries) is not passed on to the first child.
It would be super if the experts could give their opinion here.
Many thanks for your help!
Could you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can reach them best?
Okay.
We will no longer order anything from them.
If they add up the payments from me and my boyfriend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
This is what they can tell their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the refund had been requested and now you tell me that I only have to send you the thing.
I can certainly do nothing about that
Please see what the class wrote in the screenshot
It is clear and obvious that the refund was requested and that I have not yet received a refund per #PRS_ORG#
She can change her manager's mind that she has lost two regulars.
My boyfriend has also ordered various furniture for our living room.
That will no longer be done.
No, the defect only emerged after a few months.
An office chair needs normal use.
Otherwise they cannot sell him as a building material.
Unconditionally, the duration of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to have another type of packaging.
I will cut off the line and make it available to the telephone company.
Good morning, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are marked with additional price tags, but unfortunately we cannot find them for you.
Can they help?
Top of the week: The best low budget films
What is a low budget film exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little or no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the internet, you can find a wealth of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What are you getting at?
And what do you think about that at all?
He is a very good customer of Euch, he has already set up two homes completely with Eureka furniture.
To enquire about the best price for the luxury leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended once again, is this now safe?
Many thanks
With kind regards
If there is no telephone number, a chat where one has to wait for 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the Warteposition...I will then get back to it again soon because it simply doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half a victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can claim a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus," said Bossong to the Evangelical Pressedienst (epd).
The EU did not resolve the confrontation, the researcher of the Berlin-based Science and Politics Foundation (SWP) explained.
This shutdown - Belarus doesn't give a damn about it, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably go on for a while.
The approach to the people on the border is not in line with the European human rights convention, Bossong said.
It seems that there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole does not intend to resolve the dispute, this will have costs for the fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakens the cohesion in the Union.
She apparently cannot be persuaded to do what a member state wants to do when a member state puts its head in the sand, to make its own decisions, as currently Poland, which does not allow access to its borders by the EU border protection agency Frontex.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policies at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A fundamental agreement on asylum policy has been agreed, as the line "boundary protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
New attempt to cross the border
According to the Polish border guards, migrants are again trying to reach the Polish territory via Belarus.
On Sunday night, 55 migrants were arrested and brought back to the border, said a spokeswoman for the authorities.
The Polish officials were beaten by the migrants with sticks during the incident.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, 52 border guards attempted to cross the border within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border.
In recent months, thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU, or are trying to do so.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko of being the mastermind in Minsk, with the intention of entering the EU.
According to press reports from Poland and Lithuania, border crossings have been closed.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened air companies that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU officials are arriving in refugee camps in the countries of origin to enforce closure.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
The EU has used its market power to put pressure on the countries involved and demonstrated their unwillingness to act with extraterritorial sanctions.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs must also take into account political costs.
The Belarusian society is not convinced that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial F1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen caused two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial F1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes have made an appearance.
The silver medals hold up to two rules violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
The protest is based on Max Verstappen's alleged overtake in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he was supposed to have passed correctly.
Another appeal was made against the value at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not complied with.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the last race of the season and was ready for his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the driver from Germany had overtaken the car in front of him.
I check that.
I'm talking to the bank and calling again to you
Thanks for the support
Free entry for members: Europa Park hosts SC Freiburg on Friday
The Europa Park, named after the Europa Park stadium of the sports club Freiburg, has been commissioned by the SC Freiburg.
As the park announced, members and card holders of the sports club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community are free to visit the European Park on this day.
In addition, there was cheese for drinks and sausages.
The front doors smelled of rotten eggs and sewage that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park in Rust, located 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg game in the Europa Park last Friday, it once again showed how well the partnership works.
Struggling fans can be seen, who together have fun in the rear, which confirms it, says Jürgen Mack, Europe Park owner.

Judith Hermann from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann on Friday presented her latest novel "Daheim" at the sold-out Blue Note and also served as a moderator.
She is dead, lives in a house on the coast and listens to the night sounds on her bedroom door.
I gave the contact form a go yesterday but didn't get an email confirmation or anything like that.
My question would be whether my request has been accepted.
Not everyone has the time for your interrupted chat and wrongly delivered goods from China.
Your error, not all from our budget.
Contact the woman #NAME#.

However, these statements only apply for exact conditions that are rare in use.
In order to use your lipstick optimally, we ask you to pay attention to the information in the table "Technical Data" (see Use Guide in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - also on impact - there are light reflections.
Through an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When adjusting the optimal use conditions - Lupe is tight in front of the eye - mirror reflections on the lens areas are less noticeable.
You can find further information in the accompanying use permit (in German and English).

Tannery sale in Schönwolde: Women in the community are collecting the Christmas trees
Local farmer Frank Diers has already experienced strange situations when selling fruit.
Once a man is even without his partner, because they cannot agree.
Every year he grows about 2000 plants.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some strange situations.
This makes the eve of the festival always a little more exciting, he says.
And with the voucher??
Otherwise I'm out as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now I have to pay the full price for it.
Then I'll rate that accordingly!
We do not need discussions about the best court here, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have their names.
In German, for example, it would sound like "dreher," which doesn't sound so cheerful at all.
Problems with glass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass entrance in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wi-Fi network.
I had a DSL connection of 50 Mbit before and used Devolo's DLan, which up to a couple of failures was able to send and receive 50 Mbit free of charge.
The new fibre optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and on the DLan Modul, which is connected to the FritzBox, this also comes in.
However, the other DLan module, which is responsible for the WiFi, is no longer the full 500, but I move closer to the house with the module, so less comes in (I use a stack dose that goes from 1 to 3, etc. The other module is removed).
This means that the Internet is now even slower than before (~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which seems to use a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also huge losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost when using a fibre optic cable?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely inconvenient to have to lay cable in the house LAN.
I'm really impressed by the fact that I've set up an extra account here.
Therefore, I would be more than happy with an answer.
When is the time to change your checking account
Whoever thought that now would be the time to calm things down at the Giro accounts is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to refloat their accounts with all manner of tricks to show their customers that interest rates have been cut, deposit rates continue to fall further.
For example, Deutsche Bank would be able to lend with a limit of €100,000 for a relatively long time.
Now she has halved the gratuity and even refunded the day's wages.
In a first step, the limit was only set for customers of the Konzern-Sparte Postbank - at 50,000 euros for Giro and Advance accounts and at 25,000 euros for daily account accounts.
However, these lower fees apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed in response to a query.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "renewed individual agreements with customers."
The Commerzbank had already gone bankrupt on a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as with ING Germany.
Direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced its bond yields in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
In the end: More than 100 banks have now paid a compensation of €25,000 or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda Bank in Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which have first instance rights against this ruling even in Berlin.
Nowadays, discussions are already taking place in banks about whether the institutes should form reserves - for the case that also the upper institutes have to declare negative interest rates and have to refund millions to customers.
The table for 8 people was delivered instead of the table for 6 people.
This is enough for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is like climbing a mountain and trekking.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman in Hollywood by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, who made 2021 a year of "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show," this success is in the first place the result of a lot of discipline and work.
To look their best, an entire army of assistants, stylists and trainers are on hand.
In the end, as Aniston says, you can have a chip on a day (yes, really: a single chip from the bag).
It is really a wonder that she still flies the hearts of both female and male fans.
Maybe it's because she just had a baby with the luck - and still wants to find that big love.
And the Babywunsch der Liste gestrichen hat.
She had been constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
People who asked me that have no clue what with me personally is medically impossible.
It was really cold.
Keep hoping that success and glory will come.
Unworthy of a career end: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's retirement from Formula 1 was still leaner than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42 year old Finn took off the glove and noticed the blood of the hand.
That was it.
After a tire error and a minor band damage, Räikkönen had to withdraw his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix not half an hour after starting.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the ‘Iceman’ ending his career in the motorsport class.
At his farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children were also travelling to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's biggest success was the 2007 World Championship victory in Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix titles, started 18 times at the pole position and came in 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich takes 60th World Cup victory - Nolt siegt im Zweierbob - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobber.
I have that figured out, I need to win one more race per season to be able to do it until Cortina in 2026, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who registered two wins in two days at the Winterberg races.
On Saturday, he first defended the attack of Johannes Lochner by jumping five hundred steps from third to first.
Then he changed something about the material setting and got a big lead back on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team, Thorsten Margis (SV Halle) and Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he defeated the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We are taking greater risks today and have been rewarded, said Friedrich, who also scored his 22nd goal in the series.
The Stuttgart-bound Berchtesgaden native Johannes Lochner came in second place this time, one place ahead of him.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach came fourth in the first race at place eight.
If I knew what he was going to do, I would do it too, said Lochner.
None with home victory - podium for Japan
On her heel, Laura Nolte scored the third win of the season for the ladies.
After only winning the fourth place in the Monobob on the previous day for the fourth place, she raced to the world championships on Sunday with coach Deborah Levi to the world championships.
Two-time Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, to second place.
She booked the first place in this Winter's first Podest.
The Wiesbaden player Kim Kalicki came in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
It was supercool for me to be the first priest in the world cup, I am superhappy that Mariama is taking me on.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but today's start times were okay," said Burghardt and emphasised: "It is not only jumps, but there is also a lot to do with drums."
Jamanka shrugged off the not entirely flawless driving, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the ceiling already in the warehouse and now I could buy it!!!
What should I do?
I didn't even get to him and therefore couldn't release him, so I finally asked.
Last year I had completely different problems and never had time for that.
And now it was revealed what had really upset me.
See the chat about the Asare Sitzbank.
I want to give it back and then order again, because it's just discounted:)
Why is the delivery only on 16 March?
There was nothing of that length on your website
No, not until I get a tip that there is an extra field with the message
Yesterday it was announced by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today
I've also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the royal module, just a new unblemished
And not cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello beautiful girls and boys,
I have some things I just want to write down and maybe it is the one - or the other...
I am 24 years old, have a part-time job, a dog and a mother - it is actually quite a coincidence that my dog barks or goes to the kindergarten, my child is actually 1 to 1.
My boyfriend (we have been together for 6 years) is sick, he has a brain hemorrhage and is depressed (but now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also had emotional needs and because I wanted to see and feel him, we had a lot of fun and it was nice.
I have hugged him at the funeral (because hand is in the association for cremation).
He is cold in the back and we are seeing less (1 - 2 x week) what makes me with my needs for affection and love very difficult.
My dog just barked, I fed him and now he's in his casket and he's relaxed a little bit after I fed the worms and gave them to him.
I live alone with my sister and mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we are getting even more housework, which of course we share.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just fine, I am halfway through therapy and coming back.
Not good, but I'm coming off it and I'm almost symptom-free.
My uni is asking for a lot (for me), I have a written test tomorrow between the hours of 15 and 17, and tomorrow afternoon I have an anatomy class for which I should at least be prepared.
And next week, on Tuesday, I have a monthly examination, and what comes up is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more place.
So my week is: Only until tomorrow is weekend.
But then what happens?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it remains forever.
I think I'm just stressed out so much that I need these mental breaks because otherwise I can't handle it.
In any case, I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do that...
Does it also work for you?
Ehrlich, I am incredibly grateful that I do not have to work.
In fact, I cannot thank you enough.
I don't know if I would have survived otherwise.
I believe this has partly to do with mental load from women and that's why I thought I was going to find love here...
I wish you a pleasant evening, the week is almost over!
Today I received my order, unfortunately the whole other color plus the top surface is scratched and the table leg has ink stains.
The first delivery was exactly as described on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we sit at the table now, will I get another colour or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on December 26th.#NUMBER#.
In the other two.
She was not confirmed.
Everything was completely different: at the time I was taught in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and that they only teach another subject like math or earth science.
For me, this was always a little strange, maybe also because I had been baptized as a Christian and I had always thought that way.
How do you get there?
Maybe you can also tell your colleagues at work or at school with different accents.
In principle I understand the difference between private and professional and it is intuitive to separate them.
There is also a learning plan.
But is it just as easy to have a physicist who doesn't believe in relativity?
What then brings one to believe in religion when one does not believe in it?
What is culture?
The question is not private.
Can't it be changed or not? Please write in English
That is very long ago, then I would see it
It's good, thank you.
I expect a reply by the earliest possible date, at the latest by next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Help me find films
Hello love people
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was made for young people.
There are two times in the film.
On the one hand, the modern world (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite sure).
There is a young woman because I cannot describe it in the real world.
And in the land of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Fluch of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the state of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this state to live herself.
The transition is also the grave of the soldier.
At the end, both soldiers are fighting each other.
If you say that, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one has only slept on the couch for a week.
Fast forward: still alive: D
Enjoy yourself.
So a child holds much more than you think.
Worrying that everything is going wrong, taking no risks, but no minutes of observation.
That makes you very happy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good matratze.
No bed.
Achso and we had no pillow, but always a blanket.
Some may see your child if it smiles.
Does it hurt the head?
Is it possible to get rid of smoke?
Or is it going to sit directly in the mat?
You can check to see if everything is OK.
We have all grown up, and when my husband went to the world, it was a gang and a binge that you put the kids on the couch to sleep.
In addition, we are already familiar with you and have already bought a lot of articles
But why only offer me 20 euros?
Hello, I wrote to you yesterday and so far no reply.
It is about my washing machine, which was delivered by the previous owner (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right-wing conspiracy does not fit into the pattern.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The current crisis is not suitable for use.
To make it quite clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, nothing can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
If it is just that the politics of this channel are now dead in the water, it is simply a matter of time.
Fast every format is sponsored (ok), but then at the same time you still go on big bike tours.
It was said that you were an " Independent " Internet Sender.
Quote Arno: You don't want to be "a running litfan."
What is man now?
An 0815 salesperson who is trying to bring his Billo merchandise to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's do's and don'ts.
The naturally apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, people can continue to laugh.
One Krogmann completely lacking empathy and trying to make a profit from the explosion of the rented rooms.
How to find everything well?
If you like it, I think it's wonderful.
I would appreciate it if you could call me back as soon as possible, as my frozen yogurt has gone bad.

Whether as a substitute for breadcrumbs or just for coating – my little helper is versatile enough to be used in many ways.
Kirschkern Kissen are a traditional home remedy for digestive problems, as kirschberries are very good at absorbing heat and can then release it again.
The internal ink can be easily heated up in the microwell or in the back of the envelope.
The thin connection makes the application particularly pleasant to use, so that the children feel protected even if it doesn't work so well for them.
The Kirschkern Kissen with Button is only suitable for the following application areas:
Before the heat of the kiss, check for unusual smell, spots or bruising, and promptly inquire if there is anything wrong.
Please remove the interior decoration before moving!
In the microwell at a maximum of 300 watts for up to 2 minutes (according to the manufacturer's information!)
As soon as the heat rises, the warmth spreads evenly through the fabric!
Then the interior was cleaned up.
With the first flushes, there may be a slight build-up on the surface but this dissipates with repeated applications.
Always stick to the given warning signs, as longer times or higher energy consumption can lead to damage (flammability and combustion risk!).
Check before warming the kissing in the micro-wave, that an activation of the skin products in the advertisement of the manufacturer is allowed.
After putting the wick back in the socket, please check the temperature of the kiss on your arm to ensure it is safe for babies (max. 43 °C)!
You should not use the knife for serious and chronic wounds, hematomas, blood stains, open wounds and for people with reduced sense of pain.
If you have a heart attack, stroke, venereal disease, diabetes or cancer, or if you are pregnant, please see a doctor immediately.
If Nähte has opened and the skin has peeled off, you should remove the product and the skin immediately and unreachable for children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be regularly checked during the use to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product should be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is located.
The connection is durable and works even at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the safety symbol on the product!

Is the battery dead?
Yesterday evening my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my network.
I bought this about 5 months ago, it should still work.
I thought that a single net could also be used to operate.
The display is missing, the battery is empty, and the laptop does not start at all despite being plugged in.
Then I took the battery out, but nothing happened.
Have you got your ideas?
New battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network?
Is that what the other one is?
Many thanks for your help!
I want to deliver the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I do that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
We don't know how high the floor space is.....
Sometimes on tour and despite all the equipment?
With the Peak Design Everyday V2 Backpack no problem!
The 20-liter fuel tank also suffers from larger photo distortions without problems, which can certainly be corrected with polished parts.
And if you need anything else at night, you can keep it under control with practical access to the individually configurable interior space, which is well organized and separates from the photo background.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to V2, the series is presented in a new look.
The minimalist design is intuitive in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some of the most innovative solutions that secure the interior of the backpack and at the same time allow quick access to the camera.
This works with two ways: Once conventionally through the zipper, which can be locked with the MagLatch closing system, a brilliantly concealed solution for effective protection, which has already won acclaim with the Messenger Bags.
In the closing loop there is a closing loop of metal with passengers' anchors on the front side of the backpack.
In contrast to most rucksacks, Peak Design has thought of various "support positions": there are actually four anchor points, stabilized with rubber, into which the strapped-on can be fastened.
If the backpack is full, you just take the top heavy one, it is rather simple, a lighter one.
Claps are also magnetic.
So the backpack can also be securely closed without the keys falling out.
The second option also differentiates the Everyday Backpack from other rucksacks in terms of practicality: in addition to the zipper, there is also a closing mechanism on both sides of the bag.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of using stairs - you no longer have to feel them!
At the same time, this clear detail increases the all-day durability of the backpack enormously: If you don't only take your photo editing, but also everyday objects or travel gear with you.
In the everyday backpack you can individually configure the internal space (more below) and thus both problem-free separate - and by the two recent openings also independently of each other.
This way, you can also pull out the back of the bag from behind the body to focus on the camera lens on the right side of the body, while the day-to-day stuff will definitely stay in the left side of the bag and not get in the way.
Bequeeme, unkompliziert verstellbaren Tragegurte helfen dabei.
And since the main compartment of the bag is completely made from 100 percent recycled nylon, the contents will self-clean even if it is going to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited impatiently for her email from her support team.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday to confirm the
According to the investigation, the delivery of the false goods was announced.
Up to now I have not received any news.
I request immediate intervention.
I am now writing with the third support employee, and I have never gone further than the promise of an email as proof.
It is the transmission of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#
It is then up to us to see when the crisis can be resolved.
I don't have any option...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
Wishing you a nice evening
Hello, my number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp when I ordered it
Please call me
If you extend me the voucher, then I'll give you a bigger order, but in any case I've kept the damaged furniture and not sent it back.
And that last year was different from what I thought it would be and I couldn't wait to hear and prove it.
But the damage I suffered as a customer and I accept that.

Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered a glistening rock on the southern edge of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the novelty quickly wore off and the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49 came to an end.
Thousands came from far and wide and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and flowering cities in the country.
Shrines were smashed, candles were lit, and saloons and hotels emerged almost overnight.
Everyone wanted to take their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was: "Coloma or bust!"
In this game you are a pioneer who is looking for a name in the West.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, purchase horses and build companies.
You will also enjoy the opportunity to explore the surrounding river valleys and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other Pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to overtake your pioneer colleague to avoid falling out with the rest of them.
Coloma is a tough strategy game with many reasons for victory.
You are simultaneously voting for their actions, you have to hold on to their resources and build a tableau which is increasingly working for you ("engine building").
The buildings on your chart allow you to be more efficient, to take additional actions or to change rules at your discretion.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge arch, you can develop your individual style with careful adaptations.
Coloma played a role over a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California officially became a state).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
While every round will select the players home and at the same time choose a location on the game plan where they can carry out actions, this is not enough.
After that, her selection will be revealed and she will place her pions on the passable location.
If a location has the most soldiers, it gets a star!
This deactivates half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players switch actions, for example by winning resources, driving cars, opening stores, positioning themselves as guards, and so on.
If all actions are completed, the Pioneers will return.
At the beginning of each round, the price is moved to a new location and this changes the available actions.
This goes on for so long, until the seller moves five times, so that every location is covered at some point and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players of Coloma have to defend against a dangerous gang.
If the players have enough ammunition and pay the gangsters fairly, they get bonuses.
However, if they fail, they receive lower wages or end up in the cemetery.
After the third shooting, the game ends.
The player with the most victory points wins!

Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation is now on my Twitter timeline and I have seen it right away.
The child psychologist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and holds international awards.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate about education.
Former patient: Innocent until proven guilty.
Please pass on, the film is too difficult to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
It is never acceptable for our parents and other responsible adults to use power over the child.
Our goal must always be to provide the child with a space for his development and a shell for the child that is as big as possible in a situation that is conducive and possible.
Brrr, I still shiver.
Holetschek: States call for threefold extension of test obligation for pregnant women
At their next meeting, the ministers of health from the states want to decide on a national path for the introduction of the test obligation for three times.
Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, said on Sunday's "Bild am Sonntag" that "our countries need clarity as to when and under what circumstances the test obligation applies for three times."
The removal of 2G plus for three times a day is "not only medically acceptable, but also provides an additional incentive," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has announced that "he will submit a proposal for a health minister's conference next Tuesday." − afp
Also I want to send the lamp back
How do I do this best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can't make any more purchases with my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Up, it's a mistake.
The purchase of the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated the data.
Where can this be located?
What you describe as *awareness* is called *consciousness*.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
The most common is hearing voices/sounds, seeing pictures/figures, and hearing pain.
Relevant topic: Cesarean sections are operations that involve a high rate of awareness, as you administer a very deep sedative to protect the baby until they are delivered.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned in the Narkosevorgespräch.
Certain procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) carry a slightly increased risk.
**Edit**: Love everyone, this comment by me is correct Awareness, however, has no definition.
Have you read their comment?
The chair is however defective.
The 20 euros are also not helping us.
These are legal weapons.
The absolute minimum would be to take it back.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please try to take it back at least.
We then sell the second seat privately.
We also lose some money here.
I have already sent you an email that you did not reply to.
Again the question.
In the order and billing, it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room in my choice.
The sender is company #NAME#.
I was just there.
He told me that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order, as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture in the first place.
Why did I not call?
I had a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies at the age of 97
He has become a theater critic and an administrator.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, it is fresh: "A man is getting old."
The disturbing diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle has led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the lecture comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I am showing my lifeblood here."
There are various types of palettes.
One of the most common are Alpacas, which are mainly used as draft animals in Europe.
They will be certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was €79 million.
How many pallets are imported to Austria every year is not mentioned

Tips and tricks for rolling
I had received many great tips for the perfect Gulasch a week ago.
It was Christmas and it was unbelievably delicious and creamy!
Also thank you for that:)
Now I have come to the taste and want to cook roast meat for the first time on Christmas Eve.
I will set up a pension fund for tomorrow.
Have you got any other tips for me?
Reminder: I have no choice but to wear a large top.
What happens now?
What is with the books and how do I get them back to my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is no longer so good, but that's OK
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by mail on January 18 that the refund was successful.
But until today, the money has not arrived at all.
Please check it.
Where there are still Christmas treats in Lübeck
For many people, Gans or Ente are among the holidays, like the tannenbaum and the gifts.
Have they still not got their wings?
Now is the time.
We reveal to you where you can still drink a Christmas punch in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a loud volume adds significantly to the warmth and to the solidity of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the valve reactor division.
With the volume, gain and master volume controls, you can adjust the pitch and volume of your sounds at the same time.
The amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique power level regulator that allows you to adjust the sound without changing anything about the gain and the compression.
Further up, it is already apparent that the POWER LEVEL-Regler can even be used to float the machine if there is no power available.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL-Regler, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The umbrella can also be used as a line of departure.
The following signal is processed with a box simulation so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression when using a headphone or when being approached directly.
You can close the Aux port so that a CD player or MP3 player can be connected, so that you can jam with your favorite songs.
There is also a tuner function on board - you don't need a separate sound device.
If you also get a VFS5 Fußtaster, you can also easily call the sounds with your feet, turn the effects on/off, and adjust the tempo of the largely compatible effects.
This is actually unthinkable for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But that was not the case with others.
Is there then a possibility to return the lamp?
Why is it so low for a stool?
I would then send them back to them.
Can you help me further?
And the fun?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, are you already on the #PRS_ORG# stage
If it doesn't work, I would be happy with a receipt or voucher.
I find a buyer for the furniture.
I only need over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need.
I just received my order and would have liked to know if shredding was part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the hinges.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting period has not been completed
Is there a premium customer status with Euch?
Iran sees progress in negotiations over nuclear agreement
According to Iranian sources, progress has been made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
Both sides are short of agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development," because initially there was not even equality over the issues that were to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks for the renewal of the agreement were intensified after just under a year.
Participants to the negotiations include Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia.
Even a US delegation is present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen overpowers Sachsen - Free State now becomes federal state with higher Corona infections
Thüringen has eliminated Saxony and is currently the highest leader in the country.
As the only federal state, the value of the brand is over 1000.
On Sunday, as the only federal state, Thuringia had a presence of over 1,000 Corona points.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections with 100,000 inhabitants.
In Sachsen, which has always been the highest grade in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the wind was light in Thuringia, but it was also above the value of 1000.
In Thüringen, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths were reported in a day.
On Sunday, 200 seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospital.
On weekends, there may be delays.
In addition, health inspectors have been overworked for weeks and are coming across new cases hardly anymore.
That I understand.
Since the delivery will take place at the beginning of March, it may be possible by then.
I have to take it out and live on it and send it off, was that?
Here I have to do nothing else?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to accept the transmission on my own costs.
The 8 euro tip is a fair amount in my opinion.
It is time for changes
On the Bundestag day I received a greeting, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What is the post here?
If you look at the activity in recent months, you can see that it is not extinct.
We have come into a winter storm and have had the lake off for a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, where is it?
For the most part, this is simply a matter of dissatisfaction, as things have fallen apart here and as we generally stand up for it.
Over the last few days, the impression has been reinforced that many here still have beer on the MBundestag.
#What we must change
At this point, the community is asking around the MBundestag which municipality wants to live with this.
The challenge came from u/edizVEVO, which has become noticeable on this project in recent days and has found a few, just that.
After agreeing to do so, several people from the community found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I also want to call out to everyone to get involved, so that this project can be successful in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which we can come together and work on specific things.
She can access the server through this link.
Objectives:
* What is the future of the MBundestag?
* What are the necessary adjustments / adaptations / removals?
* What should we do in the future in terms of foreign affairs?
* How should new members be appointed?
* How do we create a fair voting system?
I am pretty sure that I have forgotten something, but it is not bad, because at the end of the day we have the discord.
If they have time and desire, come to the Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade for you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/clobbered for my taste.
For this, I have already made another request.
I put it together and then noticed when I took the thin wire.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be accepted and that I will have a full retraction.
This is also quite sad, because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
There is one more question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, is it also in size, that is, in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# should be able to guarantee that the error will be corrected.
And I ask you to leave now.
I didn't have a suitable packing, but I will try to mount it for the removal - they have to sign up with #PRS_ORG#, how that can work.
#PRS_ORG# can call me at any time to arrange a cancellation.
Does it have instructions for the assembly?
How long would I have had time to worry about this and to decide whether to accept it?
How does she respond to the question of why she is vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She has eaten vegetarian for a while, and nowadays she probably rarely eats meat.
I myself have been vegetarian for a few years.
When I was asked if I had ever wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned step, I honestly answered without thinking.
And indeed, for a long time I thought I would be supporting vegetarians with the meat, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that she was angry with me, she defended vegetarianism and said that she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian she reduced herself.
Now I wonder if my answer was too blunt?
How does she respond to the question?
Have the feelings that make you a vegan fastened to your crotch and conflicts arise, without which you wouldn't want to put up with it.
There is a harmonious vegetarian woman (;
It is not clear whether this is an exception to s. 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# is not bound by the legal requirements for remote work.
I am at the appointed date, at which #PRS_ORG# does not collect my returns on site.
Since I cannot be present due to being sick, this cannot be changed either.
Could you please provide an alternative date?
From January 1, #NUMBER# I will be completely back.
Lahnsteiner fund for water purification: €45,000 grant from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, awarded a subsidy of €45,000 to the new water treatment vehicle of the voluntary fire brigade of Lahnstein in the mayor's office of Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounts to 135,000 euros.
Good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatine is supporting us in this regard," says Mayor of Oberbronn Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatine.
They fulfill tasks in water and sewage treatment as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, the boom in the tourism industry on the Rhine and Moselle rivers as well as the continuing increase in the use of the river as a recreational flow all contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read to 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, following their advice, I have synchronised, removed and downloaded the app again NONE of this has worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because I've already spent a lot of time on this campaign and now I'm hoping for help.
Okay, then.
I would like to order three articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG#.
Can I set a date in the order form?

Thank you for that at least, that you are putting the whole thing together here, I have spent almost a decade in a similar position in the public service, too, we used to talk about weapons in the executive, I don't want to get into that again!
The question of right and left always finds me very confused.
In principle, however, it should be said that the state service comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, everyone should also be clear that people who are right-wing, magical-conservative in particular should naturally be hard to convince that these people are then naturally also hard to convince with the relevant reality, because in addition to the average white people, there are now many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and therefore not my overtrained feminine clergy, for there are hardly any of them in the executive) and also on these people you can and must leave.
But these party groups are also represented even if it initially seems odd to me, according to my experience with a conservative attitude, they are proud of Germany and feel that they are being overlooked by the excessively left-wing policies, although these policies seem to them to be legally required to treat them simply normally.
Back to the rights, of course the police and the armed forces are also part of the social fabric of society, and extreme rights are found there too, that these people are allowed to express their opinion openly or even that they are encouraged to do so, completely medially overshadowed and annoyed me too.
Of course, just as police and soldiers often have to put up with negative experiences abroad, they often have to put up with things that are controversial and politically incorrect.
There is also the danger that certain right-wing sympathizers meet each other and talk about an exchange of fire.
However, I believe that wherever my opinion is well received and also with political education and enlightenment the whole will turn!
Germany is so internationalized that that is also good, my opinion is that we cannot tolerate right-wingers and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, I ordered the other Korb on the German side as well.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it, it was not out of stock.
I have already signed in November.
But it was confirmed in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer deliverable.
I have previously contacted #NAME#.
Alternatively, one could send the other #PRS_ORG# Korb for #NUMBER# Euro to Germany in black, or is this Korb available in Germany?
I always find only you as a partner company.
But there are two deep caves on the top of the rock, which have been filled with something blue
And on the mirror there is a small cradle
Ordered by child?
Hello, I'm (w32) engaged in something for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am autonomous, I don't have a lot of free time), but my life is getting more and more bad than good in terms of managing my household in a clean and orderly manner.
There are always phases when everything feels right, and then and there I pack up and go to bed.
But it is never as if someone could spontaneously come to visit.
My husband is (unfortunately) also not better, but at least I don’t have to pay rent anymore.
The kitchen is still cleaned regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, has it been easier for you to get along with your child?
We haven't worked on it yet, but this question has been occupying me for a long time.
Because I don't have a fetish for it, it doesn't bother me that much, as long as no one is visiting and so on.
Have you ever had a bigger thrill with a child or do you stay clingy?
Enjoy your responses.
Exclusive, new, and of high quality as well as anatomically shaped, it offers maximum comfort, a perfect pass form and thus allows for almost total freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with a personality disorder?
I have a degree in software development and have been unemployed for about a year.
However, I am getting more and more annoyed that this calling is not the right one for me, why I have been studying this again and again for a long time and to study social work.
The problem: I have a self-hosted (or frighteningly redundant) personal computer.
That means that I don't have any self-esteem and I'm afraid of it.
I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but it is very difficult for me to conduct in-depth conversations and I have already been told that I sound artificial (although that is what I think has become better).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a streetworker or in the open youth group, rather I want to work in examples such as volunteer work or family aid.
I don't know whether the actual working day is really like that, as I imagine it, and it's hard to find something like that on the Internet.
The AVPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it makes me feel like I have to check my code every time ("just check the simplest things again") and it is hard for me to ask experienced colleagues for help ("I should now know how it goes/"I should stop him from my work" etc.).
I will probably have problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it at the time.
But have you held onto the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation either.
I waited for a date for release
Could you please return it?
If I have a book on the #PRS_ORG# hashtag, the message says your #PRS_ORG# author disapproves of this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a confirmation of my order.
The egg white (protein) the bird consumes is carried in its stomach to its intestinal tract, where it is broken down into individual amino acids, which the bird also needs for tissue repair.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the renewal of feathers in the adult bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with the totality of the animal's organ systems.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio cannot be diluted during cultivation as it can lead to disturbances in the fermentation process.
In the meantime, NEKTON-Bio should be replaced by NEKTON-S (a multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (a mineral supplement).

One gram of NEKTON-Bio per 250 milliliters of water or 100 grams of cheese.
It is recommended to only prepare as much drinking water/juice as the bird drinks every day and change it every day.
One scoop of vanilla ice cream (optional) corresponds to 1 gram of NEKTON Bio.
With severe injuries, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-BIO can be given at the beginning, until the approach of wound healing is visible.
After that, the normal dose will be delivered until the patients are fully recovered.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored without sun exposure, between 15° and 25°C.
Please forgive them, but the chair will be sold as an office chair.
How can a city council after 9 months be dismantled?
The trial in Germany is 24 months.
That is really bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order was damaged and pictures were taken.
Have you received this email?
Responding to a complaint by a community worker
Hello r/legaladviceGerman,
I have following problem.
An apple tree is to be planted on our plot.
Also complaint to the municipality.
One of my colleagues writes to me that the cases of obstetrics and gynecology are not part of the bill.
In the sentence, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement?
On the one hand, I have to let go of an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the sentence is clearly stated.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging.
I have no news
Naja, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you please provide me with a check or a certificate?
What were the more expensive?
Yes, that's what I think, just the question is whether I can pay in euros and get the ceiling off to Germany
Can you check it?
Eilmeldung: Heavy traffic accident at Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St. 2179 between the junction station Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
According to the press alarm of the police (14:03), a car crashed into the oncoming traffic.
There are injured.
Okay, I understand.
Good, then many thanks again for it being so easy!
Rat and ideas for further professional life
First of all, happy holidays to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately too short because my head is always thinking about what people can think.
Before I come to the point: I need help and preferably from people who know my situation - that is, from you.
I am doing this as a joke.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in a field there (at least a little bit anonymously, I won't lie to you exactly).
But then it became too long and I looked at alternatives that could make me more fun.
One day I landed at the office and sure enough, it was - even if the working conditions are considerably more relaxed than in my previous job, but that was okay.
I have now arrived at the third "Google other spelling".
And it's only half a year old.
In the games before, I always decided to continue, at least to finish the round, and then I can relax.
But I'm just completely done.
I had so little free time the last month that I completely exhausted myself.
Now it's holidays, but there is still a load of work waiting for me.
Before the race, I always thought I would be stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my birthday.
There I was free.
And the stress on the job was equal at the moment.
Now the family holiday is too much stress for me.
And then there are these star structures that make me extra nervous.
In principle, it is fun and the feedback also looks good, which affects the feed and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and ask myself how much stress my body can withstand before it completely crumbles - if it doesn't already.
I ask myself whether I want to live the rest of my life like this - just when I read some of your contributions - or whether I should go back to the old area, where I was appreciated, I could take my time when I needed it, and the work was worthwhile even though it was long and boring, because it was paid fairly and in a team effort that was done, not as an individual fighter like now, the majority of the time.
But then I ask myself, am I not going to the same place again in a year and be dissatisfied?
You see, it all seems so ironic, but perhaps she thinks of me as an outsider or an idea, like I got away from this situation, which I am completely done with and almost at the lowest ebb, crying.
I'm not going to make decisions now that I'm so emotional, which probably won't do any good.
But perhaps my views will help me at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or celebrate Christmas, which is enough for me already.
Thank you for reading and forgive the slight tone of my voice.
I hope my situation is at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has continued to develop, leading the way in the combination of the progressive modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" division, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a turbocharger.
With the VT20X/ VT40X/ VT100X Amps, we offer a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely at the cutting edge of technology in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (virtual element technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amps, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity which is absolutely remarkable.
This amp also includes the more powerful Valvetronix amplifier.
This is partly due to actual analog tuning, because these the pitch variations and nuances of a horn player are simply better captured than any simulation.
In addition to this, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed room and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances are only echoed.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct historical facts on the virtual stage until the amp and the effects sound as if you have already planned it.
The perfect combination of sound and modeling technology is first and foremost due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Obviously, she has since been punished several times to accommodate new sound requirements, which annoyed the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 again - with more dynamism and numerous and improved amplifier models.
From the hand-held VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speaker outputs, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists can find a maximum sound variety here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and the dynamism of a drum machine: they expect a full sound, a nuanced reflection of sound dynamics and volume, and a prompt answer.
While conducting an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the amplitude of the sound is determined by the amplitude of the voltage and developed the VOX valve reactor technology on the basis of this discovery.
The valve reactor division of a 12AX7 reeds provides the behaviour, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a reed valve amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points by Wagner: Magic lose against Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing series in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it won't be enough against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven of his older brother Moritz's, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
In addition, the main face is adjustable: with three individually adjustable pressure and tilt parts, it is perfectly adapted to the needs of your photo editing and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from simple system cameras up to full-frame mirror reflex cameras.
What ends up in the backpack ultimately depends on the size of the camera and the object.
A possible purchase would be a DSLR camera with an articulated lens, two to three zoom lenses, and a built-in flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still have room for more lenses.
In addition, one can still buy a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the bag for your equipment and for taking photos.
Even drone pilots reach an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption in La Palma: The longer the story
In the almost three months since the beginning of the break, the lavastorm on the Canary Islands has caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 has been the longest on the Atlantic coast of Africa, with 84 days.
There are no reliable data about previous arrests.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has somewhat decreased in recent days, but volcanologists did not give any predictions about when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in millions of dollars
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the more than 1,000-degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other structures, as reported by RTVE.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a thin lava flow.
That is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new landforms, about 50 hectares in size, arose on the coastline due to the eruption of lava.
The banana cultivation on the island, which is immensely important for the island, suffered heavily, from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the eruption of the volcano.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and gifts
Christmas is approaching and especially children will hardly be able to wait to see the holy festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have bound up with the spiritual atmosphere and the solemn tension.
Winter is one of the few traditional preparations that still keep our increasingly fragmented society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the religious tradition of knotting, so that the gesture of knotting, which has been the result of the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, and which was a voluntary "contract of nature" between humans and the natural world, becomes routine again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became Christ
The protesters were severely beaten, causing bruising throughout the night.
Previously, gifts were exchanged on the evening of the Nikolaustag.
The background for this still popular scene is that the Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, threw gold into the windows of three women in a dream to give them another life in Smyrna.
From this unconventional kind of storage, the popular consumption of chocolate went up, especially among children.
Protestants reject this demand because they consider it to be a violation of God and man as "sacred persons."
For this reason, they are opposing the institution.
Martin Luther made from the skull of Nikolaus the Christkind and justified this with a new tradition.
The focus of the crime is on the holy night.
Since most protesters no longer see such detail questions that way, it only irritates the few that the use of the holy Nikolaus is as much a part of the pre-Christmas festivities as is the use of Martinis and Martinmas cake.
Today you find yourself in the creases in front of the tower and under the Christmas tree, up to luxurious deluxe rooms, which warm the heart.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Quotes recall a tradition of penning a prayer for the dead since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of penance is changed to a holy evening.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a lively debate about who now takes care of the children.
In Germany, it depends on the particular region whether the Christkind am Heiligen Abend appears or the Weihnachtsmann, who in principle is a kind of Nikolaus, is appointed at the time.
These include, for example, his white waistcoat, which is only a little more common with the rather strict Assyrian waistcoat of the historical figure, his slip, which is taken away by the priest and the effort required to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, the Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at the Christmas festival.
In Spain, the Three Holy Kings give the blessing, while in Italy the Hexe Befana are said to have guided them to Jesus.
In Scandinavia, in contrast, the custom is to bring gifts, while in Russia the father gives his son a blessing with a kiss.
Here are not reptiles, but three horses that are pulling their loads as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars, the Christkind is responsible for the transmission of the gifts.

Police arrest suspected bank robbers near the palace
On Saturday near the Kensington Palace in London, a man was shot by the police.
Police said the caller had reported a man who had gone to a bank armed with a gun and robbed a bookstore.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was later stopped by officers.
There were shots fired and the man was hit.
He was still declared dead at the scene.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
Several messages have been left in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

On the other hand, the "smart stone" is quite harmless: The sun alone ensures that these glowing wonders are fascinatingly reflected – sometimes in white or black light (in equal six different colors).
The transparent, amorphous design is consciously chosen: This modern light object appears day and night like a large natural stone.
His organic rings pass in every natural environment - whether on the lawn of the terrace, on the pavement or on the stone wall.
He is also doing well in neighbouring countries, such as Groß Kiesel and Findlingen, where he can boast a large family.

His solar module covers the "smart stone" discreetly in its interior, together with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for yellow light.
The battery is already charging when the solar light falls on the roof.
With its built-in dimmer, "Smart Stone" is even more energy-saving; in which colour you can choose: Six attractive light colours are at your disposal - alongside day and night white - to choose from.

Pillenproblem
Hello dear woman,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year Reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such unbelievable bad pain during the period and was scared of PMS during the period.
Now I would like to keep this a secret because I need to take too many medicines that I cannot afford.
My main problem, unexpectedly not causing pain, but my skin.
I had received a total of 0 to 100 explosions in my last unbroken pause of about two years and this was it.
So far so good, but I feel quite heavy and I am not feeling well.
In the two-year break, the whole thing never really normalised.
Maybe there's some tips to avoid this one.
Free of perfume and without dyes, my cosmetics are already, but maybe there's something I can recommend.
Unfortunately, the obstetrician did not take me seriously and the pediatrician is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, love is such a small thing.
If you suffer from severe neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then widespread itching and acne.
In the course of his illness, I have also tried everything I could and am still on laxatives, milk and gluten-free biscuits because otherwise nothing has worked right.
It can also be good that hormones are just a wave of the ocean, but if you want to build all over, you might as well go for it and look for what otherwise would be lost.
I already had all their colleagues smiled at me.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was replied to my request.
I have to work constantly and on the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What if the money was there, would I have seen it
Please check my bank data, maybe there is something wrong

Hello, unfortunately I am not in the Kundenkonto yet.
Could you please send me the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# by email to the above mentioned mailing address?
What is the material of the packaging?
We have no way of recording this for so long.
We would like to use the table as they do

Does the pain need to be completely removed and replaced?
And when would the release be?
110 kV cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the transfer of the new high tension cable to Tann is legally sound.
The Niederbayern government’s decision to approve the plan for the construction of the building makes the way clear for the start of construction in 2022.
Now the network provider Bayernwerk announced this.
The seven-kilometer-long cable will be the backbone of the Tann power plant in the north of the commune and will connect the existing 110-volt system between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a mast of the Freileitung near the village of Edermanning in Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03/01/21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived partially at us.
The blue Betsellnummer: #PRS_ORG# with the sending number #NUMBER# was sent back to #PRS_ORG# with the message "Arrival not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a configuration is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the further procedure is now?
A beautiful start in the week!
You can forget that I explained that a few days ago!!
This is a comforter made of glass and all the pages are stuck on, so that all glass and the cardboard is broken
The comforter is in my room and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into my room because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the dressing table cannot be moved because no-one in my house is allowed to move
Thanks for the news
But why only 20 euros?
The origin of this chair is #NUMBER# EUR
No, it applies to all libraries, for that reason the enquiry about #PRS_ORG#, since it seems to be a general problem
Ref: Lesson plans (EK)
Hello colleagues,
I've been in rehab for the past summer, and I feel like I'm having fun with school, but right now I have a lot of problems with time management to plan my education in the field of environmental science.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I basically only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In school I can only copy free of charge (which is nerve-wracking).
I just need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors and I actually have a whole hour for myself.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand I do not want to invest too much time in simple teaching hours (which I also need for UBs).
I actually always start planning from the learning goal (which is what I want to achieve) and then I look at how I can build it up (usually I make an outline with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am more than happy with most of the tasks in the book.
This is why also the working papers.
Maybe I can work with someone like that who can focus on the book.
It really pleased me.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one for #PRS_ORG# though I would appreciate it if you could get back to me as quickly as possible.
The trade is in danger because of the 2G regulation.
In most businesses, only those who are sick or ill can work.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains about price cuts.
He also has a possible solution.
According to the trade association Germany (HDE), the 2G regulations are harming the important Christmas trade.
In stores with articles that are not suitable for children, it is illegal to charge sales tax, criticized head of the HDE, Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies viewed the rest of the year negatively.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
What was supposed to be the positive peak of the year is now often a lake without bottom, said Genth.
As a result, dealers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their business in the past week.
It just doesn't work in the retail sector or online.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygienic concept is a safe event, said the chief executive.
′′ 2G brings us not further in the fight against the pandemic ", he stressed.
The current regulations are harsh on customers and require high personnel input.
He demanded that the regulations be implemented nationwide.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked on 2G (cellular) and would have access to all stores in that day.
In addition, in the retail trade - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (received, transmitted or tested) - it is to be ensured that samples are checked.
Even the specialist real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, spoke of a difficult Christmas period.
Recently, without 2G, the frequencies were at about 75 percent of the pre-COVID-19 level, with around 90 percent.
These figures will certainly fall in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said Managing Director Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
As a result of the high personal and administrative demands, the Center is trying to find solutions and gain approval.
This includes the so-called cell unlocking, in which "visitors can for example get their 2G signal at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel - destroy all businesses." dpa
I recently ordered the #PRS_ORG# and received it.
The mirror has a crack and on the back is also a mistake that was tried to be fixed with a blue filler.
That looks bad.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it again and wrapped it.
What should I do now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, thin SMD LEDs with high performance and high light output.
For the adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities is used.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperature: daylight and nightlight.
It is also possible to set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K manually.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
One special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The light creates a very bright light with a soft light of high quality, completely free of glare.
The 120-degree divergence, which allows you to see large areas at a relatively small distance, is impressive.
Incidentally, too, in reporting situations in small rooms or for brief periods.
They can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on both the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller enables the remote control of the lights in television studios or when the lights are mounted on difficult to reach points.
On the back is the control panel, which consists of buttons and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness level in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is still room for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery)
Answering device The device has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to transfer the settings of the individual settings to the storage slots, it is enough to simply press on one of the storage buttons and finish.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when the switch is turned on, so that the well-known situation is again set in case of new switches - Very practical in the studio work, if the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of the DL3120 is the functionality of the business.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also be checked before the set to see if the batteries have enough performance - it is a battery tester with built-in - for each of the two battery chargers a value in the two display screens (left battery charger, right under the display).
In addition, it is naturally possible to supply the eyes with energy through the internet.
The construction of the skull is very simple.
They have a 16mm Hülse as an anchorage to securely mount it directly to your photo station.
The agreement is to be confirmed by both sides through formalities.
This has also been taken into account by the mechanical components, which are extremely sophisticated, and accordingly, also on longevity and hard usage.
In addition, there is a spare tire in the delivery.
It is also a bag in the retail supply.
This way, you can transport the lights with all the accessories that you may still want to buy, without any problems.
I'm sorry, I lost that and it's too small:(
′′ Party that we wanted to see: Frankfurt celebrates after towering comeback against Leverkusen
Was for a spectacular reaction of Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in the series, the Hessen team seemed to be on its way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then SGE came up with it, shot the frustration out of a season-opening defeat by the Seele within an hour and won with 5-2. It is a wonderful feeling to see the boys deliver today, said coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and declared an “instant lob, to each and every one, that was with them”.
It was initially seen as a chance for the Frankfurt team, now ranked ninth, to move closer to their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led Leverkusen with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
′′ How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance ", said Glasner further.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we showed and of course also with the result.
Defensive player Christopher Lenz, who has been back on the pitch since the fourth game day and his torn muscle, also stressed the moral of his team-mates.
I think our mindset is unbelievably big," said the 27-year-old and looked pleased with the result, especially to the audience.
That was the party we wanted to smite today.
However, for the upcoming tasks, Glasner now wants to focus on them, and is also taking a good look at the staff situation.
It is unusual that all players are fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live professionally.
Now they want to "go one step further and remain honest" and complete the tasks by the end of the year "at this level."
As the next game is on Wednesday in the lead-up to the English week, Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 p.m., Sky) is on the agenda.
I receive my grade mail because there was a mistake in my package.
I've tried to reply to #PRS_ORG# but it won't let me.
Can it be sent directly to me again or must I wait until the money is returned and the order is again given?
I was sad to hear that because it had already been waiting for a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# stage?
Women's handball faces Spain in the quarter finals
After defeating Denmark, Germany's women's handball players shrugged with contorted bodies and vacant glances from the stands.
At the end of the World Cup quarter-final, the DHB team defeated the Spanish team at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to fight for a place in the quarter-finals against hosts Spain.
We were too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent, said national coach Henk Groener.
We must approach Spain differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the top group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's sad that we couldn't take the flow.
That was a bad game that we have to lose, said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the semi-final place against the World Cup champions in 2019 on Tuesday, a clear increase is needed in order to keep the dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Another German competitor in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Alina Grijseels with six goals.
We were simply not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense, said referee Xenia Smits and called: "We have to look ahead quickly now."
From front to back not on the height
Unlike in the previous five tournaments, the German team was not at the top with the ball.
Fouls and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a slow 0-4 defeat after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at construction temperature and prevented with several layers of tow.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team at 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully tackled an opponent.
However, the initial hope was not realized.
The German women were hardly able to cope with the aggressive coverage of the women - and when they did, it was mostly on the strong of Althea Reinhardt in the face of the Scandinavians.
So it was early in the third period at 3:10 p.m. that the game turned, especially because the back-up player Mia Zschocke saw red after a hard foul on her opposite number.
However, in the quarter-final, she may meet again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come a little bit better into play and by the break at least on five goals.
Without any hope of a comeback after the change, the only hope was after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again the green rescuers came out on top in all categories and made it to the finals of the medal candidates, which is simply amazing.
In the end, the German team could no longer increase their performance and went out as losers from the park.
Church calendar day 6: Family traditions in the Christmas season
As part of the Reddit advent calendar, we've put on the Nikolaustag and used it as an excuse to start celebrating family traditions in the lead-up to Christmas, Nikolaus, the holy night and the Christmas holidays.
What was that like in your home country?
How about your partner?
Would you also like to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the best for the children?
The detention?
Climbing back?
Shrubs?
Will you be mustered?
When the Christmas man comes, the Christkind or is the gift from Oma and Opa?
In the same way, no matter how they make it, everyone comes together around Christmas and makes the effort to be as happy as possible as a family.
Whether this is now a fixed tradition, or even every year something different: he tells us how it was in your family, or how it was in your family!
Please provide me with a transaction number. Or otherwise, something that could help
Transfer confirmation... etc
I would like to try a clever code
as with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Does that work for them?
There is a title to that, I am working as an infectious disease specialist in mobile teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is being administered in care homes.
Since this is soon going to be completed in a large part, it then goes to the medical centre for me for further treatment.
I would gladly answer questions about the organisational and human aspects, as well as medical aspects, provided they are not personalised (e.g. "I take medication X, it affects my treatment..").
In my area of work, the instruction for the inspection, the indication statement (a person has the right to be inspected under the Corona infection rules and there are no grounds for this), the medical documentation and the emergency provisions for allergic reactions (I have never seen this before).
The inspection itself is delegated to qualified personnel, for example medical specialists.
In teams, however, we do not often have any of them, but only pharmacist-technical assistants for the preparation of the drugs, which cannot cause any side effects (can they?), so that I can also feel most of the side effects myself.
Threatened "Escape Artist": Amberger knows the solution
What is a "fooler"?
With this dialect word, used by an Amberger, a strong message has been conveyed in the BR television broadcast "We in Bavaria."
But unlike many other days, the term "host mi?" was unmistakable from the caller.
No, it was not a'man who is nervous'.
And no one, "everything has to go quickly."
This, the people heard from the TV moderator, is completely wrong.
Where the man from Amberg shared the solution and thus probably also helped many Oberpfalzers for the first time.
The hunchback, the audience can hear, "is a trick with which someone fools people".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been asked by Bayerischer Fernsehen as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical upper-palatine word, it is somehow transmitted from the well known word "hounds".
What was closed was a gap in education - probably also in some of those who have lived in Amberg for a long time.
I can't buy any more books for two weeks.
There is always the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG# with the PC connected, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing has been stolen.
Reifenwahl beim Rennrad - really so safe?
Today morning I'm feeling very rested because I wanted to train for my road cycling tour next week at least a little.
Asked, done and I drove my racing car, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40 km were also really nice - but then it was like that in every town (this time: Danke Krefeld!).
Glass splitter on the road.
Zack, loud and clear, wanted to join the rest of the line no matter what.
Since I had no real chance of getting any sleep on the weekend, I had to drag myself out of bed with half a bad sleep and take the bus home.
War dann auch noch nicht ganz so schlimm, vielleicht es ist ja auch besser, wenn ich das mit dem Reifenwechsel übe.
But now I stand before a question and hope that she can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route over several days ahead of me, I would be extremely unprepared for this problem.
We were really not bad now, for the old owner (a rather clever old man, by the way, I’ve ridden away from him 120 km by 4 p.m.) and the one who was also calling this suboptimal because he has driven them with them for many years.
But if I think I'm going to drive to 80-90 kms and still have to stop for a rest, I'm really feeling bad:)
Now I'm talking to an older man at the train station, who asked me why I didn't run the Marathon Plus marathons; those should be flat.
Now the whole thing sounds very promising.
But are they really so broken?
I don't have much interest in giving away €40 now, just to disappoint them.
I continue to ask myself: I feel like I am on the Rennrad right now at 25x622.
There are also (apparently?) in the Marathon Plus runs, but the bulk is already further.
Is this a problem?
Or would you like me to tell you about other rides at a race track?
The Schwalbe-Seite seems to be my absolute! Do you prefer the Durano DD?
Thank you for the help and love!

After the publication of our new high-end brand B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series also saw a comeback.
SOLO 15 is the new sprinter and reminds optically of the big picture with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a passably designed step directly incorporates to raise the speaker's voice to the correct hearing position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can thus be adapted to the needs of the home accordingly.
Principally, the SOLO 15 is suitable for people who play an important part, but the maximum volume should be reached at a rather subdued level.
It is simply not possible to generate such a large sound pressure with just a 10 cm microphone.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the other hand, she is very well developed and impressively large for her size.
Tonal was the SOLO 15 with a light high tone.
This is generally common sense among drivers to optimise the heavy bundle of papers.
Exactly on the spot, the SOLO 15 convinced with very clear and weak sound.
The high ground area can be reduced slightly, so the soundscape can be made warmer.
Thanks to the percussion case, the arrangement of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is accurate and precise.
The reference suspected extremely small mechanical losses of the B 100-6 OHM for a friend dynamism, which is its own search.
The SOLO 15 adds not only to our SOLO series, but extends this in terms of flexibility and accuracy.
As is the case with all our buildings, at the beginning of the design process it is recommended to think about the final optical design of the facade in order to plan appropriate changes to the construction.
For example, if one wants to furnish the rooms, the reduction of the ceiling height must be taken into account, as the ceiling is still adding material.
After all the records have been removed (e.g. at the tree shop), a 8 mm hole should be drilled into the floor at the corresponding place to be able to run the cable there later on smoothly.
With the help of an overhead crane, the opening of the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be commissioned.
The opening with a 45° phase was to be avoided as much as possible in order to increase the area of the opening in the inner part as much as possible.
The four overheating points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive a break in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
After that, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two sides on a flat surface in front of you.
On this, the reverse side, the scarf, the front and the bottom are covered.
The three embankments should also be used and buried.
The thicknesses of the materials themselves can vary depending on the requirements in the material strength, if, for example, one wants to use finished goods from the wood market instead of making them from 16 mm MDF.
The second side will be brought forward in the next step.
After that, all the plates of the floor, that is, the two sides and the front, are removed.
With a passenden lochkreissäge or a forstnerbohrer, the loading of the opening of the bass reflex horn, as well as the connecting piece on the reverse, is made easier.
Finally, a round saw is used to round off all corners of the actual box.
The side of the plate can also be rolled up.
Afterwards, the floorboards are glued to the floor of the house with the help of the floorboards and further glued with long wood screws.
There is a marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill bit) of the corrosion points of the speaker chassis and the connection screws.
After the wooden structure has been dismantled (cut down / pulled down), one begins with the loading of the truck.
At the very least, this is achieved by the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back.
In this way, the entire and undamaged cable piece for piece is passed through the 8 mm bore in the head to the terminal opening and is left there about 30 cm high.
In the upper part of the hall, the cable leads to the speaker opening and can also be pulled out there.
Next, the frequency is adjusted and applied.
The frequency plan and the corresponding supplementary plan can be obtained from the following document: Montageanleitung Weiche Solo 15.
If the wiring is installed and the outer terminal is scratched, the 8 mm cable opening in the inner box is opened, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little trick, you can let out the hot chocolate and thus close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the abdication can be checked accordingly.
Now follows the beating according to description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is closed and the corresponding screws are tightened.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the leading (marked cable) must be cut off at the plus pole of the speaker (higher contact).
At the end, the bass reflex is cut to the length of 28 mm (the total length of the horn) and embedded.
To combat the cold, a mattress of the insulation material is laid in two parts and stored in the loft.
The opening of the bass reflex channel should be released.
Can I give a order now and deliver in early June?
Hello everyone
Finally, we can announce that we will also be holding the OSCAST this year!
We are unfortunately not able to get more than four people in the studio for the same reason as mentioned above, which means that there will be a higher planning expenditure and a shorter notice period.
ABER: At least three people per table will be there, so that we can follow the Oscars 2021 with at least seven bottles in the stream and hopefully follow you too!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - so we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will be about 0:30.
You can already feel the drinks cold, make a good meal and prepare for a long, but very interesting night.
