浙大学术 year conference students take the lead in singing the main role of research results - Xinhua News Agency
Using air to wash hands, sniffing to judge the disease, and accurately searching for the source of smog. Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Year of Zhejiang University, a series of brilliant academic achievements were honored.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. The research covers a wide range of environmental, mechanical, energy, medical, life science, and humanistic education. Students have started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won prizes in China and abroad.
Biological sensor: Your family doctor
The team of biomedical engineering graduate student Zhang Di Ming on the spot demonstrated a bio-sensor on the mobile phone, which is only half the size of the mobile phone.
You just need to breathe a little, and the device can detect your health condition from the gas components you breathe.
Zhang Di Ming said that the sensor was connected to the smartphone, and when the gas was called, the health report would be shown on the smartphone.
In the market, smart wristbands that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This bio-sensor uses a new material called graphene, which has a sensitive "smell" that allows it to reflect health more accurately and deeply.
Intelligent surgery light: The high energy eyes of doctors
In addition to smart phones, smart surgery lights have also been used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver medal at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
The team of PhD student Zhu Linping and Xu Junfei from the School of Optics and Engineering opened a new approach in the shortcomings of traditional surgery lights and invented an intelligent LED surgery invisible light.
Many diseases cannot be detected at an early stage, and the doctor's operating room light is related to it.
申俊飞 said, for example, when the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, the cancer cells will still spread.
This intelligent surgery light has four light plates, and can enhance the distinction between different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and invisibility of the light spot according to the needs of the operation and personal habits at any time.
This intelligent surgery light has been used in hospitals such as the Shao Yifu Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University Medical School and the Children's Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University Medical School and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Use air to wash hands: save water and cool
For ordinary people, washing their hands is to use water to wash, which is not more than to use soap and to squeeze hand sanitizer, while Li Xincang and other classmates have invented a "airless hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the device's hand basin, our weight can compress the air.
It is like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
So, we can wash our hands clean! ”
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiment proved that the effect of washing hands by this method was the same as that of ordinary washing hands.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can guarantee the cleanliness and save 90% of the water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, in the second Global Major Challenge Summit, this invention stood out in many world-class universities and won the only gold medal.

An important certificate - Emergency Card
This is one of the skills certificates I think is important besides driving license!
普及一下: emergency measures are actually emergency rescue when there is an emergency, which is before the arrival of the ambulance.
It is well known that there is still a certain period of time after the accident, and this is the most important period.
At this time, it is necessary to take emergency measures.
If I really have a heart attack, stroke, and sudden death, our life window is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So, it's so important to know how to CPR!
When we have someone fall down, we can rescue him by using the professional knowledge, rather than just stand there and do nothing, which makes the helpless feeling so terrible.
In China, we have three million accidental deaths every year, and the most dangerous is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the average is 15%.
In Las Vegas casinos and hotels, 70% can be saved, and Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%."
This is the first reaction of founder Lu Le.
If a person has cardiac arrest, breathing has stopped, and the heartbeat has stopped, you will have no effect on pressing the middle finger.
It is impossible to save the person by performing artificial respiration and chest compressions.
I found that there are still few people who have this consciousness to learn CPR, but it is too late when things happen, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill and be able to react in time when facing emergencies.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
The emergency permit can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. There are also discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is of the goal that I had to complete before my 25th birthday, and adding the emergency permit to the list of goals was a few months ago, but it was actually done!
Then we have to take other certificates that we want to take. We plan to take a scuba diving certificate. I saw on the red book that there is a scuba diving rescue certificate. It seems that you have to have a rescue certificate to take the certificate. So the rescue certificate is really useful!

First of all, I think that the film "Sea of Thieves" is a total failure in all senses.
But if you say that this movie is not a highlight, it is not at least a good choice of music.
There are many kinds of bad films, which can make you fall asleep in the cinema, and which can make you furious after watching. For the audience, “Four Seasons” is like a monkey on Mount Everest. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Jin is truly gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation of Creasy's novel, difficult to describe, and with so many holes that it looks like the windbreaker on Mr. Magoo.
Even after you have watched it, you will doubt whether there is a hidden metaphor hidden in it, but when you think carefully, you will find that it is actually a piece of shit.
First of all, I have difficulty understanding some scenes.
The main character should live on a small island in the southern part of the country, and be supported by his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and the plot was arranged for a big uncle to drive a small car to take her to the north to see the snow.
The elderly man sat in a car from the south to the north to see the snow?
He and his father are still very confident.
Then, the old man lost his way.
How did the owner of the hotel get the business license on the abandoned ship?
Why did the gangster on the island be able to make a road in a matter of minutes?
Then, the truck that delivered the钢筋 to the middle of the road stopped at the edge of the road, and the truck driver was nowhere to be found.
This effect is too obvious.
Why did a criminal with poor credit and suspected of violating the law become a police officer?
Why don't they call the police when facing high interest loans? In the movie, the police even asked if there were difficulties.
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a hotel key to open the door and force himself to sleep in the room outside?
This inexplicable situation permeates the entire film, and because the situation is so far-fetched, I feel pain when I recall it.
In addition to the plot, the worse is the movie's theme, or that the movie has no theme at all, which is a repulsive stitch-up monster.
At the beginning of the film, you may think that he wants to make a comedy film, and 20 minutes later, you may think it may be a motivational film, and when you watch half of it, you may think it may be a story about the hardships of the young people in the small town, and when you finish watching it, you may not know what you have seen at all, and then you will have deep doubts about yourself, why do you want to go to the cinema to watch a fart at the big feast?
For most people, it is actually very familiar with the pattern of various movies, such as if you want to shoot a motorcycle driver, then you should be inspired + comedy and tell the audience a talented novice how to achieve success step by step.
If you want to make a love film, you have to tell the love story between the small town youth who likes riding motorcycles and the waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot should not present something contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the role of the new motorcycle just burned, and the role of singing) cannot go to open some mindboggling.
As for the female protagonist, who is clearly not mentally retarded, she behaves like a five-year-old child in some aspects. I don't know if this is due to acting or the director's request.
There is also one thing I don't understand, why is the Korean racing driver so enthusiastic about adding a collision scene in his own movie?
Such a movie arrangement is made in the Spring Festival, is it to make the audience frustrated?

The inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment introduction:
郑州宜欣 is a professional manufacturer of concrete inspection shaft module brick machine equipment, inspection shaft brick machine equipment, and wall module machine equipment in China. From semi-automatic to fully automatic production lines.
Through years of practice and development, it has now been able to produce high-quality hydraulic, mobile and fully automated inspection well series equipment and associated equipment.
Production and processing equipment of inspection well concrete modules:
The characteristics and advantages of the production and processing equipment of inspection well concrete modules in Zhengzhou:
The equipment of the brick machine of the inspection well is widely used for the new construction materials of coal, hot water, electricity, gas and other municipal underground structures.
For example: inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, sewage tanks and small structures, and bridge wing walls.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells lies in the fact that the four corners of the module are all grooves, and the combination of the module forms a chain.
The shear strength of the wall of the well is far better than the form of friction brick construction.
The module is a hollow structure, and after being assembled and built, the vertical holes are connected and the horizontal holes are continuous. After the core of the hole is casted, a meshed concrete structure is formed, which has served as a secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The cross section of the module is equipped with a rivet hole, and the horizontal and vertical rivets are correspondingly increased to improve the overall strength of the structure.
The inspection well and drainage well built using concrete inspection well modules are less likely to collapse, sink, leak and other phenomena. The mechanical performance of the wall module of the well is stable, the operation is simple and the molding size is standardized.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment intelligent control equipped with data input and output devices can realize the ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material, density operation, safe logic control and fault diagnosis system by one-button touch LCD monitor.
The mechanical and hydraulic system of the wall module of the well wall adopts single cylinder hydraulic and conveying, double cylinder hydraulic and conveying.
An independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the influence of vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment distribution box marching mold box lifting, storage box door closing, automatic conveyor plate, all by hydraulic system, so as to reduce mechanical wear and repair.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers and electrical appliances, sealing parts and hydraulic parts, and ensures the stability and reliability of the equipment.
The mechanical vibration platform of the well wall wall body module adopts a whole plate steel, and the cutting line of the table is not welded, so that the filler box can freely swing and guide, so as to fully reduce the mechanical wear.
To reduce the load on the mold and reduce the load on the packing material, the vibration amplitude is combined and encrypted, and the vibration is integrated and synchronized, so as to ensure that the vibration is achieved.
The mechanical vibration module of the well wall and the computer automatic control of the amplitude are adjusted according to the competitiveness of the raw materials to adjust the amplitude, without wear and tear, so as to extend the service life and reduce the cost.
The wall module of the well is equipped with two functions of automatic control and manual control.
Check well mold:
The inspection well of Yixin brick machine is made of concrete blocks:
One corner of the factory:

South African doctor: Omikron's transmission is strong, but most are mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Covid variant Omicron are less severe than those caused by the Delta variant, although the transmission speed is faster.
According to the Associated Press, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in a hospital in the town of Hoddesdon, South Africa, said that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they treat are relatively mild, such as body pain and cough, similar to those of the flu.
The director of the organization, Anben Pillay, said he saw dozens of patients every day, but none of them needed hospitalization.
皮莱 said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that it includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to fall into a critical condition due to coronavirus infection.
He said that compared with it, in the previous wave of Delta outbreak, his new coronavirus patients were breathing hard and had low oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.
In the two weeks after the first report of the Omushegan variant strain in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although collecting enough data will take several weeks, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the conclusion of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30% of the new COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in recent weeks were seriously ill, which was half of the proportion of severe illness in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospitalization time was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent COVID-19 patients died, while the death rate in the early outbreak of COVID-19 in South Africa was 20%.
The head of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports as follows: "At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a mild disease."
He added: "At present, it is early. We need to obtain late data.
Usually, the time of hospitalization and death is later, while we entered this wave of epidemic only two weeks ago. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and the hospitalization rate, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the main new coronavirus strain in the world, outbreaks have been reported in dozens of countries, including South Africa, where the pandemic has been centered.
According to health officials, the number of new cases in Huntingdon increased by 400% in the first week of December, and tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were variants of Opmire.

Educational commentary: What should we do to save the children who have been abducted?
If compared with the famous publicity slogan "Without trade, there is no killing," then in a good environment where there is no demand for "trafficking in children", the prevention and control of crime by the whole community and the whole people will make it unprofitable, risky and costly for such crimes to occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency release platform for missing children.
This is an Internet information platform established to establish an authority channel for the release of information on missing children and to find missing children in a timely manner.
After hearing the name of the App is "Union," I felt a lot of warmth.
The new technology and means not only have the name "artistic" and full of emotion, but also are well used and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement against child trafficking is to find the children who have been trafficked and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
However, before the case is solved, it is necessary to focus on the safety of the victim.
Things are of different degrees of urgency, and under the urgent purpose of "search and rescue", such as the topic of "whether child trafficking should be sentenced to death", which is controversial and has been debated for a long time, it can be put aside for careful discussion; but the rescue of the trafficked children is not allowed.
According to the experience of the investigation of such cases, the traffickers are apt to move away from the scene of the crime as soon as possible after the accomplishment of the crime.
If the search is delayed for one minute, the child may be further away from the parent. The difficulty of the case investigation will increase by one point.
In this case, it is a practical action to take a direct effective way such as the "Union" platform to help solve the case and find the child.
In the end, it is a big task to carry out the operation of the whole legal system to do a good job in the fight against child trafficking.
The fight against crime, the protection of the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the guarantee of judicial protection and the careful implementation of law enforcement, all require the implementation of the care of children and weak people.
In addition, the prevention of the trafficking of children can be done better from the family to the society.
For example, a common case is that a family of three is resting at the station, the parents are asleep, and they wake up to find that their child has disappeared.
You can't expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent, you should at least have a certain level of protection awareness.
It is the minimum means to prevent children being abducted.
From the other side of the police's fight against trafficking in crime, the buyer of the trafficked child should also be given attention and punished.
The single illegal act often is only one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of my country's Criminal Law, the minimum penalty for the crime of trafficking in children is 5 years. If the crime is particularly serious, the penalty can be to death, and the property can be confiscated.
The penalty point is high and the maximum penalty is heavy. Under the trend of "light punishment", the crime of trafficking in children is obviously a crime with a heavy penalty.
There are still many cases of trafficking in human beings every year.
It can be seen that some people have an outdated concept of raising children and a lack of legal awareness.
The legal education for this group of people should be synchronized.
It is not enough to strictly enforce the law by the authorities.
If the "market" for trafficking children exists widely, the traffickers are greedy and constantly innovate the means of trafficking children, forming a situation of "fighting with law enforcement" with law enforcement officers, and the trafficking operation will inevitably fall into a low-performing muddle.
Therefore, the eradication of backward ideas, the popularization of legal knowledge, and the rooting out of the crime of trafficking and buying children also help to cure the crime.
Yang Hongdong preached the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress and the 6th Central Committee of the Provincial Party Committee at Macao
From the history of the party’s 100 years of struggle, take the strength of struggle
Hunan Daily (all media reporter Gong Boxwei) on October 12 (full media reporter) According to the unified arrangement of the provincial party committee, Mr. Yang Hongdong, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, gave an interactive lecture in the video creative park of Gulangshan in the morning of October 10. He studied and implemented the spirit of the sixth session of the 19th CPC National Congress, studied and implemented the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech and instructions to Hunan Province, studied and implemented the spirit of the 12th CPC National Congress of the province, and so on.
Yang Hongdong, from the three aspects of Ideal Beliefs and the First Commitment, Self-Rebelion and the Youth Grand Party, Party Leaders and Party Theory, combined with his own insight and personal experience, explained the core meaning and practice requirements of the full meeting in a concise and systematic manner.
He pointed out that it is necessary to combine the spirit of the full meeting with the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech to Hunan and the spirit of the Party Congress of the province, integrate and integrate the spirit, strengthen the ideological self-awareness, political self-awareness and action self-awareness of defending "the two established" and achieving "the two safeguards", and firmly move forward in line with General Secretary Xi Jinping's guidance.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil. There are five grades.
First pressing olive oil is also known as natural olive oil, which is obtained after removing impurities such as foreign objects by mechanical cold pressing, filtration and other processing.
It is divided into three levels according to the different pH:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: is the highest grade and quality of olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a pleasant fragrance of plants, and the acidity is not more than 1%.
Premium extra virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): The acidity is slightly higher, but not more than 2%, and the taste is pure and fragrant.
Regular virgin olive oil (ordinary virgin olive oil): The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity is not more than 3.3%.
The refined olive oil refers to the refined olive oil after the acidity exceeds 3.3%.
The refined olive oil is divided into two levels:
Regular olive oil (Olive Oil): refined olive oil and a certain proportion of virgin olive oil are mixed to balance the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5% and a transparent golden yellow color.
Refined olive oil or olive pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): Olive oil obtained by dissolving the pomace oil and refining it.
You should have already noticed that the acidity of olive oil is an important indicator.
You should know that olives are like grapes when it comes to making wine. Olives from different regions and varieties of olives will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best growing place of olive:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for growing olive trees.
In addition to the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be planted sparingly in the suitable area.
Major production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, as well as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa, which are similar to the climate, are located far south of the equator.
The olive harvest month:
In the period of March to June every year, the time of olive tree flowering and fruiting is, and in the period of July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, and the fruit changes from green to red, purple, and finally black.
From November to February next year is the harvest season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
The nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, including oleic acid and linoleic acid, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the best oil for human nutrition to date.
The Democratic Summit ended, Biden said the flame of freedom would never be extinguished
The online "Democracy Summit" convened by President Joe Biden and attended by governments and leaders of civil society and the private sector from 110 countries around the world closed on Friday (December 10).
In his closing speech, Biden said that the flame of freedom was burning in the hearts of everyone in the world, and the tyranny regime could never extinguish it.
He also said that the second global "Democracy Summit" will be held next year.
Taiwan government representative and政务委员唐凤 and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Qianxun also spoke at the meeting on the second day.
Biden said: "We know the work before us is so difficult.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere.
The dictatorship will never extinguish the flame of freedom, which is burning in people's hearts all over the world and all over the world. "
Biden also said that it is necessary for the whole society to work together to defend democracy.
He said, "As the leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent accountability governance, and be able to resist the strength of the buffer and impact of the authoritarianism and those who want to pursue power in front of the public interest. "
The second theme of the "Democratic Summit" was to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and resist authoritarianism, and to counteract digital authoritarianism and affirm the value of democracy.
This day coincides with the International Human Rights Day.
In his opening speech on the same day, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Guterres, also said that the cause of democracy faced challenges all over the world, especially the challenges brought by new digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions and the resilience of democracy.
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving the inequality problem, fighting corruption, updating the social contract, investing in high-quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technology revolution. "
Through a pre-recorded video, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Luo Qianxun delivered a speech to the summit, reminding the participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and other Chinese minority groups such as Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said, "for a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Ruan Yiqing also called on the free world to unite against the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "Maybe some of you are afraid to offend General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't realize (the Communist Party) is threatening our democratic values.
This is the cause of our failure.
This is also the reason we must change. "
In the video release of the "National Statement" at the Round Table Discussion on "Deterring Digital Dictatorship and Appreciating the Value of Democracy", Taiwan's Secretary of the Executive Yuan Feng released the "National Statement", emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of resisting tyranny and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience in combating the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said, "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism in the world and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the pandemic, various authoritarian governments around the world have rationalized human rights violations on the pretext of public health and collective interests. Global democracy has shown a backward trend.
However, in Taiwan, we do not need to close the city to control the epidemic, and we do not need to remove the fake information to defeat it. "
At the same time as the second day of the "Democracy Summit", the U.S. Treasury announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea, and several other countries, as well as on a Chinese company that was identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Why not cancel
Hello, the chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I am afraid that I cannot keep up, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often related to the friendliness, if not, the expensive normal situation is more friendly than the cheap one, which is actually industrial waste.
They are very weak, the ball hits the top of the bat, the vibration is very great, and the hard ball cannot withstand it. High-level players are very difficult to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, and you know you can't afford to buy the expensive one, so you make a cheap one to trick you. You play it twice, and you won't play it again. So this racket is cheap, and you don't care.
When you can really distinguish the good and bad, it means that you have progressed, and then come here to buy the expensive, I will earn twice the money.
It is suggested to buy a second-hand good one at a similar price. Choose the Prince or Dunlop brand. These two brands are not famous enough, so a good one will not be sold at a high price. A new one costs 500 or 600 yuan, and a second-hand one costs 200 yuan. Isn't it nice to have a thousand yuan one?
It is friendly to beginners, but it is useless after the beginner stage. Most people, especially girls, cannot pass the beginner stage.
Orders have repeatedly delayed delivery time
Could you help me follow up?

So, in fact, I have credit?
Do I need to make a new order? Didn't that order need to be ignored?

In fact, there are many things to consider when dressing for a thin girl.
Girls who are fat should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length should be about knee-length, which is just enough to cover the fat on the thigh.
If the skirt is too short, the leg fat will be exposed.
The longer it is, it will make people feel short and fat.
If you wear it in three parts, it will make you naturally taller, so the colors of the upper body, skirt and stockings are different, it will look like a graceful feeling.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard of thin girls (which the author fully understands), and dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat. The elegant black skirt is also the first choice of thin girls.
Putting on dark clothes, especially black skirts, will make you feel slimmer.
If your legs are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too much.
It should be more popular, and the color should not be too bright.
To prevent people from paying attention to your legs and feet when you are obese.
For the slightly overweight girl, it is necessary to tell her the secret of dressing and matching.
Girls with a small waist should not wear tight skirts, and the tops should not be too short or stuck in the skirt. This will make people feel uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black socks or mesh socks (not the fine mesh socks). Choose soft print peplum skirts, and match a button-up shirt with it. This will cover the girl's shortcomings.
Of course, there are also some rules for wearing a short skirt for a thin girl.
Girls who are fat should wear a skirt with the same color as the skirt. This will make your fat body look taller.
Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs appear longer, which is the most IN summer outfit!
If you are a person who is fat on the top but has a thin leg, you should choose a beautifully styled skirt.
It can not only hide the belly, but also show your advantages.
The A-line skirt will make you look slimmer, which is better for girls who are fat. The top should be tightened to form a layer, which will make you look slimmer.
With a simple white T-shirt and a short skirt, the fat girl can also try it.
The thin girl can also wear fashionable clothes.
If you can master the rules of dressing, then the thin girls will also be the focus of attention.
After the change of dressing style, it is also necessary to exercise more in life, so that we can get rid of the label of a little fat girl as soon as possible😄

The girl was the target for her sister to raise money: "When I think of it, it doesn't hurt much" - Xinhua
The girl stood in front of a big wooden board with the words "Man meat target, 10 yuan shot" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a picture of a girl from Hangzhou who was willing to be an "arrow target" for her sister to raise money went viral on WeChat.
The picture shows that a girl stands at the front of a large wooden board in Yiyang Square, Hangzhou, with the words "Man meat target, 10 yuan shot" written on it, indicating that people can shoot arrows after paying.
The behavior caused a lot of discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity manager of the Police Department of the City of Hangzhou confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police had made such a drastic action after confirming that the girl was a sister who had donated money. However, this action was not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girls on the street “targeted” for charity
In the picture leaked online, a girl with long hair stands in the shape of a “person” in front of a large wooden board, with the words “human target, 10 yuan per arrow” written on the wooden board, and her bank account and WeChat and Alipay account written on the other wooden board in front of her.
The picture went viral after it was posted online.
Some netizens believed that this was a "scam to attract attention", while many netizens expressed sympathy for this.
We found the situation at around 10 a.m. on the morning of the 23rd when the crowd was already quite large.
When interviewed by local media, a police officer at天水派出所 near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls who were selling on the street, both of whom were young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who was made a "human target" was crying and begging the passerby to play the game; another girl was at the side yelling and saying that her friend's sister had been diagnosed with leukemia and needed surgery, so please help.
We contacted the local police in贵州 and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the publicity manager of the Police Department of the City of Hangzhou told the reporter of Xinhua News Agency that the girl's name was Jijali, and she was collecting donations for her sister Jijali.
However, because the treatment still needs more than 30,000 yuan, they did not think of a good way to raise funds at first.
He said that during the whole process, the two girls were both the target and the assistant, but they did not participate in the process. No one shot arrows during the whole process, but someone took pictures and posted them on Twitter.
After the police used the bow and arrow, it was not within the scope of the regulation.
The person in charge said that "it is not recommended to adopt this eye-catching fundraising method."
After being warned by the police station, she has left the police station.

What is the most popular in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win the medal?
There was a very popular article in the past called "Quick Look! Olympic Games for Project Managers", which mentioned that project managers can take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: Construction, travel and oversleeping are the daily routine of project managers, and firefighting, blaming and apologizing are no longer necessary.
The article seems to be a joke, but it also reveals the daily hardships of project managers, behind which is the inability to perform current project management work.
And those who are responsible for project management are gradually choosing some actions to get rid of their difficulties in work.
From the increasing number of PMP (Project Management Professional) applicants each year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills by learning.
According to the "Report on the Development of Project Management in China (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants had reached nearly 60,000, and the number of PMP® certified persons had reached nearly 42,000, while the number of effective PMP® certified persons had reached nearly 30,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certified persons worldwide.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer advisable to do things by simply copying the “old experience”. The rapidly changing work environment has made us know that we should learn to stand on the shoulders of giants to explore the way forward.
However, can PMP guarantee the smooth operation of project management?
Many project management beginners said that by learning the related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the knowledge points of the 10 major areas and the 5 major process groups of project management, but when they actually do the project management, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following questions: Project management knowledge is inadequate, relying on personal experience, only having project management theories, and do not know how to practice; lack of a systematic project management process system support, cannot be implemented in the work, project estimates are inaccurate, the controllability and sensitivities are poor, and the project is dragged for a long time; members are not clearly divided, and the "old man" in the team does not know how to deal with; communication between departments is not smooth, and the project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than 10 years, it has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R&D talents, and has won the honorary title of "China's R&D management talent training demonstration base" and so on.
The online course "Specialized Training for Project Manager" This is a way of online fragmented learning. It combines the practical cases and tools and methods of many R&D enterprises, helping you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and take the next step in your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training of project managers at a lower cost and with less investment, and to bring about more efficient operation results for enterprises.
Without evidence, you can first see how other students evaluate this course: This course is not only taught by the China Media Group (CMG) China Media Group (CMG) China Media Group China Media Group China Media Group (CMG) China Media Group CMG (CMG) China Media Group (CMG) CMG (CMG) CMG (CMG) China Media Group China Media Group (CMG) CMG China Media Group (CMG) CMG China Media (CMG) China Media (CMG) CMG CMG CMG CMG (CMG) CMG CMG CMG (CMG) China Media (CMG) China Media (CMG) (CMG) China Media (CMG) CMG China Media (CMG) (CMG) CMG CMG CMG CMG CMG CMG (CMG) (CMG) (CMG) (CMG) (CMG) China Media (CMG) (CMG) (CMG) CMG CMG (CMG) (CMG) CMG CMG China Media (CMG) (CMG) (CMG).

Jicai advocates rational consumption for consumers ahead of the "12th" - economic news website
This year's "Double 11" festival saw the total transaction amount of online payment business across the country reach 17.77 trillion yuan, a new high compared with previous years.
In addition to the variety of discount coupons, the lively live shopping broadcast has once again captured consumers' attention, which has benefited consumers greatly. On the one hand, the consumer boom has made people wonder whether the national consumer power is becoming stronger, but on the other hand, it has also forced people to think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
At the eve of the “Double 12”, Jicai Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Jicai”) issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the vast number of users, especially young people, to establish a good awareness of consumption and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 from 2019.
Overall, the performance of Chinese residents on the financial consumption level is better, but there are still large differences in financial behavior and skills. It is necessary to further improve the basic financial knowledge level.
The level of financial literacy of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and the focus of financial education will continue to be on the “old and young” group; Nielsen’s “China Young People’s Debt Situation Report” and CCTV Finance’s “2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report” show that the young generation has great potential for consumption, credit consumption has become an important means of consumption upgrading, and 86.6% of the young people are using credit products. Nearly half of the young people have no debt accumulation. Although the young generation shows a trend of rational consumption, it is vastly different from the label of “over-spending” put on the outside world. However, some young people do have over-spending behavior and follow the trend of others. This has resulted in a large financial pressure and debt risk, even causing social problems to gradually increase. Financial enterprises should take on social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Everbright has always been committed to helping consumers build their own happy life with high-quality and attentive service. It advocates consumers to establish a good and correct consumption attitude and actively responds to the call of supervision to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people.
In the past few years, Everbright has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, through various forms such as launching innovative practice competitions with domestic top universities, and has helped to guide the consumption needs of young people in a rational manner, help them plan their consumption needs rationally, and help them accumulate life wealth.
On the eve of the Double 12, Jing信 reminds all consumers friends to set up a reasonable consumption awareness and a correct monetary outlook, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid the consumption-credit trap, and avoid affecting their personal credit rating and the future economic life.
When you spend, you should plan ahead and be responsible.
If the payment is late, the late payment record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the purchase of cars and other economic life.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, we should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions are qualified to operate.
In the future, Zhe信 will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously updated and improved financial products to provide consumers with more customized and diverse services that meet their needs. It will continuously help consumers improve their financial knowledge level and help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderately borrowing, and become a trusted consumer finance partner for consumers for life.

Vietnamese People's Daily - Gulf Cooperation Council should face common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stopover includes Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first time that Crown Prince Mohammed visited Qatar since the Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in 2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive blockade on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
The diplomatic tension seriously affected the internal unity of the Hashemite Kingdom and had a negative impact on the economy of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the routes to Qatar by land, sea and air.
The crisis was resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, and the countries of the Gulf signed an agreement to move towards "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened the border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are trying to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to the two countries in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab countries have resolved differences to restore relations with Qatar on the basis of the need to unite for the interests of all countries and regional stability.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct road link between the two neighboring countries in the Gulf.
The long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for citizens of the two countries to travel and integrate the supply chain.
Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest US$50 billion in Oman, and two countries' enterprises signed 13 memorandums of cooperation worth US$300 billion.
Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincided with negotiations between Iran and major world powers on a nuclear agreement called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was condemned by the Gulf countries because they believed it could not be resolved.
All the Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and regarded Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The countries in the Gulf believe that the absence of a solution to the Iranian missile problem and the absence of action to curb Iran's activities in the region are deficient.
Under the background that the nuclear negotiations between major countries and Iran failed to meet the wishes of the countries in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted direct negotiations.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that slow down the growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first Gulf Cooperation Council summit since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-examine the diplomatic achievements that contributed to the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and put forward various measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate with each other to meet the common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Said to be the loudest exhaust sound of the new mountain super car!
This car brought by our team is the dream of many men!
It is the Lamborghini's flagship super car, Murcielago's successor model - Aventador LP700-4!
The price is nearly two million Malaysian dollars, and the road tax is nearly 10,000 Malaysian dollars a year. It is a four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Because you have 700 horsepower, how fast can you imagine?
That's OK, I don't know. According to the data, the acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h takes just 2.9 seconds, which is about when myvi reached 30 km/h.
The low, bulky body, the raucous knife-edge door, and the huge intake around the car's perimeter are all perfect representations of Lamborghini's style.
For the price of the car, you don't need to say too much, you can Google it yourself, and I have collected some Google may not give you the explanation!
It was too much attention, so everyone was watching, which was uncomfortable!
The cost of 1km of oil is about RM1 (the owner doesn't care)
Practice the position of getting on and off the car, otherwise it will be a little embarrassing (because it won't be able to get out of the car and get stuck in the middle)
The engine sound was too loud, so I suddenly lost my hearing after getting off the car. (But it was still very enjoyable)
The car is too big, so it will be very narrow to park in a normal parking space. I am afraid it will be hit by the neighbor's car when it opens the door!
I'm a little lonely because there are no competitors on the road.
Don't misunderstand, the super car in this video is not for sale. Sorry!
If you want to take a video for your car, please contact us!
More information about cars you may not know is in The Car Guide / People's Auto Journal
It involved a car accident worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are well-known to car lovers, Chiron is one of the most expensive super cars in the world, and Porsche 911 is also worth millions!
Just a few minutes ago, foreign cars crashed the Porsche 911 and the Lamborghini Chiron in a flash!
The result is reasonable!
Let the university spirit resonate with the current spirit of the times - Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and values that a university has accumulated over time during its development, and is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit is of utmost importance for the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, as well as the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the first modern university in the world, the university has assumed a unique mission that is different from that of other social organizations. For my country's universities, the spirit is deeply influenced by the traditional culture and the changes of times. The value concept and the patriotism of promoting the study of the country are advocated.
At present, the trend of higher education informationization and internationalization is increasingly obvious, and the global education competition, scientific and technological competition and talent competition are constantly intensified. As an important “supply side” of higher education, its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
Especially the proposal of the "Overall Plan for统筹推进世界一流大学和一流学科建设", which shows the confidence and determination of my country to move from a large country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, is also a higher requirement for university development.
How can we work hard to reach the top of the world in a short time, accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines, and achieve the “overtake the curve”?
In addition to firm goals, confidence in the path, and confidence in the ability, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: one is the later advantage, through continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, and realizing a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; the other is the cultural advantage, inherited the wisdom of the Chinese civilization for 5000 years, and promoted the development of excellent traditional Chinese culture, so as to gather strength, build a brand, and enhance the image; the third is the advantage of the system, play the superiority of socialism in a socialist country, strengthen the drive of the goal, gather consensus strength, optimize resource allocation, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for the acceleration of the school to catch up with the world's advanced level.
Especially, we should realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university in a uniform way. At the same time, schools must show their individuality and characteristics while playing their strengths.
The educational characteristics should have both common Chinese characteristics and unique target positioning and educational traditions and resources.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we attach importance to highlighting the three aspects of characteristics in our operation: one is to highlight the innovation and entrepreneurship talent training characteristics, build an integrated education environment of science and education, and form a full chain of entrepreneurship education ecosystem; the other is to highlight the characteristics of cross-disciplinary convergence and promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create a system environment of cross-disciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate emerging cross-disciplinary disciplines and landmark cross-disciplinary results; the third is to highlight the characteristics of the educational system and social service and carry out in-depth international exchange cooperation, accelerate the formation of the production and research cooperation system of Zhejiang University.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the "求是创新" school motto, the "勤学、修德、明辨、笃实" shared values and the " <v>Haining</v> Haining</v> Haining Haining" shared values and the " Haining Haining Haining Haining" shared values and the "Haining Haining Haining" shared values and the "Haining" shared values and the " Haining" shared values and the "Haining" share values and the "Haining" share values and the " Haining" share values and the "Haining" share values" shared values and the " Haining Haining Haining" share values and the " Haining Haining Haining" shared values and the " Haining" share values and the " Haining" shared values" shared values and the " Haining Haining" share values" shared values and the " Haining" share values" shared values and the " shared values and the " shared values and the "shared values and the "shared values and the " shared values and the" shared values and the" shared values and the " shared values and the" share values and the " share values and the" share values and the" share values and the
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct educational direction and continuously accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual strength. The connotation is rich and the significance is profound.
Among them, "Henan River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflects the spirit of "using talent from all over the world", and manifests the high-quality concept of education and training of world-renowned universities; "True and Hard Heart" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth to the best, which means that the university should not only pursue truth, but also accept the cultivation of virtue and personality during the pursuit of truth; "Opening up the world before the people" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes seeking new knowledge, scientific innovation, and reforming and developing; and "planting my country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotic dedication, which means that the university should always work together with the national destiny.
This series of spiritual ideas and values pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year education.
"Smart people listen to the silent, and wise people see the invisible."
China's colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, grasp the current situation and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of becoming a world-class university.
At the same time, we should adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, let the university spirit and the time spirit and the national spirit meet and interact, so as to provide endless energy for realizing the national prosperity and the rejuvenation of the nation, and realizing the common ideal of mankind.
There were two wrong things in the package.

At the speed of NFT, a new concept emerged in the cryptocurrency community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic began to receive stable income in this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet cultivation game based on blockchain technology. It integrates a variety of gameplay modes, including NFT, and is currently the highest trading volume NFT project. As of now, it has exceeded US$30 million.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily income exceeded US$20.2 million, which is close to the income of "Super League".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity said that its daily active users had exceeded 100,000.
The fever of the game "Axie Infinity" will transmit a new "palytoearn" mode to more people, and through blockchain and smart contract help, players will no longer be a single character, but can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game maker, but by the blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about the stock price of a friend, my biggest impression is that the enterprise should choose the industry on the road, that is, the investment target industry, first of all, choose the industry with a large growth space, at least 100 billion market scale; second, choose the industry with a good growth prospect in the future, and consider the industry with the best growth prospect in the next three to five years; finally, choose the industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market scale, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, the flatness of the track refers to the competition pattern of the industry.
加油 to the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the 2021 adjustment of the 2022 tactical layout.
The key is to "do the things right", which is to do things correctly.
The strategy is to "do the right thing", which is to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find the direction, and the tactics are to land. There is a space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), how to continue deepening in the current field (strategic thinking), how to increase the customer retention rate (tactical thinking), how to increase the customer retention rate of core customers and high-value customers; how to improve the participation rate of activities (tactical thinking), how to set up correct activity KPI to achieve correct activity goals, such as improving the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and precisely attracting new customers; how to improve the DAU (tactical thinking), and whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
After 12 years of birth, Bitcoin will celebrate several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador will adopt Bitcoin as a legal currency, which is the first time that Bitcoin has become a legal currency in a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years, and it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), marking the expansion of the cryptocurrency investment gap again.

Asian-American groups complain of discrimination at 3 Ivy League universities - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) - More than 130 Asian groups in the United States filed an appeal to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd to protest the discrimination of three Ivy League universities - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College in the process of recruiting students.
The Asian Education Alliance, which led the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The chairman of the group, Zhao Yu空, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the requirements of American universities has grown exponentially in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian applicants in these three American universities has basically remained the same.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities have discriminated against Asian students in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" admission process, discriminating against Asian students for a long time and systematically.
Zhao Yu空 said that the study by scholars such as Sanders in 2014 showed that among the three universities, the Asian enrollment rate was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
U.S. Department of Education data also shows that among all Ivy League universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have actually enforced racial quotas for Asian students for more than two decades.
Zhao Yu空 told the reporter of Xinhua News Agency that they expected the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice to carry out investigations and take measures to stop these colleges and universities from discriminating against Asian students after the submission of the appeal.
They also expect the schools to take the initiative to address the issue and change their admissions policies for Asian students.
At present, the three colleges and universities have not responded to the complaint.
The Asian Education Alliance was established in 2015, when it had complained about Harvard University's discrimination in admissions. However, the US Department of Education rejected the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to the American Chinese groups participating in the appeal, there are also American Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a real estate agent that a factory was located in Yuyuan Qiantu Town, Zhejiang Province. After several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In the same month of December, Mr. Lu consulted with the family member of the property owner, Lin, and transferred 20,000 yuan by bank transfer on the same day as a deposit.
Mr. Lin signed the "Bill of Deposit" on the "Bill of Deposit", which stated that "If the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be doubled returned to the seller. The two sides agreed to sign the factory purchase contract within a week."
However, after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on major contract terms such as the range of the factory sale and payment methods, the house sale contract was still not signed.
Considering that the two sides could not reach an agreement on the content of the contract, Mr. Lin returned the 20,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
It took a lot of effort to find the house, and the deposit was paid, but the seller refused to sell. Mr. Lu was frustrated and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yanyuan Municipal People's Court.
After the trial, the court concluded that the two sides finally failed to sign a formal contract, which cannot be solely attributed to the defendant, and should be reasonably presumed to have failed to reach an agreement, so this case should not be subject to the deposit penalty. The defendant should not bear the double return of the deposit penalty.
After the verdict, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the second trial court maintained the original verdict.
The lawyer reminds that in the course of the transaction, it is necessary to perform the necessary cautionary duty.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, you should perform the necessary cautionary duty, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the house is occupied, and so on, and clarify in the contract the specific time and place of delivery to prevent disputes during the performance of the contract.
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman on Saturday (12 November) said that the United States hosted a "leadership summit for the people" as a "line of ideology" to "instrumentalize democracy and weaponize it, under the guise of democracy but in reality to oppose democracy, to foment division and confrontation, and to transfer domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on people and carried out 'democratic reform', imposed unilateral sanctions and instigated a 'color revolution', resulting in devastating consequences.
"Democracy" has become a "major weapon of mass destruction" for the US to intervene in other countries.
This summit is an action by Biden to fulfill his election promise.
The two-day meeting was held in video format, and leaders from 111 countries, including Taiwan's leaders, were invited to attend. However, China and Russia were not invited.
At the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democracy, saying that the United States had no right to hold the summit.
There are also voices of doubt in the international community and the United States. For example, some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as leaders in the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, have been criticized for being invited to the meeting. Some people doubt that the true intention of the Biden administration is not to organize the meeting for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
German Prime Minister Schroeder also participated in the video democracy summit
In a statement on Saturday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China said, " Today's American democracy is in a state of madness, and the problems of money politics, identity politics, party rivalry, political polarization, social division, ethnic conflict, and income disparity are intensifying." The American democracy is based on the "rich people's game".
In his speech, the President of the United States, Joe Biden, said, "As the leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent accountability governance, and be able to resist the strength of the buffer and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who want to pursue power in front of the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not a given, "we must constantly renew it in each generation, and in my opinion, this is a decisive challenge in this era."
Biden also said that democracy and human rights in the world "face continuing and worrying challenges, and democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The U.S. side promised to launch an action lasting one year, including an initiative worth $4.244 billion to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries make concrete public commitments before the planned real democracy summit at the end of 2022 to improve their democratic system.
Biden said, "Let us implement our commitments to all countries and report our progress next year."
Okay, I am afraid that he has mistaken the address.
Japanese Restaurant (Fifth Gate Store)
[薄荷] environment: standard and standard [serving bell] service: the food is served quickly "The traditional马拉糕" is my must-try dish. The马拉糕 is so sweet, so soft and so good.

What is the drinking method of red liquor?
Everyone has different hobbies, some like collecting, some like eating, and so on. Red Label Whiskey is one of the most popular Scotch whiskies in all countries, and Red Label Whiskey has won the gold medal at the International Spirits Competition.
Each bottle of red label whiskey has its unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, it would be a waste of its sweetness.
How to drink red liquor?
Here is a brief introduction for you.
Red Label Whisky Drinking:
Guinness Red Label Whiskey is made from about 35 types of Scotch Whiskey and has a rich aroma and characteristics of traditional Scotch Whiskey. The aroma is rich, sweet and smoky.
The entrance is rich and fresh, with a hint of vanilla and strong smoke flavor.
The wine can be drunk directly with ice or mixed with the favorite drink.
Red Label Whiskey entered the domestic market to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, and Red Label Whiskey + Coke or Sprite or New Coke became a fashionable drink.
These sweet drinks can not only neutralize the sour taste, but also make people feel happy in the visual sense. Add drinks to dilute the wine taste and change the taste.
Red label whiskey + sliced lemon + sugar (sugar can also be used), is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The authentic red box wine has an acidic taste, which can be neutralized by sugar. Lemon will bring a refreshing aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to individual tastes and preferences.
The above three are the best drinking methods of red whiskey. You can try them as references and hope that my introduction will help you.
Educational thought: How to make the "good student" and the "poor student" get what they deserve at the university examination - Xinhua
Three students from兰州交通大学 wrote to the university leaders to express their confusion about the university examination and proposed to increase the difficulty of the examination, change the examination format and make the examination truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, for a long time, university examination has been a "hot" topic.
In the university campus, students come from all over the country, and their ability level is different, and their learning situation is different.
For a group with such diversified characteristics, there are different feelings, which is inevitable.
Of course, if the test questions are of a single type and the repetition rate is high, the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause a completely different feeling.
Students who are not diligent may be able to pass the examination by concentrating on the examination before the examination. If there is another way, it may achieve a better effect.
As a result, there is a "怪 situation" that a student can pass the examination even if he or she is not invested in the examination. A student can also get a high score even if he or she is not invested in the examination, and there is no "怪 situation" that a student can get a high score even if he or she is invested in the examination.
So it seems that the students of兰州交通大学 have expressed their dissatisfaction with the problems in the university examination. It is believed that this situation is not just in兰州交通大学.
From this point of view, I would like to thank these three students for being frank in writing.
In fact, everyone who has gone to college knows that the phenomenon of preparing for the exam in an emergency, thinking of various ways to "borrow" the exam from the teacher, and striving to cover the examination scope in order to get "special tutoring" before the exam and ask the teacher for mercy after the exam is not rare.
In my opinion, as a quality evaluation guide, it is more important for a university to measure the passing rate of the examination based on the comprehensive understanding of teaching and learning by teachers and scientific命题 on the basis of this.
When entering the college level, the professional began to be divided, and many professional courses were based on basic knowledge.
Without doubt, whether to fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content of the university examination.
And the basic knowledge of undergraduate courses is the basic theory and basic knowledge of the discipline. From the point of view of knowledge points, the change is not great, and it is basically fixed.
Just as a teacher said, "basics of university mathematics learned 20 years ago are still being learned, and they are still the focus."
But the basic knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test question type is single and the test question is repeated.
In many colleges and universities, the examination is usually organized into a question group, and then organized into a test paper by the senior teacher in the discipline. The examination of the test paper is also carried out by all teachers in the discipline, so as to overcome the repetition of the test.
However, to formulate a set of practical tests that are in line with the teaching and learning situation, the difficulty of the test is distributed in a normal distribution, and it is also necessary to comprehensively master the teaching situation, comprehensively analyze the degree of student learning, and thus the test can have dynamic grasp of difficulty and test type, so as to highlight the examination of basic knowledge and to balance the examination of ability, at the same time, the test can be innovatively designed.
The examination is the key to university education. What kind of examination a student has, he will have a corresponding preparation plan, which will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the student's suggestion letter, the兰州交通大学 school has attached great importance to it and has deployed a plan to rectify it in the whole school.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out discussions and final examinations, and compare self-examinations with each other, set up examination papers and related systems, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination papers and the examination process. Fine the grading and strengthen the comprehensive evaluation of the course teaching.
Solving the problem of the single type of test and the repetition of the same question is an issue that the university examination authorities need to face. Of course, there needs to be a corresponding system in place, but the key is to master the teaching situation on a daily basis. Teachers need to master the teaching content as well as the student's learning situation. Master the two at the same time, and the teaching and learning will be better connected, forming a positive interaction, and the examination will also be more realistic, so that the "top student" and the "poor student" can get what they need.

Kim's Bridal Photography (South Street Store) Has No分店
We changed the time twice before taking the photo, and the consultant, Lan Lan, was very patient and helped us arrange the time.
He then chose a good weather weekend to shoot.
The staff of the Queen’s staff, whether it is an advisor, a makeup artist or a photographer, is excellent.
That was my first time to make up in a formal way, wow, I can't believe that I will look so good one day, hahaha.
Xiao洁 and another girl (sorry, I can't remember the name) are very patient in makeup and makeup is very natural.
The scene was filmed in the city of Jiang Bay, which was lucky that the weather was good that day, so we did not feel very cold when we took photos, and the makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes, headpieces, and if something was not right, he would help us immediately.
The photographer was very humorous, and he felt happy all day long.
When we chose the photos, because we saw many cases online, we didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we chose the photos, we really didn't mean to add photos, just the 24 photos in the direct package, none of which were added (I heard that my cousin who took a wedding photo at the same time as me added more than 10,000 photos to the package, and I was shocked at that time and also afraid that I would add too many photos)
Today the photo was fixed, and Lan Lan sent it to me. I looked at two of them and they immediately helped me to fix them.
Comparing the photos of my sister before, I think our photos are really satisfied, simple and fresh, which is what I wanted.
I sincerely recommend that you go to Zhanghan Golden Lady to take a wedding photo!
Package price: 3999 yuan
The Queen is grateful for your sincere wishes for her happiness and success.

Sabah's 3,200 newborn babies have no birth paper due to shortage of customized anti-counterfeit paper
(Abi 11) The National Registration Bureau of Sabah said that due to the depletion of special anti-counterfeit paper stock, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October. Up to 3,200 people have been affected so far.
However, the Director of the Bureau, Kaloushmius, assured that all the babies who have applied for the birth paper have been recorded in the system and that the birth paper will be issued to them when the anti-counterfeit paper arrives next week.
At the press conference, he gave an explanation for the 10-month-long report on the printing of Sarawak's daily paper by a website media.
He said the issue had been raised two months ago and the state was also facing the same problem.
One reason is that the Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeit paper have been affected by the epidemic, which has delayed the arrival of the paper in my country.
He explained that the anti-piracy paper used in Sabah's birth certificates is different from that in other states, so it cannot be borrowed from other states.
The latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on June 6 and was handed over to the printing company on August 8 for partial printing.
The agency will send a team to collect the goods in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday and return to Sabah immediately for the final printing, which is estimated to take more than two working days (December 20). "
We will notify the applicant to go to the local branch office to collect the application paper. "
He added that so far this year, Sabah has issued a total of 2,484 birth certificates.
From 7 o'clock to now
Is that it?
I mean food
I waited in front of #PRS_ORG# again
Okay, thank you, because the restaurant said it was ready.

Bosnian Olympic Committee President: Believes that China is capable of organizing the Winter Olympics in a special time - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Sarajevo, December 11 -- The president of the Bosnian Olympic Committee, Covic, said recently that the Bosnian side was very eager to host the Beijing Winter Olympics and believed that China was capable of hosting the Winter Olympics in a special period.
Yiping, the Chinese ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, met with the president of the Bosnian Olympic Committee, Covic, at the Olympic Center in Sarajevo.
At the meeting, Kwasniewski actively evaluated the relations between China and Poland and said that he had visited China at the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008 and had been impressed by the excellent organization work of China. He believed that China could successfully hold the Winter Olympics at a special time. The Polish Olympic Committee was actively organizing for the meeting. The Polish side hoped that this would be a good opportunity to carry out more extensive exchanges and cooperation in the field of sports with China.
Qi Ping said that China and Poland have a special " Olympic bond".
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics successfully held here, and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also begin in two months. This will present a simple, safe and wonderful celebration to the world.
We look forward to further deepening exchanges and cooperation in preparation for winter sports events and training of athletes between the two countries. The Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play a bridging role, taking the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity, and promote the further deepening of cultural exchanges between the two countries, so that the people of the two countries can “look forward to the future together”, and wish the athletes of Bosnia and Herzegovina good luck in Beijing.
Before the meeting, the Bosnian Olympic Committee held a "Annual Best Athlete" Award Ceremony to award the Best Young Athlete of Bosnia and Herzegovina as an invited guest.
The video of the Beijing Winter Olympics was played at the site of the event.

The State Council has issued a letter on strengthening the prevention and control of epidemic outbreaks at ports and cities, requiring the establishment of a buffer zone within 48 hours and strengthening the prevention and control of epidemic outbreaks in ports and cities- Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporter Ding Ruifeng and Qi Tiancheng) The State Council has recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in frontier cities, requiring that people who have left land border frontier cities (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) within the past 48 hours should have a negative result of the nucleic acid test within 48 hours, and that people who have arrived at land border frontier cities should have at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notification, the time range of the above requirements is from the determination of the border cities of the provinces and cities and the announcement to the date of March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notification also proposed that border cities with conditions can study the establishment of epidemic prevention buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
The person in charge of the Department of Disease Prevention and Control of the State Council said that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy. The two sides of the border people exchange frequently.
By implementing a differentiated management policy for different regions, from one barrier to two barriers, it is expected to move the frontier and reduce the risk of outbreaks, and to achieve the greatest effectiveness of epidemic prevention with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local cluster outbreaks in China, all of which have been imported from abroad through border cities.
The above notifications pointed out that this exposed some problems such as the failure of timely epidemic monitoring and early warning, the failure of closed loop management for high-risk positions, the formality of routine nucleic acid testing, the lack of disinfection of cold chain items at each link, the inadequate management of centralized isolation facilities, and the inadequate scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that we focus on nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of the port city, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the shortcoming of epidemic prevention and control in the port city, scientifically and accurately do the prevention and control work, and strengthen and tighten the external prevention and control line.
The notice emphasizes that the border cities should study and deploy the prevention and control of the epidemic at the same time, publish and open up the hotline for民生保障, regularly check the potential risks of basic life supplies and prices, and solve and respond to the outstanding problems in a timely manner.
According to the notification, the coastal cities referred to in the notification include the coastal cities of open land, water and air ports in the county (city, district and flag), the city (city, district and county) and the city (city, district and province) and the city (city, district and city) and the city (city, district and district) and the city (city, district and district) referred to in the notification. The specific scope is determined by the provinces (provinces, autonomous regions and cities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and timely announced.

The truth of the bloodthirsty killing of the US military for 20 years - Xinhua
(Video source: YouTube)
On November 11, a micro-documentary called "Machine of Death" on the oil pipe platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States using the pretext of "anti-terrorism" to launch the war in Afghanistan, forcibly exporting American democracy through war, and 20 years of warfare, bloodthirstiness and massacre of innocents, committing various crimes against humanity.
Using drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distorting human nature and forming a killing team.
In the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan.
The US military set up a "black prison" to torture and humiliate the "defendant" in various ways.
More and more Afghans are angry with crimes against humanity.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorist" war is "anti-terrorist".
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan, but only devastation and destruction.
Watch the video, let's expose the truth of the US' bloodthirsty killing under the pretext of "anti-terrorism", and expose the false face of American democracy!
I accidentally saw this article, which talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the tax-free zone to do the canning, although the canning is a deep processing and is not the business scope of the tax-free logistics company. This text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and met many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the canned and bottle milk are the same. There is no difference.
So, everyone will ask: Why is the bagged shelf life one year, while the bottle shelf life is two years or longer?
Or you may ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bagged so large?
In fact, many consumers or mothers think this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the more expensive is the better.
Some consumers also said that the taste or smell of the can was different after eating.
Now I will tell you the reason for the high price of earphones. Where is the high price?
Why are the prices so different?
Because when the manufacturer sets the price, most of it is based on the assumption that if the bagged price is too high, consumers will be difficult to accept, which means that the manufacturer will generate little profit or no profit, so what will the manufacturer do to survive?
So they have a big increase in the price of the goods to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers are promoting listening, not bags.
And you think so many manufacturers spend millions or even billions of dollars every year on advertising, where does this money come from?
Everyone knows it.
So, with the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, such as the promotional staff of the supermarket, the display cost of the supermarket, the gift cost of the product, and advertising costs, are also increasing.
Therefore, all manufacturers are also increasing their new products, which are also in the form of earphones, and their prices are also increasing. In fact, this is a new product that comes out as a result of the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, but their increased costs of raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands that will do whatever it takes to promote their products, link them with doctors in hospitals, and get them to help promote the products at a profit ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
And the relevant laws in China are absolutely not allowed to have such a method of operation. In fact, this is a way to deceive consumers.
It is suggested that people buy the powdered milk in bags and put it into the jar at home, which can save costs and increase the storage and sealing of the powdered milk for children.
And don't think that the shelf life of the canned food is longer than that of the bagged food. If the shelf life of the canned food is the same as that of the bagged food after opening the bag, it is more difficult to keep the canned food fresh and dry after opening the bag.
The delivery was late, the food was cold, and then it was dry and hard, which made it impossible to eat
And the sauce also poured out

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua
When you go to the book fair, you often feel the boom of success books.
Nowadays, many success books promote the best principle - that is, to assume or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what you need to "do it".
This means that you have bypassed the most important and fundamental link in the process.
For this reason, these books have a common characteristic - either to work hard to the best or to do nothing at all; either 100 or 0; or you climb Mt. You climb Mt.
This "optimal principle" will make everyone admit that it is right, but 99% of people will be scared at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a “you have to make a big change and make a 180-degree turn” path, which is the fatal weakness of many people.
For people who are stuck in tradition, stuck in conservatism, and refuse to change, you have to shout at his ear, “You have to change”, which is sure to be a hypocritical act and a joke.
Most people will be cowardly in front of the word "change" and hesitate to make a decision; or take a sudden impulse and make a decision to change, and brave to take the first step, but often it will not last for a long time, and it will collapse after a short time.
Mr. Ma Sili's famous "From tomorrow" parody is the best expression of this "common humanity".
The biggest problem of the "Best Practices" is that the threshold is too high, which often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, making most people "haggard".
Perhaps, the "less is more" principle is a possible way for more ordinary people to take a relatively successful path.
The core of the "less is more principle" is to "reduce the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "winning by winning small", that is, if you can't do 100, you can do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Everest, you can climb the little hill at your door, because that is always better than stagnating.
In summary, if you do something, it is always better than not doing anything.
Because the threshold has been greatly lowered, there is more possibility for ordinary people to achieve perseverance, and everything that is persevered will increase the probability of success.
It is just a matter of following the path of "second best" success.
In summary, the best principle, although on the surface it pretends to make everyone successful, can actually motivate a small number of people; while the second-best principle can motivate more people and make more people benefit.

The amount of raw fish resources in the Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporter Liu Xiaofei and Zhang Huanxiang) The reporter learned from the Shaanxi Provincial Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department that the latest monitoring results showed that the amount of naked鲤 resources in the Shaanxi Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 10.85 million tons. Compared with the initial protection in 2002, the cumulative increase was more than 40 times.
The naked carp of the Qinghai Lake is also known as the Qinghai carp, which is an extremely rare fish species in the Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the security and biodiversity of the "water - fish - bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, influenced by factors such as human large-scale hunting and the deterioration of the environment of the breeding water of naked鲤, the number of naked鲤 in the Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the amount of raw fish resources in the Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In the 2004 edition of the Red List of Endangered Species in China, the Qinghai Lake Naked鲤 was listed as an endangered species.
Since 2003, the Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on the lake fishery and prohibited any unit, collective or individual to catch naked salmon in the Qinghai Lake and the major rivers and tributaries of the lake, and prohibited the sale of naked salmon and its products.
At the same time, measures such as artificial enrichment and release, as well as the clearance of the main rivers of the Qinghai Lake and the design of scientifically and reasonably “fish passage” have been continuously strengthened, and the amount of Qinghai Lake naked salmon resources has increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, the Shaanxi Lake Naked鲤 has been stocked with more than 180 million fish, contributing more than 23 percent to the recovery of the Shaanxi Lake Naked鲤 resources.
The三江源 region of Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source for China and even Asia, while the Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone for the westward spread of desertification.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Gorges region and the waters of the Qinghai Lake, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since the beginning of this year, Qinghai has issued a series of prohibitions on fishing in the waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, and built a comprehensive fishing ban management system for the “one river, one river and one lake”.

I just saw a long article on menstruation.
科普 to unknown men.
Most girls will experience their first period suddenly at the age of 13 to 15, and will stop menstruating at the age of 50.
After a healthy condition, it will come more regularly every month.
But it is not a rule that can accurately predict, about a week of deviation, it needs to be prepared in advance, sometimes it will also crash (suddenly, it will be prepared a few days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood loss and the degree of menstrual cramps vary from person to person, some people have it for three days, some for one week; some people have less bleeding, some have major bleeding. Some people have no reaction, some people are so painful that they have to be taken to the ambulance; the degree of menstrual cramps will change with time. It used to be painful does not mean it will be painful forever.
The flow of menstrual blood cannot be controlled for a few days before and after the period, and the only thing you can do is to use sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood to prevent it from spilling on the seat and clothes.
The main reason for menstrual cramps is due to the production of prostaglandins. If you take ibuprofen when the cramps begin, it can effectively relieve the pain in the month. If you take it after the cramps begin, it will have no effect.
During the period before menstruation, due to uterine swelling and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If you suddenly have diarrhea without any reason, you will have your period within two days.
The sanitary pad should be changed every two or three hours, otherwise it will be easy to breed bacteria. If the sleep time is taken into account, the worst case is to change it six times in a day, which is 42 times a month, which is 50 times a month.
(Here, the tampon can be changed every 5-6 hours, and the longest is 8 hours)
The hormonal imbalance during the period of menstruation may be more violent, and the mood may be unstable during the period of ovulation, which is very unfortunate. The body is playing tricks on you.
However, the official crime rate data shows that the ability of women to control emotions is still high, and they will not use emotions as a pretext.
The flow is not only blood, but also the detached uterine tissue.
After the menstruation, the uterine wall is the thinnest, and then gradually thickens, which can be understood as the uterus is a house, building a house (the uterine wall thickens) every month to welcome guests, but the guests did not come, and all the houses were demolished (the menstruation was discharged), and the next month, the new house was built, and so on.
The period is very inconvenient. It has been going on for more than 50 years, and it has been bleeding for a few days every month for 24 hours, and it will also have abdominal pain and backache. Who wants it?
But you were born because your mother had gone through her period. The period was to prepare a house for you to stay in for 10 months when you came into the world. You should thank your mother for her regular and healthy period.
In the past, many things for women were suppressed. The society taught women that they were dirty, shameful, and everyone thought that was the case. But the times have changed.
If someone thinks that menstruation is disgusting and that the body of a woman is prepared for pregnancy, it should not be said in public. Girls should stand up and stop thinking like this. This has never happened to them and they will never happen to them. It is not very well understood by men. This attitude is too disgraceful to face your mother and too disgraceful to want your child?
Finally, sisters try tampons, they are really good.
Today is the winter solstice, and the wrong delivery is disappointing
We need to order another meal for the kids.
It is hoped that the store will check the product at any time during its busy time.
Is it electric shock?
Choosing a suitable foot bath can play a good role in foot therapy and health care. Today, this article will answer this question and hope to help friends.
As people's awareness of health is increasing, foot baths are becoming more and more popular among consumers. There are a number of different foot baths on the market, ranging from more than 100 yuan to more than 1,000 yuan. This gives consumers a great selection space.
On the relevant data surface, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of foot baths and other health-related household appliances are hot, but foot baths do not have special industry standards, so there is a certain safety risk.
It is really dangerous to soak your feet in a charged water!
Mr. Li told the reporter that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday present, but when his father bathed his feet, he felt his feet were numb.
Mr Li initially thought that it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt a little numb.
Mr. Li tried the pencil and it turned on. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was charged.
Then he contacted the merchants, and the merchants were quite good. Although he withdrew the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation on the setting of the highest temperature, which is suitable for who, which material is safe, and so on.
However, in general, a foot bath is not likely to have a problem with electricity. However, it is not excluded that some products are not strictly checked at the time of production.
Therefore, when buying, choose a separate foot bath.
There is no safety risk.
At the same time, you can measure it with a pencil.
The opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Fair - Viewpoint Top News - Hunan Daily Network - Huanxi Online
Changsha Daily, October 12 (all-media reporter Zhang尚武, Huo盼盼, Correspondent Liu Xiaoling, Photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and the introduction of the new Yunfu red tea were held at the Changsha International Exhibition Center. The exhibition showed the tea industry, innovative tea science and technology, promoted the tea culture and accelerated the goal of a billion yuan of the tea industry.
The Vice President of the Council of the China National Agricultural Cooperative Union and the Vice President of the Provincial People’s Congress Assembly attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhenhua, an Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand introduction at the opening ceremony: the source of the red lake is in Xinjiang, and the rise of the red tea has become a new impetus for “Five Color Xiang Tea”.
In recent years, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of the billion-yuan Hunan tea industry, forming a development pattern of “three Hunan, four water and five colors of tea”.
The tea industry in the province has increased its innovation, and the main tea types, including green tea, black tea, and red tea, have been on the offensive at the same time. The tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of tourism and tea, leading to an increase in income for the vast number of tea farmers.
风水 is changing, and red tea is making a comeback.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after harvesting green tea, harvesting red tea and black tea, farmers have income throughout the year and the output value of the tea field has risen rapidly.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders honored the fourth batch of enterprises that had the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark. Xinhua received the "Hunan Red Tea Origin".
In the new tea exhibition hall, Fujian tea merchants saw a high mountain tea called "ice in spring" and immediately ordered it.
Wang Jian, secretary general of the provincial tea industry association, said that at present, factors such as the current epidemic and other things have a certain impact on the tea market, but from the point of view of the tea fair, there are many highlights.
The red tea from Xinjiang has added the cultural connotation of tea culture, making it popular and lively, and welcoming a new spring for the Jiangxi tea industry.
If these foods are not hot, can you cancel?
I don't want it, because he couldn't deliver it because there was no place to park.
Philosophy is the study of problems that cannot be answered directly through perception.
The metaphysics is the basic rule of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The English translation of the Chinese name "Philosophical" is derived from the phrase "Philosophical" in the "Transmission of the First Book of I Ching", which means "Philosophical" in metaphysics.
The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extension problems.
The essence of ontology is "to study which nouns represent real existence entities and which nouns represent only a concept".
Philosophical naturalism, which denies the existence of God.
According to his theory, all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, which is supported by philosophers who support science and evolution.
The method of naturalism refers to a research method that does not speak to God.
The spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain).
The two views of dualism and monism are the two major views on the relationship between the mind and the body.
Knowledge theory is a philosophical branch that studies the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically considers and studies human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the behaviors accepted by a group or a culture.
It is mainly divided into the abstract ethics (abstractly researching ethical theory or criticizing the essence) and the standard ethics (judging various different moral views and giving moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral behavior rules people should follow, ethics (applying ethical theories to actual life situations, including biological ethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live, summarizing it from observed styles).
The ethics review is not based on the expected theory, but on the actual moral agent (moral agent) who makes and is observed to make a real decision, which all the moral factors of this decision, and it studies the ethical outlook of social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.

He was born in the year of the sheep and in the month of the sheep. He walked on the grass and got what he wanted. He was called "Taibai."
He is known as a "confusing genius" in the industry for publishing works such as "The Thai Mysterious Record", "The Indian Mysterious Record", "The Japanese Mysterious Record" and "The Korean Mysterious Record". He claims to be "able to talk nonsense casually".
The book, also known as "The Dark in the Light", "The Mysterious Mysterious Mysterious Mysterious", uses a new work, "The Dark in the Light", to take you deep into the marrow of Chinese folk customs. What legendary tales have been passed down to this day? What beautiful and tragic love songs are behind them?
The two "strangers on the way", Nanyuan Building and Moon Hua, have once again opened up the exploration of death. Their origins are about to be revealed.
The “Thriller Genius” Bai Xiaoyao bleached his hair and donated a million copies of his best-selling books!
This is a new work by the same author and the same protagonist, which is a continuation of the story of the "Thailand Incident Report" and the "India Incident Report".
He gave you one thing, and you have to pay for a chicken sauce.
You called the restaurant to bring it
I don't want to go downstairs to buy things, so I will spend so much money to order a delivery
丁子霖: to a friend.
I sincerely thank you for the humanitarian assistance you have given to us during the long period of more than 30 years since my family member's death, especially since I personally appealed for humanitarian assistance to friends overseas and domestically at the beginning of 1994.
Nowadays, most of the dead parents have died, and the orphans have also grown up and become employed.
Your act of selflessness has helped us through the most difficult time.
At present, the COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping the world, and most donors have reached their retirement age.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to suspend the humanitarian donations to the mother group of Tiananmen Square. This humanitarian aid should have come to an end long ago.
I will always remember your love, and I will believe that your deed will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I have to express my wishes in this way. Please forgive me!
Accept my sincere wishes.
陶业按： I would like to take this opportunity to introduce to you the history of the IFCSS and MCDF, which has been engaged in humanitarian aid for 32 years.
In carrying out humanitarian aid, the National Federation of Teachers' United States and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, and the implementers of the project often cross.

The aid money often cannot be delivered to the people of Tiananmen Square.
In 1994, under the suggestion of Ding老师, a special group was set up to coordinate and manage the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the "六四 orphan education fund", which was executed for 11 years. In 2009, after all the orphans of the六四 were graduated from universities, MCDF set up the " <v>六四 old people special hardship fund</v> " and has been executed to this day.
The funds for these projects come mainly from campus and social donations in the六四 years, from individual generous donations, and are supported by the brother university democracy foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Prison Reform Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the descendants of the Tiananmen Massacre finally received a donation from Hong Kong that was raised in the name of the Tiananmen Massacre.
During this period, China Human Rights also independently carried out its humanitarian aid project.
We understand that Mr. Ding called a halt to the donation for the六四, which is for donors to consider, and we are all retired old people, so we sincerely thank Mr. Ding for his letter to friends.
We will respect the decision of the beneficiaries and terminate the project within two years and resume at the request.
I would like to thank and respect those brave souls who have been generous and risk-taking in delivering humanitarian aid for many years.

Member evaluation
[effect] photo effect: took two clothes and overall it was good. I liked the picture one more.
[Service] Service Details: Because I was a little uncomfortable when I was pregnant, the makeup artist and the staff were very kind to me and let me rest for a while. They even gave me hot water to drink.
Package price: 1000 yuan
Thank you for the review of the rabbit. I originally said that it was not suitable for the old style. I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thanks for your recognition, your satisfaction will make us full of energy to continue forward. We will continue to push forward!
This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend all my friends to come!
No matter from reception, make-up, clothing, lighting, photography and post-production, it is flawless.
The makeup artist is very meticulous and can match your style to make you look your best. The makeup is also made by the top brands.
Mr. Tian Liang, for example, is a professional photographer.
The whole studio is full of artistic atmosphere, and there are two small cats to play with.
We are working in Beijing, and most photo studios in Beijing need to wait at least six months in advance to take photos. Our colleagues have taken photos in Beijing, and they think the result is just so-so.
I specifically searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and we think this is also the short version of most people. The photographer Li Guo will capture the moment of natural beauty and record it.
Make-up artist, photographer, post-production designer, a fine team.
Everyone praised us and praised us.
She has recommended her friend to go, and her friend just saw the film and was equally happy.
It is hoped that such a studio will not be hidden, and more people will discover it and make it their own style, rather than a cliché.
Thank you very much for the five-star review of Zhan Yao and Jing玲, both of whom are very creative new people. We are a creative studio, and we will do our best to complete the project if the customer likes it. Thank you for meeting us.
The sweet assistant and the lively photographer teacher, every member of the team was super nice and beautiful. It was a wonderful shooting experience, and it will never be forgotten. And the shooting effect was much better than I expected. Thank you so much everyone.
Thank you for your review. It is also a blessing to meet you. From Hohhot to Qingdao. Our trust is as long as thousands of kilometers. I am happy to meet you. I hope to come to Qingdao again next time.

An aspiring programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to do training, but if you don't have such an idea, it is better to learn by yourself, because training will cost a lot of money and take 6 months to learn.
However, if you intend to get into this industry, training is a very good choice. Especially for those who have a weak sense of discipline, training is a very good choice.
If you have a strong self-discipline, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, we should see the strength of the teachers in this institution. If the strength of the teachers is not strong, this training institution will not have any meaning. Of course, some new training institutions have not strong teachers.
Secondly, before choosing the training institution, it is better to inquire about the students who have graduated from the institution, since only the students who have graduated from the institution know how the institution works, whether the courses are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because for your own situation, I have not made a certain introduction, and the learning of this thing and the personal situation have a great relationship.
For example, the professional, the age, the language you want to learn, and even the city where you want to study or work, will all be related to the industry you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or if you are a computer professional who has graduated, then if there is enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective, and many online and offline training institutions are actually very good. However, if the cost of learning is high and the time invested is more, it basically needs to be trained for 3 to 6 months.
However, if I say these situations, it is very convenient to learn by yourself. Now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are also many training resources on B站. If you can't find the resources, you can also contact me to get free resources or detailed consultations.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video to learn.
If you are not a computer professional, but can also pay a certain learning cost and time cost, then it is recommended to learn at a training institution. This will not be difficult to learn, the teacher will explain it in detail, and there will also be people who will answer your questions. In addition, there will also be help in learning planning and supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, and there will be internship positions, so that you can save a lot of time when you apply for a job.
These are some of my opinions. The above is because I do not know your situation, so it is not detailed. If you have any other questions, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said before 1, I saw it in the app
What is it called?
I haven't finished yet, what are you doing?
Me, I take on all kinds of (installation, cleaning, repair) of boilers, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, smoke ovens, light fittings, glass cleaning, professional caulk, home care services.
Thanks to those who have given me a thumbs up, I have worked hard for my life. Life is tiring, but I must continue.
Life will not let anyone down, so don't hesitate to like and follow me. Thank you for those who have supported me in silence.
Life is like this. Everyone only looks at the result, and we are alone to support the process. In front of life, we can only be strong and continue. There is no other choice. We can look back, but we cannot go back.
Cleaning is work and responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of care.
Although we do the most dirty work, we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the client's house. When we see the satisfied smile and big thumb of the client, all the fatigue is worth it. The effort will have a reward!
My daily work
--Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, and leave a good impression.

Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp is beautiful, it will be dull if it is not cleaned for a long time. Only after it is cleaned can it shine. Life is the same.
It takes a lot of effort to succeed, and a lot of care and attention to create a beautiful seam. We are serious about it.
Give me a chance, I will make you satisfied, quality is everything, because professionalism is worthy of trust, your confidence is my encouragement!
All kinds of businesses are difficult at present!
However, I always believed that if I put in some hard work, I would be better than others at least. At least, I would be better than sitting around and complaining!"
The key to a good day lies in the morning, and all the good things begin in the morning. I hope you start your new day with happiness, luck, health and good fortune. Start a new day and keep a good mood throughout the day. Good morning.
When you were a child, happiness was something you had; when you grew up, happiness was a goal; when you became mature, you found that happiness was a mindset; when you understood, you were happy.
Do your best to be the most honest and kind person you can be, act according to your heart, and have no regrets in this life; there is only one road in life, and you should follow your own path; there are two treasures in life: good health and good mood, and live a beautiful life to the end!
Every stage of life will encounter different difficulties.
Many times, the restraint is not the ability, but the courage to face actively.
If you can't avoid it, you should face it.
If you are afraid, you will be defeated by difficulties; if you face difficulties, the problem will be solved.
China and Saudi Arabia jointly held the first two-year contemporary art exhibition in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Hsiui and Hu Guo) Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial, the Darey Contemporary Art Biennial, was officially opened to the public on November 11 in the Darey Art District in the northern part of Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia, with the participation of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and other places.
This biennial exhibition was jointly planned by the Saudi Driyya Biennial Foundation and the China UCCA Yue Run Contemporary Art Center. The curator of the China UCCA Yue Run Contemporary Art Center, Tian Fuyi, was appointed as the artistic director.
According to the organizing team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "crossing the river by touching the rock", which is an allusion to the reform strategy adopted during the social and economic transformation period and reflects the current situation of Saudi social and cultural development.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters. The exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings and is presented in six units: "Touching the Rocks to Cross the River", "Transmission as an Experiment", "Border Thought", "Going to the Public", "Beautiful New World" and "The Spirit of Art".
Among them, the number of works of 27 Saudi artists accounts for more than 40% of the total number of works in the exhibition, including painting, installation art and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly regarded, some artists use recycled materials in a novel way to create works, for example, Xu Bing used discarded materials to reconstruct a classic landscape painting in the series of stories behind the story (2014).
Chief Executive of the Dubai Biennale Foundation, Babakir, said that he hoped that this biennale would establish international dialogue and let the global audience know about the booming cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interaction and exchange.
Tian Yuyi said, "The goal of the biennial is double. It not only allows Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, but also allows Saudi audiences to integrate themselves into the contemporary art world."
It is reported that a series of seminars will also be held during the opening week of the two-year exhibition. Artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss issues such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare jobs - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) in order to continue to do a good job in employment assistance for the poor, consolidate and expand the results of the poverty eradication campaign, Yunnan Province has recently issued relevant policies to promote the management of public welfare jobs in rural areas, helping to comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources Department, at present, Yunnan has developed 44,83,000 rural public service posts, which are used to employ rural vulnerable groups such as laborers who have been lifted out of poverty, and play an important role in helping the poor achieve employment gains, consolidate the results of poverty eradication, and effectively enhance the capabilities of rural public services.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Affairs, Rural Revitalization, Finance and so on. The main purpose of the regulations is to standardize the scope of applicants for rural public service posts, the management of funds, the development of posts and the management of posts.
In the setting of job development, the new rules are clear. According to the principle of "job setting according to need, person setting according to job, dynamic management and total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person, one job, voluntary public and unified management", job development is set up.
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, inspection, publicity, employment, pre-employment training and appointment.
In addition, the new regulations also clarified the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts and the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare posts, and stipulated that each rural public welfare post development department should buy business accident insurance for the personnel of rural public welfare posts. The relevant departments were required to regularly supervise the subsidy of rural public welfare posts.

Hello.
Can you cancel the order?
I ordered again
Is it cancelled?
Second, although the right-wing had a successful era in history, it was short, so it was short because the sun shone brightly, and the water shone brightly when you drank it. If you were a little successful, you would feel happy, and if you were a little defeated, you would feel angry.
But in fact, the right-wing played a positive role in social progress.
The positive significance of the right wing should not be denied in terms of ending the definition of truth and standard, developing the economy and improving science and technology and promoting institutionalization and human rights protection.
Third, for me, although I do not fully agree with some of his opinions, I care about his opinions and respect him as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China and about social problems in China.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, and I think that anti-revolution is necessary, and the revolution inevitably leads to social turmoil,民生 damage, political groups are mixed, and then foreign countries take advantage of it.
Four. Change or improve China must have patience and the attitude of responsible for the country and the people. Political opportunistic attempts to take advantage of the fire are not right-wingers, but idiots.
Let's talk about left.
The left, in fact, is a group of time and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will also listen to some right-wing speeches and analyze their thoughts when it is needed, but the left has no chance because the left wants exactly what the Communist Party is throwing away!
Five. I recently saw some friends fighting against the enemy while refuting the left crazy, which made me angry. I think it is not necessary.
Do not try to reason with the traitor and the leftist, they are all stubborn, there is no reason to talk.
Do not try to prove that we are right, and do not think of letting the traitor and the left crazy admit it, why?
I tell my friends this: when the traitor yells at you five dollars, and when the leftist yells at you right dog, it just proves that our middle road is right!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but forget their ideals when they are old, or pursue ideals and become obsessed.
And the ideal is getting farther and farther away, and even the dragon boy becomes a bad dragon.
I think the left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom. China should be to the left according to the inherent gene of history and culture.
On the one hand, the right-wing liberals in the country attach importance to efficiency and development, while the left-wing liberals strengthen supervision and pay more attention to fairness and security.
At present, the society generally hopes to pay more attention to fairness, while China and the United States are at war, and the left is certain. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand it, I will like it.
Nothing to say, flowers are so kind
In the past two years, the blockade and blockade of the United States on the chip of Huawei has not only brought unprecedented difficulties to Huawei, but also caused huge losses for "US-based" enterprises.
The United States has suppressed the chip industry in China and demanded that its own enterprises and related enterprises in other countries block the chip industry in China at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers will be affected, leading to a decrease in the R&D investment of chip production enterprises and a decrease in production capacity, resulting in a disorder of the chip supply chain worldwide.
Nowadays, the shortage of chips has affected all sectors of the global economy, such as the shutdown of car companies and the rise of mobile phone prices. Almost all industries that use chips have been affected.
In order to grasp the “chip” sovereignty, more and more technology giants in many countries have begun to take the road of “going away from the United States”.
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights and restrain the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry, the United States has been making frequent moves recently. It is also the host of the “chip summit”. It is also inviting 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and provide financial support for American domestic technology giants, such as Intel, the United States’ oldest technology giant, to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, United States, and open the chip manufacturing business to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel's move would cause a certain impact on TSMC and may take away TSMC's "job", they were wrong.
The reason for this certainty is that Intel, as a well-known US technology giant, has been cultivating in the semiconductor industry for decades and has a large talent team and technical reserve. It is certain to rise rapidly and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, for this decision by Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (TSMC) founder Zhang Zhongming is indifferent.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongming surprised everyone when he said that Intel had spent a lot of money to build a chip factory. Zhang Zhongming was quite frank when he said that Intel had built a chip factory, which was quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongming disliked Intel's entry into the chip industry because he still had a grudge with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the jewel of the United States' manufacturing industry and stood at the top of the world in the semiconductor industry.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip was completed by a factory from design to packaging and testing. Intel was the representative of the era.
However, such a pattern makes some small and medium-sized enterprises burdened, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs have to look away from the huge construction costs of production lines.
Under the influence of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show the phenomenon of division and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongming heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he believed that since there was a company specializing in design, it was possible to establish a factory specifically for chip manufacturing.
Shortly afterwards, Zhang Zhongming's idea turned into reality, and TSMC was born.
台积电 focused on the "wafer processing" single link, without design, and only provided the wafer manufacturing subcontract service.
At that time, the newly established Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was a small slave before Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongming had sought Intel Investment, but at that time, Intel had heard that TSMC only did manufacturing in the chip industry, which seemed to be arrogant and disdainful of TSMC, so it had refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongzheng also believed that Intel at that time was despising the wafer process service.
It was not expected that the company that despised the chip manufacturing service in the past would now have to start chip manufacturing.
So, Zhang Zhongming thought that Intel entering the chip manufacturing was a joke.
Now the market value of TSMC has exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of Taiwan Semiconductor's strong offensive, Intel is also afraid to be stuck.
Today, TSMC has pushed ahead to the 3nm chip, while Intel is still stuck at the 7-year-old 14nm.
It is not easy to catch up.
Not waiting
The order was placed at 19:06.
Today, let's take a look at some strange hot search.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: the Spring Festival dragon rising on February 2, the rise of the price of Good Liar, and the event of the freight carrier, the spread of the public opinion will form a peak, and then the index will decline (smooth curve), and finally dissipate. If there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small hump again.
They look exactly the same as the model shown on the official website of the Internet Information Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot topics from the same event, and present them as a "peak-like", "saw-like" and " cliff-like".
The "peak-like" is to be heated by human beings and quickly climbs the hot search list, attracting the public's attention; the "saw-tooth-like" is to be heated periodically and ensures that the hot search list is dominated by the topic; the "ocean cliff-like" is to be evacuated collectively and the hot search list will play its role.
In Figure 9, the heat wave peak of the event coincides with the heat wave trough of the other event, and the time difference is less than a second, which means that the unified water force received the task and launched a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black PR can be seen from the fact that dozens of hot search keywords are on the list at the same time. Which attracts the attention of the public, which is responsible for popularization, which is responsible for propaganda, which is responsible for stirring up, which is responsible for influencing cognition, which is responsible for misguiding judgment, which is responsible for stirring emotions, which is responsible for influencing decisions, which is responsible for propaganda, which is responsible for influencing emotions, which is responsible for influencing decisions, which are responsible for propaganda, which are responsible for influencing emotions, which are responsible for influencing decisions, which are responsible for propaganda and which are responsible for influencing emotions.
Communication is a science, without taking into account the subjective factors of position and emotion, and only from the objective data, black PR will be nowhere to hide.
Every step will leave a trace, and such traces will be dug out together.

received money
The order is a claw
Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I explained to your staff
Your rider told me the address is too far
360 integrated home decoration
Address:No. 156, Ring Road, Happiness Home, 12th floor
It was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to see. At first, my budget was 7,000 yuan for a basic renovation.
He started a series of tricks at the shop.
I was the first to come to the shop and just showed them my floor plan. They did not go to the site to measure the house. They were able to give me a quote saying that my 135 square metre house would be possible at 7,000 yuan. They showed me their materials and I did not know what brand they were using.
Their second trick is that if you just come to the shop, you will be dragged to pay the deposit (and this money will never be refunded, unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I hesitate whether to pay the deposit, they will invite their so-called manager to tell you that you can get a certain discount if you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit, and I am an example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid more than 10,000 yuan in advance.
He gave me a lot of questions about the price of 7,000, including the renovation of water and electricity, including any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, and these three are the main costs of the base installation.
They also charge higher service fees than other companies.
I lost confidence in this company and signed the contract without telling them the truth.
When I went to find them to withdraw the money, they showed a lot of experience. There was a special team to deal with you.
In any case, it is the customer's problem to bite the bullet. They have no responsibility at all.
There are many excuses, and there are many details, I don't want to tell you all the tears, so don't choose them, because my friend also hired them to renovate the house, and the quality of the renovation was not good.
坑爹, they are the original head decoration that deceived people, and now they have changed to big beauty, which seems to have closed and changed to another.
So don't choose such a shameless construction company.
In the future, when you choose, you can Google it a little bit, because it is not a small amount of money.
To ask a question to the merchant, please log in or register first.
It is strictly prohibited to release various forms of business reviews, and detailed information can be found in the business listing statement.
You can find the latest business information such as the address, phone number, and opening hours of the integrated home furnishing company on the Meituan Construction Design Channel of the Meituan Construction Design Channel of Meituan Construction Design Channel of Meituan.
This is so scary, cancel the order within 30 minutes!
Isn't there another way? For example, changing the address?
Okay, so don't cancel this conversation. If I don't get my money back in 5 to 10 days, I will investigate.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes.
The chicken was supposed to be cooked, but the meat was raw, so I couldn't eat it
The celestial body has a meeting with the Gemini meteor shower on the 14th. - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Yiquan) -- Astronomers introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Gemini meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will be the greatest on December 14. Friends who love meteor showers can observe it in the following midnight.
The Gemini meteor shower recorded by amateur astronomer Anju in Beijing in December 2018.
Most of the meteor showers have their parent bodies as comets, but the Gemini meteor shower has its parent body as the 3200th asteroid Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not to be the result of a comet.
Xie Liupeng, a member of the Astronomical Society of Tianjin and an expert in astronomy and popularization of astronomy, said that as a holiday movie, the Gemini meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year. The "film release period" can be extended from December 4 to December 17.
This meteor shower is known for its large and steady flow, and is together with the Perseid meteor shower and the Leonid meteor shower called the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
One of the significant characteristics of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteorite speed is slow, the color is rich, and there are not too many fire meteors. It is suitable for beginners to take pictures both in sight and in astronomy.
The shooting of the Gemini meteor shower by Tianjin astronomer Yang Yanyi on December 13, 2020.
According to the astronomical prediction, this year's Gemini meteor shower will arrive at its maximum on December 14 at about 15:00. At its maximum, the ZHR (the number of meteors per hour that can be seen under ideal observation conditions, when the radiation point is above the top of the head) is 150.
The recommended index of the Gemini meteor shower.
Last year, the Gemini meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be affected by the moonlight, and the brilliance will be reduced a little.
On November 14, the lunar phase is a full moon, and the bright moon will cause interference in the observation. The bright moon will fall in the last part of the night, and the radiation point of the Gemini流星 shower will rise.
Friends who like the meteor shower can observe it in the following hours after the moon sets. But be careful to keep warm and dry. "
How can we observe more meteorites?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with a high altitude, low light pollution and a wide view of the east in the suburbs or the countryside. Then, you can wait patiently until the moon falls to observe.
It is necessary to note that the flow of the Gemini meteor shower is very large in all directions, so it is not necessary to watch the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower in the observation.
If you are a friend who likes photography, you should choose a wide angle and a large aperture lens to take a breathtaking "large meteor shower". When shooting, you should use a high ISO and the maximum aperture.
For stability and continuity, tripod, spare battery and shutter cord are also indispensable. "
Xiao Pei reminded.
What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional television referred to by the topic should be the LCD television, while the difference between the laser television and the LCD television in market positioning is mainly two points.
First, laser television is focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the comprehensive market positioning of LCD televisions, laser televisions are obviously focused on the large screen market, or laser televisions are born for the large screen.
At present, mainstream LCD televisions are 55 inches to 65 inches in size, while laser televisions are generally 75 inches or more in size, and the largest is more than 100 inches. This fully meets the user's demand for large-screen LCD televisions.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TV sales and sales in the world has been increasing, and it has exceeded 60% in the overall television sales of more than 80 inches.
According to the prediction of China Everbright, the sales of laser TV will increase by more than 140% in 2020 and continue to maintain high growth.
The reason for such a good performance in the large screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent performance of laser television in the field of eye protection.
On the basis of the imaging principle of laser television, the light emitted by the laser light source does not enter the eye directly. Compared with the backlight of LCD television, the imaging process is closer to the natural condition of the object, and the stimulation on the eye is also smaller.
Through a strict comparison experiment between laser television and LCD television under the same conditions, the China Electronic Technology Standardization Institute Science and Technology Laboratory and Beijing Zhonghua Hospital Ophthalmologists have obtained 144 sets of test data.
The data confirmed that the laser television has a strong eye-saving property. In some aspects, it even has a certain improvement effect.
At a time when eye health is getting more and more attention, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with the advantage of protecting eyes, but also opens up a new breakthrough in the television market.
Second, laser TVs focus on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuous descent of the price of LCD televisions, the price of laser televisions on the market is generally more than 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price will gradually rise.
Why is the laser television so expensive?
It is certainly true.
Under the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be realized by LCD TV and projection.
With the ultra-short focus projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment. It can realize the experience of 100-inch screen at a short distance. The required space is not large, and the host is small and occupies little space.
In terms of brightness, the brand-name laser TV can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, it has a lower heat release rate and a smaller loss of equipment, so the life of the television is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with true 4K ultra HD picture quality, artificial intelligence system, and bio-inspired screen, which can provide users with more shocking visual and sound experience.
It is not a fake demand, but the result of demand subdivision. In terms of picture quality and cost-benefit ratio, laser TV is not a dish for video players. If you want to balance the large screen and the viewing environment, you can try it. There are both advantages and disadvantages, and you can judge it after weighing it. It is afraid of listening to a word.
In short, the ultra-wide-angle near-field projection laser television--laser television is forced to use the expensive ultra-wide-angle lens and reflector to approach the screen, which is not in line with the optical best design.
In order to block part of the environmental light, using a micro-structure Fresnel screen is expensive, and the price of 80 inches is basically able to exchange for 65 inches of LCD.
There is one more thing, I especially hate projection manufacturers to use the word "漫反射" as a selling point. Please, the light that the screen can see for the eyes is the direct light. If you use the word "漫反射" to reflect on the ceiling, you can not see it for the eyes. So, is there any difference between the LCD TV and the LCD TV? If you open the ceiling of the TV, will it also be illuminated?
And, if the projection screen is not a mirror, it will not be able to be like.
This is exactly what is ignored by the high-gain screen's hot spot (spot) effect. A large amount of light is reflected to the eye from a certain angle, which is really painful.

When I added the date of the appointment to the WeChat, the young lady sent me the time I could choose and the reply was timely.
Before going, I saw the shooting works in the shop, more of which were outdoor wedding dresses, which were beautiful and involved many styles of shooting.
After arriving on the day, I talked to the sister about my ideas and was very patient to help me try two of my indecisive style clothes. Finally, I decided to start makeup and style. The photographer will put some props in front of the camera, guide the action, and be more meticulous about the details.
But it may be because I didn't communicate the specific shooting ideas with you, so the style is not what I wanted, but it should be beautiful.
After taking the picture, the photographer will help you choose the picture, exchange the style of post-production and feel very careful.
It will take about half a month to fix the film. Wait and see.
The second time I got a photo-style霸王餐. Most of the clothes can be selected to be photographed.
Finally, she chose a black silk dress to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process will take about two hours, makeup + shooting, and the photographer responsible for shooting is the younger brother of the 95th generation, which is a bit immature. I hope that I can give more suggestions to customers in the future in the field of action guidance. He is quite talkative, and the shooting process is quite pleasant.

Go to the top of the page and see Queenie.
Before going to the store, I filled in my name and phone number, and then chose the clothes. The bridal gowns can be chosen. I changed three or four sets of clothes and was very patient. After choosing the clothes, I spent a lot of time on makeup. The service attitude was good. After the shooting, I will teach you how to arrange the pose. It seems that the face is too big when the picture is taken. The editing said that it will take about half a month or three or four days. It seems that there is no difference with the original picture.
The environment is overall good.
There are many optional clothes.
The makeup position is about three, and the inside is a photo studio.
The service was very warm and very attentive.
The hairstylist is very patient.
The photographer will also carefully teach you the action.
Not satisfied, the photographer will also ask for a re-take.
The <v>experience</v> may be a little over, and the original eyeliner was cut into three eyeliner.
The eyebrow was also cut, which was a little embarrassing for people who don't usually wear eyebrows.
The picture was given to me ten days ago, but the photo effect was not very satisfied, and I felt that the eyeliner was still obvious.
Because it is not clear what style to choose, I tried two sets and finally chose the black dress. The little sister said that this set is more in the style of Hepburn.
After choosing the clothes, I started to make up. The hairstylist and makeup artist were very patient and helped me make up. The result was very satisfied.
After getting my makeup and hair done, I started taking photos. The photographer had been guiding me to pose for the whole process. It was very easy and harmonious.
After the shoot, he carefully selected four of his favorite photos and made them a masterpiece. The result was very satisfactory.
I have not responded for three days... because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay
I have to pay the freight every time now
Is it OK if I can be exempted from paying my monthly fee until you have finished your investigation?
Is it safe to buy a small umbrella insurance?
The small umbrella is an Internet insurance broker platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokers (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance broker, one must meet the following three keywords: the shareholders and the initiators have no major illegal records in the past three years; the minimum limit is RMB 5 million; and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In fact, these three conditions are very strict, summarized as having strength, having been approved by the state authority of the National Bank of China (which supervises the insurance companies and banks within the country) and having a good style of ownership. As a small umbrella insurance company, the small umbrella insurance is not required to question the legitimacy of the small umbrella insurance, since there are three conditions. Not all insurance companies can meet these conditions.
At this point, it is good.
From the perspective of insurance products, the small umbrella insurance is a kind of insurance supermarket, and many celebrity super-disease insurance products are sold on this platform. For example, the latest super-disease insurance and Tai Tai Super Mary 5, the insurer and the insured are both Tai Tai Life, and the small umbrella insurance is a third-party mediator, so there is no doubt about its credibility.
From the point of view of payment mode: the products of the Internet platform are generally more cost-effective, and the payment mode is flexible, which can support monthly payment, relieve the payment pressure of the insurer, and maximize the leverage of the insurance.
This is still very good.
Consider it.
From the professionalism of salesmen: this is especially important, because insurance is a highly professional industry, and many online products can be insured by the customer himself. This will lead to many misunderstandings in terms of health notification and occupation. Non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective consciousness when they insure. They think that they are healthy or fit. This can easily lead to many insurance risks, and the risk of denial of insurance.
I have also done insurance phone sales at Tencent microinsurance (Tencent microinsurance is an online insurance brokerage platform), which is very responsible.
The insurance on the Internet is real and trustworthy, and the untrustworthy are people. There are no professionals in the Internet channels, and there are many sales misconducts.
For example, the insurance premium of 1 yuan is 600 million, and the insurance premium is free, and the mobile phone is also free. The premium of 6 million is also free. These marketing strategies are correct, but they avoid the main point and will not tell the insurer that the premium is 1 yuan in the first month and the premium will be charged at a normal rate in the second month. The premium is between 1 yuan and 200 yuan, and many customers have paid the premium for more than two years, but they do not know what the premium is.
He thought that he could spend 1 yuan and the insurance company would pay 60 million (a good fortune).
Free mobile phones are only sent to special insurance number segments such as 66666 and 88888, and if the winning text message is sent, you will not have to exchange it yourself and no one will remind you.
(This is another pit for the insurer) free of charge to receive 60,000 insurance premiums is short-term, if only relying on this, there is no other commercial insurance, and if there is a serious disease, 60,000 can do what, it cannot solve the problem, and the future life begins to run.
At present, for the misleading sales of Internet insurance, the state is punishing severely.
So, overall, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, and the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the sales agent.
It is suggested that the author take a comprehensive and careful consideration. In fact, many offline insurance brokers have more products and options for customers, and some products are more competitive than online products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers and insured offline products, saving each person 2000-3000 yuan/year.
If you have any questions, please communicate and exchange with me.
I am a business insurance agent with 3 years of experience in business management training and more than 1,000 users of enterprises. I have cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies and customized insurance products for customers based on their needs. I will try my best to get the best insurance results for customers during the insuring process. I will do the bookkeeping of the insurance contract, bookkeeping of the insurance contract and bookkeeping of the insurance contract for customers. I will make customers feel safe and secure.
To grow with each customer forever.
I hope my answer can help the OP!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance is a type of insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance procedures after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the insurer independently.
Although the Internet insurance has a lack of "ceremoniality" and even may not have printed copies of paper contracts, this does not affect the effectiveness and legal validity of electronic contracts.
This model is similar to the "telephone sales" generally, but such insurance purchase will also have a fatal problem, that is, the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for several decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about the "mediator" we choose and whether it is a "long-term insurance intermediary" that can provide us with service for many years?

From the beginning to now, I have always opposed any form of slander and insults, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this criminal.
If you don't look at the party and the faction, the first to be resisted is this uncivilized style.
Since you have started to send me Facebook friend request, and then published a humorous post, and then you have tried to publish the so-called my home location and father name on social media, I have taken a non-response attitude.
Afterwards, you have not only continued tagging me at the same frequency as one day six meals, but also continued to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook about some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, such as my appearance, my body, my good breeding, and so on, I... well, I... well.
But then I received a lot of messages from friends about your Facebook friends uploading a picture of you and saying that you were sexually harassed.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can't continue to be silent.
After you posted the news that I called the police, you went on to be more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you have, or what status you have, in our society, you need to respect each other.
Yes, you can continue this humorous, obscure, humiliating, and insulting speech, you can continue to say that you just care and care about me, you can continue to say that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not you, and you can continue to publish all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't and I can't stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you. My appearance and body shape don't need you to judge.
I don't even think that any girl would be willing to be humiliated by others in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, how are you?
I said that you wouldn't believe.
I don't think any girl can say she's fine after being bullied.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic morals will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of people.
I cut some comments for you to judge
It should be impossible for anyone to impersonate you.
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization

The main stream of the Yangtze River has achieved full coverage of green comprehensive services in the water area - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) The construction of the water green comprehensive service area in Chongqing, China, was completed on October 10, and was put into operation on October 10. This is the second water green comprehensive service area in the upstream of the Yangtze River after the water green comprehensive service area in Chengdu, Sichuan, was put into operation on August 8.
At this point, the water green comprehensive service area has covered the upstream, middle and downstream of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Jianghuai Navigation Administration, said that before, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces had built and operated 10 green comprehensive service areas in the middle and downstream of the Yangtze River, which had been recognized by a large number of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the water surface green integrated service area is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green navigation. The reception of marine pollution and the ability of navigation service have been significantly improved.
According to reports, the water green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing all-round production and living services for ships and crew members, and helping crew members solve the problems of "urgency, difficulty and hope".
The two green comprehensive services in the upstream of the Yangtze River have been built and put into operation. They are integrated into a single life service, production service and government service, with the theme of green environmental protection and the specialty of ship maintenance and emergency rescue service. This will make the crew of ships that sail in the Yangtze River work more efficiently and live more conveniently.
U.S. three warships gather in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon in the U.S. navy rarely visits the island of Guam in 2022-01-17. The latest satellite images show that three warships of the U.S. navy are gathering in the vicinity of China. The U.S. media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. navy was rarely visited the island of Guam, releasing important signals to its allies and enemies in the Asia-Pacific region.
According to the news of the "North China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" of China, on January 9, the satellite found the US Navy "Carl Vinson" (USS Carl Vinson) in the vicinity of the Balabac Strait.
The Strait of Malacca connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location in the West Pacific island chain.
The platform is expected to deploy "Carl Vinson" to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the F-35C fighter aircraft and the CMV-22 “fish-eye” airborne transport aircraft were deployed on the “Carl Vinson”.
The US Navy warships that are currently engaged in the operation in the Pacific are not only the USS Carl Vinson, which departed from the United States on March 3, but also the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on March 3.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C aircraft squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Aircraft Attack Squadron of the U.S. Marine Corps.
In addition to the two above-cited warships, the US Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan (USS Ronald Reagan) docked in Yokohama, Japan.
The combat group includes the "Major" missile cruiser "Major" missile cruiser "Major" and the "Major" missile destroyer "Major".
U.S. three warships gather in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapons have rarely visited the island of Guam in 2022. On January 17, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three U.S. warships were gathering in the vicinity of China.
(Tweeted by @SouthernStrategicSituationPerception) Three US warships gather in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapons have rarely visited the island of Okinawa in 2022. On January 17, the flight route of the US aircraft carrier-carrying transport CMV-22B.
According to a report by CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the arsenal of the US Navy was rarely visited by the island last weekend.
On Saturday (January 15), the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada," loaded with 20 Trident (Trident) ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Naval Base in Guam.
U.S. three warships gathered in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapons were rare to visit the island of Guam. Analysts said that this was a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first time for the US submarine to visit the island since 2016 and the second public visit to the island since the 1980s.
U.S. three warships gather in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapons have rarely visited the island of Guam in recent years. China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea in recent years.
The picture shows the Yongshui Island in the South China Sea.
(South China Sea Research Forum) In the statement, the US Navy said that the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada's" visit to the islands strengthened cooperation between the US and its regional allies and showed the US's ability, flexibility and readiness for war, as well as the continuous commitment to regional security and stability.
Submarines with ballistic missiles are usually called "bomber submarines".
The location of the 14 submarines of the US Navy fleet is usually kept secret.
The secret of the submarine around the ballistic missile submarine has made the "Raymarine Submarine" the "essential survival weapon" of the nuclear three-in-one system, including the launch井 ballistic missile in the United States and the B-2 and B-52 bombers with nuclear warheads.
When talking to his friends about the recent Meta falling by 26%, the market value of the company evaporated at a rate of US$2510 billion, Zuckerberg responded that he was facing unprecedented competition. What was the reason?
Meta (originally Facebook) is actually a advertising company, and its income mainly comes from advertising. Today's profitable advertising company, it has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and so on, regardless of what kind of function positioning, are meta traffic channels.
In addition, Meta is also the largest “advertising alliance”, and many external ads for apps are realized through Meta’s advertising platform.
But the times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta is difficult to get the user's data information, affecting the efficiency of ad placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is friendly to users, and it will be obvious to users whether to allow the App to obtain their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not to allow.
If Google cuts another knife, the impact on Meta's income will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in the growth of Meta's income has also weakened (this factor's proportion is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual income comes from China, mainly from companies doing business in the sea.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about hundreds of people, and there are several major agents in mainland China.
Companies in China want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is one of the most important advertising channels. Most of the money spent on Meta.
Interesting is that now TT is one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from it in the first two years.
All domestic agents are helping Byte to put ads there. Meta's performance in China is also very good.
Recently, I have not specifically studied it, but it will definitely not be better than before.
The stage of massive spending by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Third, the new flow channel expansion was not successful.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only concerned with income, but also with the expectation of the future.
Clearly, Meta's expectation is not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "original universe."
The actual universe should be one of the future directions, but the realization period of the actual universe is relatively long. This story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the past two or three years.
So the next two years should be difficult for Meta.
Although Facebook is currently very prosperous, it earns as much as 1,000 billion to 2,000 billion US dollars every year. In fact, Facebook is very worried about the crisis, which is much stronger than that of other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although his several social software now have a relatively high daily life and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has little confidence in the rapid development of TikTok, and the disruption will happen in a blink of an eye.
And the concept of organizing the universe in a short time is unachievable, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is also the reason why Zuckerberg is changing the company's name and is constantly seeking new routes, but I think his route selection is wrong and is a dead end.
