Students take the lead in Zhejiang University's academic year conference - Xinhuanet
Wash your hands with air, sniff to judge diseases, and search for the source of haze with precision Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Year Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of mind-blowing academic achievements were honored.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. The research covers the fields of environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, humanities education and other fields. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value. Some of these projects have won awards at home and abroad.
Biological sensor: Your family doctor
The team of Zhang Di, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a bio-sensor on a mobile phone, which is half the size of a mobile phone.
You just need to breathe a little bit, and the instrument can detect your health condition from the components of the gas you breathe out. "
Zhang Di Meng said that this sensor is connected to the smart phone. After exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Most of the smart rings on the market can only detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biological sensor uses graphene, a new material. Its target is chemical elements. Its keen "smell" makes it more deeply and accurately reflect the health condition.
Intelligent surgery light: doctor's high energy eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart surgery lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver medal at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Inventive Exhibition.
The team of Master's students Zhu Lin靖 and Shen Junfei of the School of Optics and Photonics found a new idea in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented an intelligent LED surgical lamp.
Many diseases cannot be detected and removed in time, which is related to the light in the doctor's operating room.
Shen Junfei said that for example, when doctors cannot see all the tumor tissue in the early stage of cancer, then cancer cells will spread.
This intelligent surgical light has four lamp holders, and can adjust the spectrum to enhance the difference between different tissues under the light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and transparency of the light spot according to the needs of the operation and the personal habits of the patient.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Shao Yifu Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University Medical School and the Children's Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University Medical School, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash hands with air: save water and cool
Most people wash their hands with water, rub a little soap, squeeze a little hand sanitizer, but Li Qiqing and his classmates invented a "air hand sanitizer device".
As long as you stand on the toilet of the device, our weight can compress the air.
It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
So we can wash our hands! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiment proved that the effect of this method of hand washing is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can not only ensure the洗净 degree, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many world top universities and won the only gold medal.
Please arrange for me to be reimbursed as soon as possible, thank you

Good, trouble
This certificate is very meaningful - emergency certificate
This is one of my important skills certificates besides my driving license!
普及一下：急救措施实际上是应急救援，即在救护车来之前抢救。
It is well known that there is actually a period of time between the arrival of the ambulance and the accident, and this is the most critical period.
This is the time to call an ambulance.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, and respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, it is so important that people around you know how important CPR is!
When someone falls down, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them, rather than just stand there and do nothing, which is too terrifying.
In China, there are 3 million accidental deaths every year, and the most dangerous is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the average is 15%.
In Las Vegas casinos and hotels, more than 70% can be saved, and Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%."
This is the first reaction founder Lu Le said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, and you pinch the nose will have no effect.
It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compression to rescue the person.
I found that few people at present have this consciousness of learning emergency medicine, but when things happen, it is too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can make timely responses to emergencies.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
The emergency card can be registered at the Red Cross training center in your local area. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. Students also have discounts.
PS. The last picture is a record of the goals that need to be completed before I turn 25. It has been months since I added the emergency card to the list of goals, but I did it!
Then I have to go and take the other certificates that I want to take. I am going to take the diving certificate. I have seen that there is a diving emergency certificate on Xiaohongshu. It seems that you have to have the emergency certificate to take the diving emergency certificate. So the emergency certificate is very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#
Among them, 13 yuan's crab cakes are one!
Not tried
How #NAME# is not written clearly?
Is it 13 yuan?
Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# failed to deliver the food. This time, only one shrimp dumpling was given to me!
Because I saw that the code was valid before I input it.
First of all, let's talk about the conclusion. I personally believe that "Four Seas" is a comprehensive bad movie, from all kinds of perspectives.
But if you say that this movie is not a highlight, it is not at least the music selection is good.
There are many kinds of garbage films, one of which is a film that can make you fall asleep in the cinema, and another is a film that can make you furious after watching it. For the audience, "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei, which can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Kuan is really extraordinary.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it seems to be a creation of a fantasy novel, difficult to describe, and there are many holes like a windbrella on the body of Mr. Ma.
Even after watching it, you will doubt whether there is a hidden metaphor in it, but when you think carefully, it is actually a pile of shit.
First of all, I have difficulty understanding some of the scenes.
The main character lives on a small island in the south.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranged that one of the neighbors drove a small面包 truck to take her to the northeast to see snow.
The old man sat in the truck from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his father are very confident about this.
Then the old man was silent.
How did the owner's brother get the business license for the hotel on the derelict ship?
Why can the small gang of bikers on the island easily close a mountain road?
Then the truck that was delivering the steel bars in the middle of the road stopped at the roadside, and the truck drivers couldn't find it.
This is too obvious.
Why did a gang of small criminals with no credit and suspected illegal activities become a deputy police officer?
Why didn't he call the police in the face of high interest rates? The police even asked if there was any difficulty.
An adult knows how to use a smart phone, but does not know how to open the door of the hotel with the room key, and then forcibly arrange to find the hotel owner and sleep outside the room?
This inexplicable plot permeates the entire film, and I feel pain when I recall it.
In addition to the plot, the worst thing about the film is its theme, or the film has no theme at all, but a hideous sewing monster.
At the beginning of the film, you think he wants to make a comedy film. Twenty minutes later, you guess it may be an inspirational film. Halfway through the film, you think it may be a drama film about the hardships of living in a small town. After watching the film, you don't even know what you have watched. This leads to deep doubts about yourself. Why did you go to the cinema to enjoy your excrement on New Year's Eve?
For most people, it is actually very familiar with the pattern of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then you should be inspirational and comedic, and then tell the audience about how a talented rookie is gradually successful.
If you want to shoot a love film, then you must tell the truth about the love and hatred between the young townspeople who like to ride motorcycles and the service girls.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot contain anything that is contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the role of the new motorcycle that was just burned and could sing) cannot open some brain holes that Kennedy could not bear.
As for the main character, although she is not a mentally retarded person, she behaves like a five-year-old child in some aspects. I don't know whether this is the reason for acting or the requirement of the director.
I also don't understand why Han Kuan is so interested in adding a crash scene to his own movie as a racing driver.
Is this movie arrangement in the Spring Festival period just to annoy the audience?

Production and processing equipment for concrete modules of inspection wells in Zhengzhou: Characteristics and advantages of Zhengzhou wall brick modules:
The Yixing inspection well brick machine equipment is widely used for the new type of brick material for the construction of municipal underground facilities such as coal, heat, water, electricity and gas.
For example, inspection wells, rainwater outlets, ditches, sewage tanks, small buildings, and wing walls of bridges.
The advantages of using concrete modules to build inspection wells are that the four sides of the modules are grooves, and the combination of masonry forms a chain lock.
The shear strength of the wall of the well is far better than that of the flat friction brick.
The module is a hollow structure. After combination, the longitudinal holes are connected, and the transverse holes are connected. After the injection of the core, it forms a reticulated concrete structure, which plays a secondary reinforcement and waterproofing role.
There are grooves on both sides of the module, and the horizontal and vertical grooves correspondingly increase the strength of the whole structure.

Chongqing Middle School Pilot Modern Apprenticeship System - Students are Employees of the Company - Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year on, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 middle vocational schools. Students who accept the pilot training will also have apprentice identities, and will be pre-registered as unit employees by the pilot enterprises after enrollment.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the standardization of the enrollment and acceptance of middle vocational schools and the use of engineering procedures by enterprises, clarifies the dual identity of middle vocational school students and enterprise employees, according to the principle of two-way selection, the apprentice, the school and the enterprise sign a three-party agreement, and for apprentices who are over 16 years old and under 18 years old, the apprentice, the guardian, the school and the enterprise sign a four-party agreement, so as to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching contents, rights and interests protection of apprentices on the job training.
The pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the modern apprenticeship form and cooperate with enterprises to jointly carry out pre-employment training and job rotation training for enterprise employees.
The pilot schools should reform the mode of talent cultivation.
The school and enterprises jointly design the talent training program, jointly formulate the professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise师傅 standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot is carried out in a cycle of study, and the time of internship for students in enterprises is determined according to the professional training program. The on-the-job internship generally lasts for six months.
In the practice of enterprises, the enterprise group management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, a teacher can lead 2 to 5 apprentices, form a learning group, and ensure that students master the skills required for each training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, we will set up 60 modern apprenticeship pilot projects at the municipal level, each of which will train about 50 students (apprentices). A total of about 30,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
In accordance with the principle of first pilot and then promotion, from the point to the whole, we should explore and establish a long-term mechanism for joint admission, joint training and integrated education between schools and enterprises, so as to effectively improve students' job skills and employment quality.

South African doctor: although the contagiousness of the virus is strong, most of the cases are mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the new variant of the coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although the transmission speed is faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, more than 5,000 doctors in a township in South Africa reported that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they treated were relatively mild, such as body pain and coughing, which are similar to the symptoms of the flu.
The director of the organization, Dr. Unben Pillay, said he saw dozens of patients a day, but none of them needed to be hospitalized.
Pelley: "They can control the disease at home, and most recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation. "
He said that this included elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to become seriously ill due to the coronavirus infection.
He said that compared with the previous wave of the Delta epidemic, the new coronavirus patients he treated in the previous wave were "breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen levels".
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
In the two weeks since the first report of the Omicron variant in South Africa, other doctors have shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observation and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, only 30% of the new coronavirus patients hospitalized in the past few weeks were seriously ill, which was half of the proportion in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent new coronavirus patients died, while the death rate was 20% in the early outbreak cases in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, quoted the data of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports as follows: "At present, almost all the signs indicate that this is a mild disease. "
He also said: "Now is still early, we need to get late data.
In general, the time of hospitalization and death is later, and we only have two weeks in this wave of epidemic. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the major new coronavirus strain in the world, the case of Omicrone has appeared in dozens of countries, of which South Africa is the center of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases in豪登省 in the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests showed that cases of the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90%.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes were all delivered!

Education commentary: What is needed to save abducted children?
If compared with the famous public welfare advertisement slogan "No sale, no kill," in a good environment where there is no demand for "recruitment," the community prevention and governance, and the whole people against the trafficking, make the trafficking behavior unprofitable, risky, and costly, such crimes will not occur frequently.
Recently, the Child Abduction Information Emergency Release Platform of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform established to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to find missing children.
I heard that the name of the app was "Union", and I felt warm.
New technologies not only have the name of "art and literature", but also are full of feelings. If they are used appropriately, they are practical and effective.
The primary goal of the law enforcement of child trafficking is to find the children who have been abducted and to protect their safety and freedom.
Second, the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment can be listed in many "grand words" from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
However, before the trafficking case was broken, it was necessary to pay attention to the victim's personal safety.
It depends on the importance and urgency of the topic. Under the urgent "search and rescue" purpose, topics such as "whether or not to impose the death penalty on the sale of children" are controversial and controversial. However, the rescue of the abducted child cannot wait.
According to the experience of the investigation of such cases, human traffickers are usually away from the scene of the crime as soon as they get their hands on it.
Each minute of delay in the investigation of the case will lead to one step further away from the parents.
In this case, it is a practical action to take measures such as the "Union" platform to directly help solve cases and find children.
After all, it is a big task to operate the entire legal system to do a good job in "child trafficking."
In order to combat crime, protect the rights and interests of children and parents, and ensure the careful implementation of the "protection of weak children", we need to improve legislation, judicial protection, and law enforcement.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be done better from family to society.
For example, a common case is that a family of three is resting at the station, and the parents are sleeping. When they wake up, they find that their child has disappeared.
It is not expected that a two-year-old child has sufficient self-protection skills, but as the parent of a young child, you should at least have the awareness of protection.
The minimum means to prevent children from being abducted are that both parents take turns to rest or that the child is placed under safe protection.
From the other side of the police to combat the crime of trafficking in children, the buyer side should also be concerned and punished.
The single illegal act is often only one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, the minimum penalty for the crime of kidnapping children is five years; for particularly serious cases, the minimum penalty may be death, and the property shall be confiscated.
The starting point is high and the maximum penalty is heavy. In the light of the general trend of "lightening the penalty", the crime of child trafficking is obviously a crime with a heavy penalty.
There are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward ideas about raising children and lack legal awareness.
The legal education of this part of the people should be synchronized with the progress.
It is not enough for the government to strictly enforce the law.
If the market for buying and selling children is widespread, the traffickers are greedy for money, constantly innovate the means of trafficking, and form a situation of "competition" with law enforcement, the anti-trafficking operation will inevitably become inefficient.
Therefore, breaking through the backward concept, popularizing legal knowledge, and also helping to eradicate the crime of kidnapping and buying children.
Yang Hongdong preaches the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the provincial party conference
From the history of the 100 years of the Party's struggle, we can draw strength
Hunan Daily News, December 10 (reported by Gong Boxwei: According to the unified arrangement of the provincial party committee, on the morning of December 10, Yang Houdong, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, delivered an interactive lecture at the Ma栏 video creative park, studied and implemented the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress, studied and implemented the spirit of the important instructions and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping to Hunan Province, and studied and implemented the spirit of the 12th CPC National Congress.
Yang Hongdong used his personal experience and understanding to interpret the essence and requirements of the spirit of the CPC Central Committee from three aspects, namely, ideals and beliefs, self-improvement and the Youth Big Party, and Party leaders and Party theory.
He pointed out that it is necessary to combine the spirit of the full meeting and the important instructions and comments of General Secretary Xi Jinping on the important speech delivered by General Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party Congress, and integrate the spirit of the provincial party congress, so as to enhance the self-awareness, political awareness and action awareness of safeguarding the “two确立” and achieving the “two guarantees”, and unswervingly move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
In the interactive exchange section, the representatives of grass-roots cadres, enterprises and young people asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of the " Two Establishments," how to grasp the direction of cultural enterprises, and how to draw strength from the 100-year history of the Party's history in the new era.

The International Olive Oil Council classifies olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil and lampante olive oil or refined olive oil.
The first-press olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is obtained from fresh olive fruit after mechanical cold pressing, filtration, and other treatments to remove impurities.
According to the different acidity, it can be divided into three grades:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: This is the highest grade and quality of olive oil. It is a natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity is not more than 1%.
Excellent virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): slightly acidic, not more than 2%, pure and fragrant.
Normal virgin olive oil (Ordinary Virgin): The taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity is not more than 3.3%.
The refined olive oil is the olive oil refined after the acidity exceeds 3.3% of the crude olive oil, or become the "second oil".
The refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Normal olive oil (Olive Oil): The refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of crude olive oil to adjust the taste and color, and its acidity is less than 1.5%, and it is transparent and golden yellow.
Refined olive oil or olive pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): This is olive oil extracted from the oil cake by dissolving and refined.
After reading the classification, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is an important index.
You should know that the olive fruit is like the grapes used to make wine. Olive fruits from different areas and different olive fruit varieties will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best growing area of olive:
The Mediterranean region has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for the growth of olive trees.
In addition to the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be scattered.
Main production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, as well as countries with similar climates such as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and so on, are far south of the equator.
The harvesting month of olive:
The olive tree blooms and bears fruit from March to June every year, and the fruit develops and matures from July to October. The fruit changes from green to red, purple, and finally black.
The harvest season is from November to February next year.
The nutritional composition of olive oil:
Olive oil contains rich monounsaturated fatty acids, including oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition so far.
At the end of the summit, Biden said that the flame of freedom would never be extinguished
The online "Democracy Summit" (Summit for Democracy) convened by US President Biden and attended by leaders of government and civil society and the private sector from 110 countries ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing speech, Biden said that the flame of freedom was burning in the hearts of all people in the world, and the authoritarian regime could never extinguish it.
He also said that the plan is to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Representatives of the Taiwan government and the State Councilor, Tang Feng, and the Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, Law Chi-kwong, who are currently in exile in Britain, also delivered speeches at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work ahead is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because I have said before that as this summit shows, the democratic world is everywhere.
The authoritarian regime can never extinguish the flame of freedom. It burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said: "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, and better resist the缓冲 and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who want to pursue power before the public interest. "
The second day of the "Democratic Summit" focused on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with the "International Human Rights Day".
In his opening speech on the same day, Secretary-General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially the challenges brought about by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "It is time to reiterate our common values and positions and the resilience of democracy.
This requires deepening the social dialogue, solving the problem of inequality, combating corruption, updating the social contract, investing in high-quality education, and expanding the opportunities of women and girls.
This also requires resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including all tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Luo Ganrong, a Hong Kong human rights activist, delivered a speech via pre-recorded video at the summit, calling on participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's ethnic minorities, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "Long time ago, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Luo Guanzhong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't realize the threat of the Communist Party of China to our democratic values.
This is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason why we must change. "
At the round table discussion on “fighting against digital authoritarianism and affirming the values of democracy”, Taiwan Executive Yuan Mainland Affairs Councilor Tang Feng issued the “National Declaration” through video, stressing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and despotism.
He also shared his experience in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "In the early days of Taiwan's democracy, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, the authoritarian governments in all parts of the world justified the violations of human rights on the grounds of public health and collective interests, and the global democratic trend showed signs of retreat.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to close the city to control the epidemic, and we do not have to withdraw to defeat fake information. "
At the same time as the second day of the "Democratic Summit", the US Treasury announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, which were found to have serious human rights violations, and also imposed investment restrictions on a company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations in China.

I know.
But the restaurant did not know why it was constantly delaying the delivery time
It was originally #NUMBER#

I don't eat.
I will definitely complain
You can't send it, why didn't you say it earlier
Waiting for you for so long
No, I didn't get the call

Why not cancel
Hello, the restaurant's spicy chicken is alive
I want to try tennis, but I am afraid that I will not stick to it. So I want to find a similar price to practice.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendship. If you can't distinguish, then the normal price of the expensive one is more friendly than that of the cheap one. Such "entry-level cameras" are actually industrial garbage.
Their strength is very low. The ball hits the racket, and the vibration is very large. The hard ball cannot withstand. It is very difficult for high level players to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult that you know you will not learn, and you know you will not be willing to buy expensive ones to fool you, and you will not play twice, so that this racket is cheap, and you do not feel sorry for it.
When you can really distinguish good and bad, you have progressed, and come to me to buy expensive things, I will make twice as much money.
It is recommended to buy a second-hand good quality racket at a similar price. Choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so the good rackets are not worth the price. A new racket with a price of RMB 500 or 600 is enough. A second-hand 200 is not worth the price of a thousand yuan?
It is friendly to beginners, but it is useless after the beginner stage, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the beginner stage.
The order has been delayed several times.
Can you help follow up?
Delay
Thank you.
That is to say, in fact, I already have credit?
Next, do I need to reorder? Didn't I ignore that order?

In fact, there are many rules for dressing for girls with a slight body.
Girls who are overweight should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length should be about knee-high, and the skirt should just cover the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, the fat on the legs will be exposed.
If it is too long, it will give the impression of being short and fat.
If you wear it in three sections, it will make you appear taller naturally. The colors should be different for the top, skirt and hose, so as to produce a slender effect.
In fact, many deep colors are the standard equipment of fat girls (which the author has deep experience), and deep colors are also a good way to hide your body fat. The elegant black short skirt is also the preferred choice of fat girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially black skirts, will make you look thinner.
If your legs are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too much.
The more popular the Vietnamese are, the less vivid the colors should be.
So that when people pay attention to your legs and feet, they don't get fat.
For girls who are slightly overweight, there are some tips for dressing up.
Underweight girls should not wear tight short skirts. The top should not be too short or put in the skirt. It will make people uncomfortable to see. If the legs are thick, you should wear black long socks or mesh socks (the kind with the small grid). Choose a soft printed喇叭 skirt and a loose shirt. It can well hide the shortcomings of the fat girl.
Of course, there are also rules for fat girls when they wear shorts.
When a fat girl wears a skirt, she should choose a shirt that matches the color of the skirt, so that her fat body can increase height.
The combination of a short skirt and high heels can make your legs appear longer, which is the most fashionable combination in the summer!
If you are fat in the upper body but thin in the legs, you should choose a glamorous short dress.
It can not only cover the belly, but also show your advantages.
The A-line skirt is very slimming. It is suitable for girls who are fat. The top should be selected to be tight. It will be more slimming.
A simple white T-shirt and shorts can be tried by a fat woman.
Fat girls can also wear fashionable clothes.
As long as you can master the rules of clothing combination, then the girls with a little fat will also be the focus of attention.
After changing the way of dressing, we should also increase physical activity in our daily lives and strive to get rid of the label of being overweight girls as soon as possible.

Girls shoot arrows at each other as targets for their sisters: "Thought it was a flesh wound, but it's okay" - Xinhua
In the square of Wulin, Hangzhou, a girl stood in front of a big wooden board, on which was written the words "human target, 10 yuan per arrow".
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl donating as a 'arrow target' to her sister" broke the circle of friends.
The photo shows that a girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stands in front of a big wooden board, on which is written the words "Man's meat target, 10 yuan per arrow", indicating that the passerby can use the bow and arrow to shoot after paying.
This behavior attracted the attention of netizens.
Yesterday evening, the publicity director of the South District of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed the girl's extreme action after confirming that she was collecting money for her sister, but such behavior was not worthy of promotion. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
The girl was warned about the "arrow target" donation in the street.
In the pictures circulating on the web, a girl with long hair is standing in front of a large wooden board, on which is written the words "man meat target, 10 yuan a arrow" in black ink, and another wooden board with her bank account and WeChat and Alipay accounts.
The picture has caused controversy online.
Some netizens believed that this was a “begging behavior for attention”, and many netizens showed sympathy.
We found the situation when we patrolled by the square around 10:00 am on the 23rd. At that time, the crowd of onlookers was already quite large. "
When asked by the local media about the incident, the officer of the Tianhaiguan police station said that there were two girls who were selling things on the street. Both of them were around 20 years old and looked pretty.
Among them, the girl who was made a "human cannonball" was crying and asking passersby to play the game; another girl was helping to yell, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery fees, and asking people to help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting donations for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the publicity director of the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Jijia Li, and she was raising funds for her sister Jijia Yan.
However, due to the need for more than 300,000 yuan in treatment, it was not possible to find a good way to solicit donations at that time.
He said that during the whole process, the two girls were targets and helpers, but they were not involved in it, and no one shot arrows during the whole process, but people watched and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After the police were examined by the public security department, the bow and arrow used by the police did not fall under the scope of control.
The person in charge said, "It is not recommended to adopt this eye-catching donation method."
After being warned by the police, she has left the police station.

What is the most popular in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, an article titled "Quick Look! Project Manager Can Strike Gold in Olympic Projects" was very popular, which mentioned that project managers can take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: Moving bricks, traveling, and working overtime are the daily routine of project managers, and fighting fires, taking blame, and apologizing are not difficult.
Although this article seems to be a joke, it also reflects the daily hardships of project managers, and represents the inability of current project management work.
Those who work in project management have gradually chosen some actions to get rid of their work difficulties.
From the number of people applying for the PMP (the international qualification for project management professionals) each year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to enhance their project management capabilities.
According to the "Report on the Development of China's Project Management in the Twenty Years: 1999-2019," as of September 2019, the total number of people who have applied for the PMP® in China is nearly 600,000, the number of people who have passed the PMP® certification is about 420,000, and the number of people with valid certificates is about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificates in the world.
Over the past decade, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which indicates that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer possible to do things by simply copying the "old experience" of the past. The ever-changing working environment has made us know that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of giants to explore the way forward.
However, can PMP certification guarantee smooth project management?
Many project management beginners said that by learning the related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the related knowledge points such as the ten fields and five process groups of project management, but when they actually carry out the project management work, they are still in a state of ignorance.
Many project managers often report the following problems: Project management awareness is not enough, relying only on personal experience, only having project management theories, and not knowing how to practice; There is a lack of systematic project management process and system support, which cannot be implemented in work, project estimation is not accurate, the control is not sensitive, and the project is delayed again and again; Members are not clearly divided, and the "old guys" in the team do not know how to deal with cross-department cooperation and communication, which makes the project difficult to advance...
Therefore, for more than 10 years, it has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other key personnel in research and development, and has won the title of the "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base". With the online course of the "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp".
The online course of "Manager Training for Research and Development Projects" This is a way of online fragmentation learning that combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many research and development companies to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard movements of project managers and take the next step in your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers at a lower cost and with less investment, so as to bring more efficient operation results to enterprises.
It is not possible to have words of evidence. It is better to have a look at how other students evaluate the course: This course is not only conducted by the expert team of Central China University of Science and Technology (the former Huawei R&D management team), but also combined with the international advanced project management methodology and many real business scenarios of famous enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich templates and forms, to help students transform the learning content into specific work after class.

JCB encourages consumers to make rational consumption on the eve of the "12th" - economic observer - professional financial news website
The total transaction amount of the country's online payment business during this year's "Double Eleventh" festival reached 177 billion yuan, a new high compared with previous years.
The variety of coupon redemptions and live shopping broadcasts have once again benefited consumers, and this consumer boom has not only made people wonder about the increasingly strong consumer power of the Chinese people, but also forced them to think about the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer groups in the contemporary society.
On the eve of the "12th", JX Finance Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "JX Finance") issued a rational consumption recommendation, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption consciousness and consumption habits, and to refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
On the whole, the performance of China's residents in the field of financial consumption is better, but there are large differences in their financial behavior and skills, and the level of basic financial knowledge needs to be further improved.
The financial literacy of the elderly and young people is relatively low. The "old and young" will still be the key objects of financial education. The "China Youth Debt Report" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance showed that the young generation has great consumption potential. Credit consumption has become an important way of consumption upgrade. 86.6% of young people are using credit products. Nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the young generation is generally showing a rational consumption trend, it is far from the "over-spending" label attached to it by the outside world, but some young people do exist excessive consumption, following the trend of consumption, and thus have too large financial pressure and debt risks, and even cause social problems to gradually increase. Financial enterprises should be willing to shoulder social responsibilities and carry out positive guidance.

Vietnam News Network - Gulf Cooperation Council to face common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first time that Mohammed bin Salman has visited Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in 2017, which led to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
The diplomatic tension has seriously affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and has had negative impacts on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, and the Gulf countries signed a deal with the United States and Kuwait to move towards "stability and unity".
Saudi Arabia reopened the border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading the efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states resolved their differences and restored relations with Qatar out of the need to unite for the interests of all countries and regional stability, with the aim of addressing common challenges.
During the visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf countries.
The 725 km long channel connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of the two countries.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries have signed 13 cooperation memorandums of understanding with a value of $300 billion.
The visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to the Gulf countries coincided with the negotiations between Iran and the world’s major countries on the rescue of the Iran nuclear agreement - the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was denounced by the Gulf countries because they believed that it could not solve the Iranian missile issue.
All Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
All Gulf countries believe that without solving the Iranian missile problem and taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region, there is a defect.
In the context of the failure of the major countries and Iran nuclear negotiations to meet the wishes of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted direct negotiations.
Its goal is to prevent the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that slow down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council Summit will be the first summit of Gulf Cooperation Council countries since the end of some member states' dispute with Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess its diplomatic achievements in promoting the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council while proposing measures to make its member states fully cooperate to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is claimed that the exhaust sound of the new area is the largest!
This time, the team brought this car to many men.
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor of Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The price is nearly two million Malaysian ringgits, the road tax is Malaysian ringgits a year, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, how fast can you imagine?
Well, I don't know. According to the data, acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h takes only 2.9 seconds, which is about the time it takes my car to reach 30 km/h.
The low, bulky body, the rakish coupe doors, the huge intake on all four wheels, and the unobstructed view of the 6.5-liter V12 engine below the glass all perfectly reflect the style of Lamborghini.
For the description of the model, you don't need to say much, just Google it yourself. Here are some explanations that Google may not provide!
It's too much attention. Wherever you go, everyone is watching. It's not comfortable!
The cost of 1km of oil is about RM1 (the car owner does not care)
It is necessary to practice the posture of getting on and off the bus, otherwise it will be a little embarrassing (because it will climb out of the bus and then get stuck in half)
The engine sound is too loud, and you will immediately be deafened when you get off the car. (But it is still very enjoyable)
The car is too big, and it will be very narrow to stop in a normal parking space. I am afraid that I will be hit by the car next to me when it opens the door!
I'm a little lonely because there are no rivals on the road (I talk about myself, not about the owner, hahaha)
Don't misunderstand, this video's supercar is not for sale, sorry!

Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits accumulated over the course of the development of a university, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has played an important role in the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, the university has assumed a unique mission different from that of other social organizations. For my country's universities, it has emerged in the autumn of national danger, and its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes in times. It advocates the value concept of "brightening the world and improving the country" and the responsibility of patriotism.
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is increasingly obvious. Global education competition, scientific and technological competition and talent competition are constantly intensifying. The structural reform of higher education as an important "supply side" is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the introduction of the "General Plan for Promoting the Construction of World Class Universities and World Class Disciplines" has shown China's confidence and determination to move from a large country in higher education to a powerful country in higher education. At the same time, it has also put forward higher and more demanding requirements for the development of universities.
How can we strive to join the ranks of the world's leading universities in a short period of time, accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a group of world-class disciplines, and achieve "overstepping the curve"?
In addition to having a firm goal confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the advantages of later development, by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents from overseas, learning from the advanced experiences of world-class universities, and achieving significant improvements in academic level and teaching quality; second, the cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom of the Chinese civilization accumulated over the past five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional cultures, and thus uniting strength, shaping brands and enhancing the image; third, the advantages of the system, giving full play to the superiority of the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, strengthening the goal drive, gathering the consensus force, optimizing the allocation of resources, and providing a sustainable solid guarantee for the school to accelerate its pace of catching up with the world's advanced level.
It is particularly important to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university in the same way, and each school must show its personality and characteristics while playing its role.
The characteristics of the school should not only have the characteristics of Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique goals, traditions and resource endowments of each school.
As for Zhejiang University, we attach importance to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in our education: One is to highlight the characteristics of innovative entrepreneurship talent training, build an integrated educational environment of education and industry, and form an all-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; the other is to highlight the characteristics of cross-disciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, create a system environment of cross-disciplinary convergence, and actively cultivate cross-disciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark cross-disciplinary results; the third is to highlight the characteristics of the educational system and social service, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a cross-Zhejiang University production, study and research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university can resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of “seeking truth through innovation”, the common values of “working hard, cultivating virtue, distinguishing truth from falsehood, and being down-to-earth”, and the common values of “embracing rivers and lakes, opening up new things and people, and developing our country” have jointly formed the latest expression system of Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of education and continuously accumulate cultural height and spirit strength. It is rich in connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, " <v>Haina Jianghu</v> " emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflects the spirit of "using all the talents in the world", and shows how to absorb the excellent ideas of world-renowned universities in running schools and educating people; "启真厚德" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and perfection, which means that universities should not only pursue truth, but also cultivate virtue and temperament; "opening up the country to the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the spirit of seeking new knowledge, scientific research innovation, and reform and development, and reform and innovation; "building my country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always be with the national destiny.
These series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits are the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
"Smart people listen to the silence, and wise people see the shape of the future".
It is necessary for Chinese colleges and universities to further grasp the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply understand the position and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of becoming a world-class university.
At the same time, we must uphold humanistic care and independent freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the national spirit intertwine, and provide endless impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national revitalization and the realization of the common ideal of the human race.

At the same time, the crypto community has emerged with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in the Southeast Asian region. Some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic began to get a steady income in this game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based pet养成 game that combines NFT and other methods. It is currently the highest transaction NFT project with more than 3 billion US dollars.
According to data from TokenTerminal, Axie Infinity has a daily income of more than 8.2 million US dollars, which is close to that of "Battle Royale".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" has spread a new "palytoearn" mode to more people. Through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer single roles. In addition to enjoying the fun and economic benefits of the game, players can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity does not come from the game developers, but from the blockchain technology.
When I saw a news about my friend's stock price, my biggest impression is that enterprises should choose the right track, that is to say, the right industry to invest in. First of all, they should choose a growth space industry with a market size of at least 100 billion. Secondly, they should choose an industry with good growth prospects in the future. Thirdly, they should choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and the flatness of the track refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
To the right track!
The first thing to do in the new year is to summarize the 2021 adjustment of the 2022 tactical layout.
The strategy is to "do the things right", that is, to do the things right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing", which is to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find the direction. The tactics are to land. There is a strategic thinking space above most of the tactical thinking.
For example, how can we increase the number of customers (tactical thinking) above, can we think about whether we should continue to deepen the current field or expand the field horizontally (strategic thinking); for example, how can we increase the customer retention rate (tactical thinking) above, can we think about how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); above, can we consider how to set the correct KPI for activities, achieve the correct activity goals, such as increasing the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; above, can we consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
After 12 years, Bitcoin has reached several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the Central American small country of El Salvador designated Bitcoin as the legal currency, which was the first time that Bitcoin became the legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities and Exchange Commission for the first time approved the launch of the Bitcoin ETF by ProShares and its listing on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the arrival of the first legal Bitcoin futures ETF on the US capital market and the expansion of the cryptocurrency investment opening.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian American group complains about discrimination in Yale and other three Ivy League universities - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Washington D.C., May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei): More than 130 Asian American groups filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, accusing three Ivy League colleges - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College - of discrimination in the admissions process.
The Asian Educational Alliance, which initiated the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yuanyuan, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the conditions for admission to US colleges and universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asian applicants in these three US colleges and universities has basically maintained the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities discriminate against Asian students in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" admissions process.
According to Zhao Yuxiang, in 2014, the study of Sanders and other scholars showed that in these three colleges and universities, the rate of admission of Asian students was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
According to the data of the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League colleges and universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest proportion of admissions of Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have actually implemented racial quotas for Asian students for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yu空告诉新华社记者，他们希望提交申诉后，美国教育部和司法部能够展开调查，并在认定事实后采取措施，阻止这些高校继续在招生中歧视亚裔。
They also expect that colleges and universities can take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies for Asians.
At present, the three colleges and universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian Educational Alliance was founded in 2015, when it complained of Harvard University's admissions discrimination, but the US Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the American Chinese groups participating in the appeal, there are also American Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the real estate agent that a factory was located in Zhaotun Town, Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province. After several visits to the site, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In the same month of December, Mr. Lu consulted with the family of the landowner on the details of the purchase of the factory and transferred 20 million yuan as a deposit through the bank on the same day.
As the payee, Lin signed the "Deposit Receipt for the Purchase of Factory Buildings", which stated that "if the buyer did not want to buy the factory buildings, the deposit was returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory buildings, the deposit was doubled and returned to the seller, and the parties agreed to sign a contract for the purchase and sale of factory buildings within one week."
However, the two sides could not reach a consensus on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, which led to the failure to sign the house sale contract.
Considering that the two sides could not reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned 20,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
After paying the deposit and making the down payment for the house, he was about to sign the contract when the seller refused to sell. This made Mr. Lu angry and helpless.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yizhou Municipal People's Court.
After the trial, the court found that the two parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, which cannot be solely attributed to the defendant, and should be reasonably assumed that the consultation was unsuccessful, so the case should not be applied to the penalty of double return of the deposit, and the defendant should not be liable for the default of double return of the deposit.
After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the second court of appeal upheld the original verdict.
<v>Lawyers remind</v> that you should exercise due diligence during the transaction process.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, you should perform the necessary due diligence duties, such as verifying the information of the owner of the property, whether the property is occupied, etc., and clearly stipulating the specific time and location of delivery in the contract in case of disputes during the performance of the contract.
After the conclusion of the "Democratic Summit" on Friday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman made a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Lead the People Summit" was "divided into ideological lines, politicized and weaponized, and used the name of fake democracy to carry out the real work of democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and transferring domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic reconstruction', abused unilateral sanctions, and fomented 'color revolutions', resulting in catastrophic consequences.
‘Democracy’ has long been a ‘massive weapon’ used by the US to interfere in other countries.
This summit is Biden's action to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held via video, and the leaders of 111 countries were invited to participate, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for the problems of its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices questioning the legitimacy of the summit in the international community and the United States. For example, some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, were invited to the summit. Some people doubt that the real intention of the Biden administration is not to promote democracy but to achieve geopolitical goals.
The new German Prime Minister, Angela Merkel, also participated in the video democracy summit
The statement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday said, "Today's American democracy is pathological, and the problems of money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social division, racial contradictions and class division are intensifying". American democracy is based on capitalism.
In his speech, US President Biden said, "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, and better resist the缓冲 and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who want to pursue power before the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not an assumption, "we must constantly update it in every generation, and I think this is a decisive challenge in our era. "
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "face persistent and worrying challenges, and democracy needs fighters to defend it".
The United States promised to launch a one-year action plan after the summit, including a $4.244 billion initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that all countries will make concrete public commitments before the 2022 real democratic summit to improve their democratic systems.
Biden said, "Let us all implement our commitments and report our progress next year."

What is the drinking method of red whiskies?
Everyone's hobbies are different. Some people like to collect, some people like to eat, and of course some people like to drink. Red label whisky is one of the most popular Scottish whiskies in various countries, and Red label whisky has also won the gold medal of the International Whisky Competition.
Each bottle of red wine has its unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, you are wasting it.
How to drink a red card whisky?
Here is a simple introduction for you.
Red Card Whisky Drinking:
Johnnie Walker Red Label Whisky is made up of about 35 types of Scottish whisky, with a strong aroma and traditional Scottish whisky characteristics, with a sweet and smoky aroma.
The entry is rich and fresh, with a hint of vanilla and strong smoke flavor.
The wine can be drunk directly with ice, or mixed with favorite drinks.
Red Card Whisky enters the country. In order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, Red Card Whisky + Coke or Soda or New Coke or other bubble drinks have become a fashionable style for a long time.
These sweet drinks can not only neutralize the acid taste, but also bring visual pleasure. They can be added to drinks to change the taste.
Red Card Whisky + Slice Lemon + Square Sugar (Sugar can also be used), is the most authentic and traditional drinking method.
The authentic red fang wine tastes a little sour. Adding sugar can neutralize the sourness. Lemon will bring a refreshing aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to the personal taste.
These three are the best ways to drink red whiskey. You can try them as a reference. Hope my introduction can help you.
Education Thinking: How to Make College Exams Work for “Studious” and “Studious” - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote letters to the school leaders, expressing their confusion about the university examination and their demands to increase the difficulty of the examination, change the type of the examination, and make the examination truly reflect the actual level of the students.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a "hot topic".
In the university campus, students come from all over the world, the ability level is different, and the learning level is different.
For a group with such diverse characteristics, it is inevitable to have different feelings about the assessment.
Of course, if the test questions are single and the repetition rate is high, the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who are not hardworking may pass the exam by突击 studying before the exam. If they want to achieve better results, they may try other methods.
As a result, there is the phenomenon of "poor students" passing the exam even though they do not put in much effort; and the phenomenon of "bright students" who do not even miss a single class, have excellent homework and notes, and their exams scores are not much higher than the average.
It seems that the problems reported by the students of LZUT are not without reason, and I believe that this situation is not limited to LZUT.
From this point of view, we should praise the three students who wrote directly.
In fact, people who have gone to college know that the phenomenon of突击 preparing for the exam, trying various methods to "borrow" the exam questions from the teacher, striving to draw the exam scope, and seeking "special guidance" before the exam is not uncommon, and even in the case of taking notes in the exam and asking the teacher for mercy after the exam.
In my opinion, as a measure of the quality of teaching, judging the qualifications of a university's examination is more important for the comprehensive understanding of teachers of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific命题 based on this basis.
At the undergraduate stage of university, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are mainly based on basic knowledge.
It is undeniable that whether you fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a discipline is the content of the university examination.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theories and basic常识 of the disciplines. From the perspective of knowledge points, there is little change. It is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, "20 years ago, the basic knowledge of university mathematics was studied, and it is still the key. "
But the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test types are single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, the examination is generally composed of a group of examiners, and then the senior teachers of the disciplines coordinate the composition of the examination papers, and the examination marking is also carried out by all the teachers who are responsible for the subject, so as to partially overcome the repetition of the examination.
However, in order to design a set of practical tests that conform to the actual teaching and learning situation, the difficulty of the questions is normally distributed, and it is necessary to integrate the teaching situation, comprehensively analyze the level of student learning, and thus the design of the test can have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and types of questions, so as to highlight the examination of basic knowledge and ability to assess, and at the same time, the type of innovation design.
The examination is the guiding star of university education. What kind of examination students have corresponding preparation plans. In the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
In response to the letter of the students, the school of Lhasa Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it and has already deployed a plan for rectification.
It requires the teaching units to organize teachers to carry out the discussion and the comparison of the course examination, formulate the examination papers and related systems, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination papers and the examination of the comprehensive evaluation of the course teaching.
It is necessary to solve the problems of single types of tests and repetition of questions from the mechanism point of view. Of course, corresponding systems need to be put in place. However, the key lies in the daily work, and teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only mastering the teaching content, but also mastering the student's learning situation. The two sides should be mastered, and the teaching and learning will be better matched, forming a benign interaction, and the examination will be more in line with the actual situation, so that the “master” and “slave” can get what they deserve.

Kim夫人婚纱摄影（南街店）暂时还没有分店
Before the photo, we changed the time twice because of our unorganized time. The consultant Lan Lan was very patient to help us arrange the time.
He later chose a good weekend to shoot.
The staff of Princess Jin's is excellent, whether they are consultants, makeup artists or photographers.
That was my first time to wear makeup. Wow, I can't believe it. I will become so pretty one day.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) are very patient in makeup and makeup is very natural.
The scene was filmed in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and I didn't feel cold. When I was photographed, the makeup artist occasionally paid attention to our clothes, headwear, and immediately helped us fix it.
The photographer is very humorous, and he feels very happy after taking pictures all day.
When choosing photos, because I have seen many cases on the Internet, I don't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we choose photos, we really don't want to add photos at all, just the 24 photos in the package, one by one (I heard that my cousin who took the wedding photos at the same time as me paid more than 7,000 yuan for the package, and I was shocked and afraid that I would choose too many photos)
Today, the picture was fixed. Lan Lan sent it to me. I looked at two pictures and thought they were not good. They immediately helped me to fix it.
Compared with her previous photos, I think our photos are really satisfied. Simple and fresh, just the style I want.
I highly recommend that you go to Chuanhan Golden Lady to take wedding photos!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Thank you so much for wishing me happiness and success!

The 3,200 newborn babies in Sabah did not receive the birth certificate due to the shortage of the special anti-counterfeit paper
(Yap 11 News) Sabah National Registration Bureau said that due to the exhaustion of the special counterfeit paper stock, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October, and so far, more than 3,200 people have been affected.
However, the Director of the Bureau, Keramimos, assured that all babies who had applied for the birth certificate had their data recorded in the system. When the counterfeit paper arrived next week, they would be issued again.
At the press conference, he explained the report of a website for more than 10 months on the printing problem of Sabah newspaper.
He said that the problem had appeared two months ago and Sarawak also faced the same problem.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers that produce special counterfeit papers are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed delivery to China.
He explained that the counterfeit paper used by the Sabah newspaper was different from that of other regions, so it could not be borrowed from other states' stocks.
Kallimannus revealed that the latest batch of counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on June 6, and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
The agency will send a team to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, and print the last stage in Sabah immediately. It is estimated that it can be delivered to the applicant by more than two working days (December 20).
We will notify the applicants to go to the various districts to collect the birth certificate. "
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 4801 newspapers so far this year.
Waiting for more than 7 hours
Is it coming soon?
I mean food
I'm waiting on the other side of #PRS_ORG#
OK, thanks, because the restaurant said it was ready

48 hours of negative nucleic acid and setting up a "buffer zone" The Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China issued a notice requiring the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control at the port city - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in ports and cities, requiring that people who have recently left ports and cities on land borders (excluding Hong Kong and Macau with ports) must hold a negative result of nucleic acid tests within 48 hours. People who go to ports and cities on land borders after arriving must undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date of the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities determining the scope of the port city and announcing it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that the port city with conditions may study the establishment of a buffer zone for epidemic prevention and control in its jurisdiction.
The relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area. The two sides have frequent exchanges of border people.
The differentiated management policy has been implemented, and the first line of defense against the spillover of the epidemic has been replaced by two lines of defense, which is expected to achieve the forward movement of the epidemic prevention and control gates, reduce the risk of the epidemic spreading outside, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local clusters in China, all of which have been imported from overseas.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as the lack of timely monitoring and early warning of the epidemic, the lack of implementation of the closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, the formality of periodic nucleic acid tests, the lack of disinfection of the cold chain, the lack of scientific and precise emergency handling of the epidemic, etc.
The notice requires that we should make great efforts in nine aspects, such as improving the epidemic prevention mechanism of the port city, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, in order to speed up the improvement of the epidemic prevention mechanism of the port city, improve the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implement border control measures, so as to do a good job in epidemic prevention and control and strengthen the external prevention and control line.
The notice stressed that the cities at ports should synchronize the prevention and control of the epidemic with the protection of people's livelihoods, release and open the hotline for the protection of people's livelihoods, regularly check the potential risks of the supply and price of basic living supplies, and solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reported by the masses.
According to the notice, the ports cities referred to include open land, water and air ports, as well as counties (municipalities, districts and flags), cities (districts and states) and cities (provinces, autonomous regions and alliances) where the ports are located. The specific scope is determined and announced by the provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

The oil tube video reveals the truth of the US military's 20 years of bloody killings - Xinhuanet
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Gun Machine" on the oil platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States invading Afghanistan under the guise of "counter-terrorism", forcibly exporting American democracy through war, and committing all kinds of human rights violations for 20 years.
Using unmanned aerial vehicles to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distort human nature, and set up a killing team.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up a "black prison" to subject suspects to various torture and humiliation.
Human rights violations have triggered more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorist" war is "anti-terrorist".
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a country full of wounds and countless killings and destruction.
Watch the video to uncover the truth about the United States using the pretext of "counter-terrorism" and its bloody killings, as well as the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Unintentionally, I saw the following article. From the perspective of business and the preservation period, why does this customer want to use the logistics company in the customs area to do the canning? Although the canning belongs to the deep processing, it does not belong to the scope of business of the customs logistics company. This text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I have visited many奶粉 manufacturers and touched many奶粉 production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the powdered milk are the same as those of the powdered milk, and there is no difference between them.
So everyone must ask: Why is the shelf life of the bagged product one year, while that of the bulk product is two years or longer?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between bulk and bulk so large?
In fact, many consumers or mothers believe that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality is much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the expensive ones are good.
Some consumers also said that the taste or smell of the canned food was different!
Now I will tell you about the reason for the high price of bottled water. Where is the high price?
Why is the difference so large in the raw materials?
Because when the manufacturer sets the price, most of them have considered that if the price of the bag is too high, it will be difficult for the consumer to accept, which means that the manufacturer will generate low profits or no profits, so how does the manufacturer survive?
Therefore, they have a large increase in the price of the container to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers are promoting bulk, not bulk.
And you want so many manufacturers to spend millions or even billions of dollars on advertising every year, where is the cost?
Everyone can imagine.
With the development of society and the promotion costs of the market, such as the promotional personnel of the market, the display costs of the market, the product gift costs, the advertising costs and so on, are also increasing.
Therefore, all the manufacturers are also constantly increasing new products, and these products are in bulk, and their prices are also constantly increasing. In fact, this is a new product with increased market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, their increased cost of raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan.
Some brands resort to any means to promote their products, tie up with doctors in hospitals, and ask them to assist in the promotion of the products, with a profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan from each listening.
However, China's relevant laws and regulations are absolutely not allowed to carry out such operating methods and methods. In fact, this practice is in the interests of consumers.
It is suggested that people buy powdered milk in a container when there is a container at home, so as to save costs and increase the storage and sealing properties of the powdered milk, and there is no effect on the baby.
And don't think that the shelf life of the bulk is longer than that of the package. If the shelf life of the bulk is the same as that of the package after opening the package, it is just that the package is difficult to store and easy to become moist and spoiled after opening the package.
The food was cold and hard, and I couldn't eat it.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhuanet
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the boom of books on success.
The books on success today are mostly about the "principle of the best" -- that is, assuming or implying that you can "do it", and then telling you what you need to do.
It is equivalent to saying that they have jumped over the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
For this reason, these books have a common feature — — either work hard to the best of your ability, or just do nothing at all; or 100, or 0; or climb Mount Tai, or just stay put.
This "optimal principle" makes everyone recognize that it is "absolutely correct", but 99% of people will be frightened at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "taking resolute decisions to make a 180-degree turn," which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who are inflexible, conservative, and refuse to change, you have to shout at him, "You must change", which is undoubtedly self-delusion and playing the fool.
The vast majority of people will be timid and reluctant before the two words "change", and they will not be able to make up their minds; or they will make up their minds to change at a moment's notice, and take the first step boldly, but it will not last long, and they will not be able to maintain it for a long time.
Mr. Ma's famous sketch "From Tomorrow" is the classic expression of this "common human nature".
The biggest problem of the "Principle of the Best" is that the threshold is too high, which often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, making the majority of people "happy to see the door".
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way to make more ordinary people relatively successful.
The core of the "second best principle" is to reduce the threshold - it encourages a theory of "small wins becoming big wins", that is, if you can't do 100, you can do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0. If you can't climb Mount Tai, you can climb your neighbor's little sand dune, because that is always better than standing still.
In general, whatever you do is better than nothing.
Since the threshold has been greatly reduced, it is more likely for ordinary people to achieve perseverance, and the probability of success will also increase.
It is just a bit longer than the path of success following the principle of "second best."
In short, although the "optimal principle" is superficially aimed at making everyone successful, it can actually inspire a small number of people; while the "sub-optimal principle" can effectively inspire more people and benefit more people as much as possible.

The amount of Qinghai Lake裸鲤 resources increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporter Lu Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results showed that the amount of Qinghai Lake裸鲤 resources increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 10.85 million tons. Compared with the initial protection in 2002, the cumulative growth has exceeded 40 times.
The common name of the Qinghai Lake裸鲤 is "Tan fish". It is a valuable species of fish in Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the security of the ecological chain of water, fish and birds in the Qinghai Lake basin and biodiversity.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to the influence of human large-scale hunting and the degradation of the裸鲤 breeding area, the number of Qinghai Lake裸鲤 has sharply decreased. In 2002, the resource potential of Qinghai Lake裸鲤 was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake裸鲤 was listed as endangered species in the China Species Red List.
Since 2003, the Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of the lake and the breeding of fish, prohibiting any unit, collective and individual from Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake to catch the naked carp, and prohibiting the sale of the naked carp and its products.
At the same time, measures such as artificial reproduction release, cleaning the main rivers that enter the Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "passage for fish" have continued to be strengthened, and the resource potential of Qinghai Lake裸鲤 has increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, nearly 180 million Qinghai Lake裸鲤 have been artificially reproduced and released, and the contribution rate to the recovery of Qinghai Lake裸鲤 resources has exceeded 23%.
The Three Rivers Source Region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source area in China and even in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Gorges Source area and the waters of the Qinghai Lake and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued notices on the prohibition of fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, and built a "one river, one river and one lake" comprehensive prohibition and management system.

I just saw a piece of writing about the menstrual cycle, it was too long.
For men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first menstrual period between the ages of 13 and 15, and will go into menopause around the age of 50.
After that, it will come once a month.
But it is not a rule that can be precisely predicted. It is about a week's difference. It needs to be prepared in advance. Sometimes bad luck will also happen (suddenly a few days before).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of menstrual pain are different from person to person. Some people have pain for three days, while others have pain for a week. Some people have little effect, while others are so painful that they have to be sent to the hospital by ambulance. The pain of menstrual pain will change over time, and the pain before the pain does not mean that it will never hurt.
The menstrual flow cannot be controlled, and there is continuous bleeding for 24 hours from the beginning to the end. The only way to prevent the flow of blood to the clothes and chairs is to suck the blood with sanitary pads or tampons.
The main reason for menstrual pain is the secretion of prostaglandins. It is effective to take ibuprofen as soon as possible when the menstrual pain begins. It is useless to take it later.
During the menstrual period, due to the hyperemia of the uterus and the excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If you suddenly have diarrhea around your period, it is likely that you will have your period within two days.
The sanitary napkin should be changed every two or three hours. Otherwise, it is easy to breed bacteria. In addition to sleeping time, the worst case is to change six times a day, seven days a month, that is, 42 pieces. If you add the advance preparation, it may be 50 pieces. It is not used every month.
(Here is a modification: the tampon can be used for about 5-6 hours, and can last up to 8 hours.)
The hormones in the menstrual period may cause more aggression, and the hormones in the ovulation period may also cause emotional instability because of the changes in the body. It is very unfortunate that the body gives itself a thorn.
But the official crime rate data can show that women's ability to control emotions is very high, and they will not find excuses for emotional problems.
It is not only blood that flows, but also the detached uterine mucosa.
After the menstrual period, the uterine mucosa is the thinnest, and then gradually thickens, which can be understood as that the uterus is a house, and the house is built (the mucosa thickens) every month to prepare for the guests, but the guests do not come, and all the houses are demolished (the menstrual mucosa is discharged) the next month, and the cycle continues.
The menstrual cycle is inconvenient. For decades, it has been bleeding for 24 hours a few days a month, and it also causes abdominal pain and back pain. Who wants it?
But people are born because their mothers have been menstruating. Menstruation is to prepare a 10-month house for you when you first come to this world. We should thank our mothers for their regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things were suppressed for women, and the society brainwashed women that they were dirty and shameful, and everyone thought so, but times have changed.
If someone thinks that menstruation is disgusting, and that the body of a woman makes preparations for the birth of a life, they should not say it in public. Girls stand up and don't think like that. Men who have never experienced it, who will never experience it, and who don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful and disrespectful. How can you face your mother and want your children?
Finally, the sisters tried the tampons, and they really worked.
Today is the winter solstice festival. It is disappointing to send the wrong
We have to order another meal for the children.
It is hoped that the store will check the quality of the products in its spare time
Does the foot bath basin cause numbness?
It is important to choose a suitable foot bath basin to have a good effect of foot treatment and health. Today, Guomei's editor will answer this question and help you.
With the increasing awareness of people's health, the foot bath basin is becoming more and more popular with consumers, and there are a large number of products of different grades on the market, from more than RMB100 to more than RMB1,000, which gives consumers a great choice space.
According to the relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of health appliances such as foot baths are hot, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there is a certain safety risk.
"Swimming in water with electricity is really dangerous!"
Mr. Li told the reporter that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but when his father was bathing his feet, he felt numb.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt the numbness in his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pencil, and the electric pencil lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was charged.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was good. Although he withdrew the foot bath basin, Mr. Li still felt dissatisfied.
Because he found that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation for the foot bath basin that had been popular for a long time in terms of the setting of the highest temperature, the applicable population, and the materials that are guaranteed to be harmless.
However, in general, foot baths are unlikely to have problems with electricity, but it is not excluded that some products are not strictly controlled at the factory.
Therefore, when buying, choose a split bath.
The separation of water and electricity has no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take the electric pencil to measure.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opened - Viewpoint Top News - Hunan Daily Network - Huachuang Online
On December 10, Hunan Daily News (by Zhang Shangwu, Hu盼盼, Liu Xiaoling, photo Li Jian): This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and the promotion meeting of Xinhua Red Tea were held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center. The exhibition of the tea industry, the innovation of tea technology, the promotion of tea culture and the acceleration of the goal of the billion tea industry were held.
Hu Youxia, deputy director of the General Council of the All-China Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives, and Ye Hongbo, deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of lake red is in Xinyu, and the rise of red tea is a new impetus for "five colors of Hunan tea."
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the billion-yuan Xiang tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "three Xiang, four water and five color tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation. Green tea, black tea and red tea are the main tea types. The main production areas have promoted the integration of tea travel, leading the vast majority of tea farmers to increase income.
风水轮流转，红茶又发力。
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after harvesting green tea, they harvested red tea and black tea. Farmers had income all year round, and the output value of the tea plantation increased sharply.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises that were authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua was awarded the "Hunan Red Tea Root" trademark.
At the Fujian Tea Pavilion, a high mountain tea called "Bing Li Chun" caught the eye of the Fujian tea merchants. They immediately ordered it.
Wang Jiao, Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said that the current epidemic and other factors have some impact on the tea market, but from the scene of the tea exhibition, there are many highlights.
The red tea of Xing'an County is a little red, which has injected the connotation of tea culture. It is popular and trading is hot. The Xiang tea industry welcomes a new spring.
Is it possible to cancel if the food is not hot?
I don't want it. Because there is no parking space below, he failed to deliver it.
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception.
Metaphysics is the basic principle of philosophy, aimed at explaining the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese name "metaphysics" comes from the words of the Book of Changes, "metaphysics is the path, and the material is the instrument". It was translated by Japanese Jiro Tezuka (明治 era).
The philosophical branch includes ontology, natural theology, and its extensions.
The ontology is "the study of what names represent real entities and what names only represent a concept".
The naturalism of metaphysics denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolutionary theory.
The method of naturalism refers to the study of God without saying a word.
Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the essence of consciousness and their relationship with the body (especially the brain).
The two main schools of thought on the relationship between the soul and the body are dualism and monism.
Knowledge theory is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically studies and researches human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the behavior codes recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaphysics of ethics (abstractly studying the essence of ethics or critical ethics) and normative ethics (judging various different ethical views and providing moral guidelines for correct or incorrect behavior).
It studies what kind of ethical behavior standards people should abide by, applied ethics (the academic discipline that applies ethical theories to actual life situations, including bioethics and political ethics), descriptive ethics (the academic discipline that collects information about how people live and makes summaries from observed styles of life).
Its examination of ethics is not from the expected theoretical basis, but from the investigation of the real choices made by actual moral agents (moral agents) and observed by them, which has led to all the ethical factors that have led to this decision, and which has discussed the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Vala and Montaigne.
The second part: the ethics of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
The third part: political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17th-18th century, British experienceism ethics, representative figures: Hume, 17th-18th century, rationalism ethics in Europe, representative figures: Spinoza, 18th century, French enlightenment ethics, representative figures: Voltaire, 18th-19th century, German academy ethics, representative figures: Kant and Hegel, 19th century, British utilitarian ethics, representative figures: Bentham and Sidgwick, 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representative figures: Spencer and Huxley, late 19th century, German new Kantian ethics, representative figures: Lee Kiernan, late 19th century, new Hegelian ethics, representative figures: Thomas Hill Green.
Logic is a discipline that studies "the principles and standards of effective deduction and proof".
Logic usually includes three parts: induction reasoning, cause-effect reasoning and deduction reasoning. It can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
The study of aesthetics focuses on the essence and significance of beauty.

Ting Zili: To my friend.
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all my friends for their humanitarian rescue for more than 30 years after my family members died, especially since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian rescue to friends both at home and abroad in 1994.
Nowadays, most of the old parents of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and married and worked.
It is your act of kindness that helped us to overcome the most difficult times.
At present, the new coronavirus epidemic is sweeping the world, and most of the donors have reached the age of retirement.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to suspend our donations to the mothers of Tiananmen Square, which should have been a perfect ending to this humanitarian aid activity.
I will always remember your love and believe that your act will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I only have to express my wishes in this way, please forgive my friends!
Accept my sincere blessings.
陶业按：I would like to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the history of 32 years of humanitarian relief by the American Institute of Chinese Students (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Fund (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian rescue, the All-US Student Federation and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the implementers of the project often cross.

The relief funds often cannot be successfully delivered to the hands of the victims of the June Fourth.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Ding, a special team was set up by the "Mother of Tiananmen" to coordinate and manage the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, the MCDF set up the "Fund for the Education of Orphaned Children of the June Fourth Incident", which was implemented for 11 years. In 2009, after all the June Fourth orphans graduated from university, the MCDF set up the "Fund for the Special Assistance of Elderly Orphaned People of the June Fourth Incident", which has been implemented ever since.
The funds for these projects come mainly from donations from the campus and the community in the year of the sixth anniversary, from the generous donations of individuals, and are supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Correctional Research Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the families of the Tiananmen victims finally received part of the donations that were collected in Hong Kong under the name of Tiananmen in that year.
During this period, the China Human Rights also independently carried out their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding called off the donation of the June Fourth because he thought about the donors, and we are indeed some retired people. Our income is not as abundant as before. We are grateful to Mr. Ding's letter to his friends.
We will respect the decisions of the bereaved, terminate this project within two years, and immediately resume it when necessary.
We would like to express our gratitude and respect to those comrades who have been generous with their donations and have taken risks to deliver humanitarian aid.

[Service] Service Details: Because I was uncomfortable when I was pregnant, the makeup artist and the staff were very considerate. I rested for a while and they kept me drinking hot water.
Package price: 1000 yuan
Thanks for the review of the rabbit. Originally, I said that the rejection of the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style. I did not expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for your recognition. Your satisfaction can make us full of energy and continue to move forward. We will continue to push!
This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend all my friends to come!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production, it is flawless.
The makeup artist is very delicate. She will match the makeup according to your style. The cosmetics used are also the first brands.
The teacher Tian Liang is not to be mentioned, the photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and there are two small cats to play with.
We work in Beijing. Photographers in Beijing need to queue up for half a year in advance, and my colleagues have photos taken in Beijing. I looked at the finished photos and found that they were just so-so.
I have been searching for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, and we feel that this is also the short version of most people. The photographer Liguang will capture and record the natural wonderful moments.
The makeup artist, the photographer, the post-production designer, a good team.
We and everyone around us were amazed.
She has recommended her friend to go, and her friend has just seen the negative film and is also very happy.
It is hoped that this studio will not be buried, more people will find it, and it will be their own style to shoot, rather than the same style.
We are very grateful for the five-star reviews from Zhan鹰 and Jingling. Both of them are very creative and have a lot of ideas. We are a creative studio. We will do our best to meet the customer's requirements as long as the customer likes. We are grateful for the opportunity to meet each other.
The sweet and considerate assistant, as well as the energetic and cheerful photographer teacher, were all super nice. It was a wonderful time to shoot, an unforgettable experience, and the result was much better than I expected. Thank you all so much!
Thank you, Xiaoyu. It is also a kind of blessing to meet you. From Hohhot to Qingdao, our trust is as many as thousands of kilometers. I am happy to meet you. I will come to Qingdao again next time.
How do I pay?

Now the restaurant staff call me
One who wants to share his personal experience of programming.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't have such ideas, it is better to learn by yourself, because the cost of training is very high and it takes six months to learn.
However, if you are planning to get into this industry, training is indeed a great choice, especially for those with weak self-control. Training is also a great choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can choose to study yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we should look at the strength of the teaching staff of the institution. If the strength of the teaching staff is not strong enough, the training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly opened training institutions have not been very strong.
Secondly, before choosing, it is best to investigate the training institution, and it is better to investigate the students who have graduated from this institution, because only the students of the institution know how the institution is, and whether the courses are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question because I haven't made a certain introduction to your situation. And the study of this thing and the personal situation are very related.
For example, professional, age, language to learn, and even in which city, these will have a relationship with the industry you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or a computer professional who has graduated, then I recommend self-study. This is the lowest efficiency and cost. Now many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but the cost of learning is high, the time investment is more, and it needs to be concentrated training for 3 to 6 months.
However, if these are the cases, self-study is convenient. There are many free learning resources on the web, or you can go to B站 to get many training resources. If you can't find the resources, you can contact me to get free resources or detailed consultation.
There are also some classic books that can be combined with video to learn.
If you are not a computer professional, but you can pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then you should go to the training institution to learn, so that the learning is not very difficult, the teacher explains it very detailed, and there is also help in the learning planning or supervision.
In addition, many training institutions will sign employment agreements, and there are internship positions, so that later job interviews can save a lot of things.
All of the above is my opinion. Because I don't know your situation, I only give a general introduction and not detailed information. If you have other questions to consult, you can contact me at any time.
I said 1 o'clock, I saw it on the app

Thank you for those who have been silent and liked me. I work hard for my life. Life is hard, but I have to continue.
Life will not disappoint every person who works hard. If you like it, follow me. Thank those who are silent and give me likes.
Life is like this. People only look at the result. You alone support the process. Facing life, we must not only be strong, but continue. There is no other choice but to look back and walk forward...
Cleaning is a job, but also a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of services, and services are wonderful because of care.

Success comes from hard work and dedication. We are serious about our work.
Give me the opportunity, I will make you satisfied. Quality is everything, because professionalism deserves to be trusted. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
At present, all industries are not doing well!
But I always believe that I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining!"
The key to success is in the morning. All good things start in the morning. I wish you happiness, luck, health, and prosperity on your journey. Good morning!
When I was young, happiness was something that you owned when you were happy. When I grew up, happiness was a goal that you reached when you were happy. When I matured, I found that happiness was actually a kind of attitude, and understanding was happiness.
Do the most authentic and kindest self, follow the heart, and be without regret in this life; there is only one way in life, follow your own path; there are two treasures in life: a good body and a good mood, and live happily all your life!
Every stage of life will encounter different problems.
In many cases, the thing that binds you is not ability, but the courage to face.
Since we can't avoid it, let's face it.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down; the more you face the difficulties, the more you will solve the problems.
The exhibition curators of China and Saudi Arabia jointly held the first contemporary art exhibition in Saudi Arabia - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haidong,胡冠) The inaugural Contemporary Art Biennale of Saudi Arabia - Diliye Contemporary Art Biennale was officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diliye JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participating.
The biennale was co-organized by the Saudi Diyer Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Yuelu Contemporary Art Center in China. The director of the UCCA Yuelu Contemporary Art Center, Tian Fuyi, was the artistic director of the biennale.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the biennale is "crossing the river with stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the economic and social transformation period, and reflects the current situation of Saudi society and culture development.
The biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and is displayed in six buildings that are interconnected. It is presented in six units, including "Going Over the River with the Stone", "Continuity as an Experiment", "Peripheral Thinking", "Going Public", a "New Beautiful World", and "Aspects of the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including painting, installation art and performance art; the works of 12 Chinese artists are also very popular, and some artists use innovative ways to use recycled materials to create works, such as Xu Bing in the "Story Series of Behind the Story" (2014), using discarded materials to reconstruct a classic landscape painting.
Barclay, chief executive officer of the Diliye Foundation, said that he hoped that the current Diliye Biennale would establish international dialogue and allow global audiences to have the opportunity to understand the vibrant cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen exchanges and interactions.
Tian Fuyou said: "The goal of the biennale is double, so that Saudi contemporary art can participate in the global dialogue and Saudi audiences can integrate into the contemporary art world. "
It is reported that during the opening week of the biennale, a series of lectures will be held, and artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare positions - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Binfeng) In order to continue to do a good job in supporting the employment of poverty-stricken people and consolidating and expanding the achievements of poverty eradication, the Yunnan Provincial People's Government recently issued relevant policies to promote the revitalization of rural China, which will help to fully promote the revitalization of rural China.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Human Resources and Social Security Bureau of Yunnan Province, at present, 44.83 million rural public welfare positions have been developed in Yunnan, which are used for the employment of poverty-stricken labor forces and other rural difficult groups, and have played an important role in helping the poor to increase income, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of rural public services.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization and Finance, and it mainly unified the scope of recruitment of personnel for public welfare positions at the grass-roots level, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions.
In terms of the establishment of job positions, the new regulations clearly stipulate that job positions should be set up according to the principles of "setting up job positions according to the needs of the job, setting people according to the job, dynamic management, total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person, one job, voluntary public, unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, examination, publicity, appointment, on-the-job training and arrangement of on-the-job training.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main departments of the development of rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare positions, and stipulate that the development departments of rural public welfare positions should purchase accident insurance for the personnel of rural public welfare positions; require the relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution of rural public welfare positions.

Hello
Can you cancel the order?
I re-ordered
Is it cancelled?
II. Although the right-wing has a prosperous era in history, it is not long, so it is short because it is shining when it is given a little sunshine and it is sweating when it is given a little hot water; it is getting more and more ambitious as it gets more and more successful.
But in fact, the right-wing played a positive role in the process of social progress.
It is not right to deny the positive significance of the right wing in ending the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, raising the level of science and technology and promoting the institutionalization of political systems and human rights protection.
For me, although I do not agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am concerned about his statements and respect him as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also serious about China's social problems.
But I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I believe that the necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social instability,民生 damage, political groups of mud and sand, and then foreign countries will take advantage of it.
Fourthly, it is necessary to have patience and attitude of responsibility to the country and the people when changing or improving China. Those who try to take advantage of others in politics are not rightists, but scoundrels.
Let's talk about left.
Left, in fact, a bunch of time and political orphans.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed, but the left has no chance because the left wants what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Five. Recently, some friends have been arguing against the rebels while refuting the leftists, which is quite energetic. I think it is unnecessary.
Do not try to reason with the traitor and the leftist. They are all one-sided and have no reason to talk.
Do not try to prove that we are right, and do not try to make the enemy and the left crazy admit, why?
I tell my friends like this: When the counterfeiter calls you five cents, when the left madman calls you right dog, it just proves that our middle way is right!
Many people have ideals in their youth, but when they grow old, they forget their ideals or pursue their ideals, but they become obsessed.
And the ideal is gradually fading away, and even the dragon boy becomes a dragon.
On the left and right, I think it generally refers to restraint and freedom. From the historical and cultural先天 genes of China, China as a whole should be to the left.
The domestic right wing is focused on efficiency and development, while the left wing is focused on fairness and safety.
At present, the general trend of society is to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, China and the United States are competing, and the left is certain. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, I just like to like it.
Nothing to say, flowers are just like this
In the past two years, the blockade and blockade of the United States on Huawei's chips have not only caused Huawei unprecedented difficulties, but also caused huge losses for "US-based" enterprises.
The United States has suppressed the chip industry in China, requiring its own enterprises and allies to block the chip industry in China at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in a decrease in the research and development investment of chip production enterprises, a decrease in production capacity, and thus a shortage of the global chip supply chain.
Now, the "芯" shortage has spread to all major industries around the world, such as the suspension of car production and the price increase of mobile phones. Almost all industries that use chips are affected.
In order to gain control over the "chip", more and more countries' technology giants are beginning to take the road of "denationalization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights and restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has been making frequent moves recently, hosting the "IC Summit" and inviting 64 major companies to set up a semiconductor alliance, and allocating funds to support the development of US domestic technology giants, such as, the US old technology giant Intel has invested 20 billion US dollars to build two semiconductor processing factories in Arizona and open the chip manufacturing business to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on Taiwan Semiconductor, and it was likely to steal Taiwan Semiconductor's "job".
This is because Intel, as a veteran US technology giant, has been working in the semiconductor industry for more than 40 years, and has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves. It is certain to rise rapidly and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, for the decision of Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Founder TSMC Zhang Zhongming was indifferent.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Chang Chien-ming said that he had no qualms about saying that Intel's investment in building a wafer plant was quite ironic.
The reason why Chang Zhongmou was displeased with Intel's entry into the semiconductor industry is that Chang Zhongmou still felt bitter about the feud between Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the jewel in the US manufacturing industry, and it was at the top of the world. It was the world leader in the semiconductor industry.
In the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chips were always in the hands of a few strong people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. The chip was designed, manufactured and tested by one factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model makes some small businesses too heavy, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only look away from the huge production line construction costs.
In response to the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to show the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Chang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, then it was possible to set up a special factory for the manufacture of chips.
Shortly after that, TSMC was born.
The main business of Taiwan Semiconductor is aimed at the single link of "wafer processing". It does not design, but only provides the service of wafer manufacturing.
At that time, TSMC, which was just founded, was a subordinate of Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Chang Zhongmou had sought investment from Intel, but at that time, when Intel heard that Taiwan Semiconductor only did the manufacturing sector of the chip industry, it was obviously arrogant and despised Taiwan Semiconductor. It refused to invest in Taiwan Semiconductor.
Zhang Zhongmou also believes that Intel was arrogant at the time.
It was not expected that the giants who despised the semiconductor manufacturing services would have to start doing the semiconductor manufacturing themselves.
Therefore, it is ironic that Intel entered the wafer manufacturing industry.
Today, the market value of Taiwan Semiconductor has exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of the strong attack of Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel is naturally not afraid of stagnation.
Now, Taiwan Semiconductor has pushed towards the 3nm chip, while Intel is still stuck at 7 years ago 14nm.
It is not easy to catch up.
No waiting.

Today, let's watch some strange hot searches.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot topics were picked at random: the dragon抬头 in February, the price increase of Good Luck Friends, and the Cargo拉拉 event. The public opinion spread and formed a peak, and then the "Index Down" (smooth curve) finally dissipated. If there was secondary public opinion, there would be a small hump again.
They look the same as the "Internet public opinion evolution model" shown on the official website of the Internet Information Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot topics from the same event were picked at random, displaying the characteristics of “peaks”, “teeth” and “cliffs”.
The "peaks and valleys" refers to the artificial heating and rapid rise to the hot search list, which attracts the public attention. The "scissors" refers to the periodic heating to ensure that the topic stays on the hot search list. The "valley" refers to the collective evacuation, which makes the hot search finish its "function" and receives a new task and rushes to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat wave of an event coincides exactly with the trough of another event, and the time difference is not a second, which must be the same batch of water forces receiving the task and launching a new round of attacks.
It can be seen from the specialization of black public relations: dozens of hot search terms are listed at the same time. Which attracts attention, which is responsible for popular science, which leads to war, which creates propaganda, which转移 attention, which affects cognition, which misleads judgment, which煽动 emotion, which is entangled in decision-making, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes, and almost all the elements in the spread of public opinion are considered.
Communication is a science. Apart from the subjective factors of position and emotion, only the objective data, the black PR will also disappear.
Everywhere you go, you will leave traces. These traces, we will dig them out together.

Mauritius and other countries have found the first case of infection of the O. tsutsugamushi strain - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12. According to the report of foreign correspondents of Xinhua News Agency, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of infection with the new variant of the coronavirus.
On the 10th day of the month, Mauritius reported its first two cases of infection with the Omicron virus.
According to Kailesh Jagutpal, the Minister of Public Health, one of the infected people was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27; the other one was a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive after contact with someone who recently visited South Africa.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the two infected people had their nucleic acid tests turned negative. They have now returned to their respective residences.
Cyprus Health Ministry announced on the 10th that the country had confirmed its first three cases of infection with the Omicron virus.
These three people are students. They came back from abroad last month. Since they were mild cases, they did not go to the hospital.
In order to prevent the spread of the virus, the government has continuously increased the prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers aged 12 and above who arrive by plane will have to pay for the核酸 test at the airport.
On the 10th, the Ministry of Health also announced that it would start to vaccinate children aged 5 to 11 in the country with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
On the 9th, the Malawian Minister of Health, Dr. Francis Kimbila, said that the country had found its first three cases of infection with the O. tsutsugamushi strain.
The country's health department sequenced the genomes of 12 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found the three cases of infection.

360° integrated home decoration
Address: 156 Ring Road, Happy Home 12
At first, it was introduced by friends because of trust. So I chose to come and have a look at my budget was 70,000 yuan for a basic renovation.
When he came to the store, he began a series of tricks.
I have never been to the store before. I just showed my floor plan to them. They didn't measure the house on the ground. They quoted me a price of RMB7 million for my 135 square meters house. They showed me their materials, but I didn't know what kind of materials they were.
Their second trick is that if you just go to the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and once you pay the deposit, you will never get it back, unless you have enough experience to fight them in court).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that you could get a certain amount of discount if you paid the deposit today.
This is a big pit, and I am an example of being deceived. When I was impulsive, I paid more than 10,000 yuan in deposits.
He gave me a lot of questions about the price, including the renovation of water and electricity, including any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, and these three are the main costs of the basic package.
In addition, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies.
I lost trust in this company, and I signed the contract without any explanation at all.
When I went to get my money back, they showed a lot of experience. There were special small teams to deal with you.
In any case, it is the customer's problem, and they have no responsibility.
There are various excuses and many details that I don't want to say one by one. In short, don't choose them, because my friend's house was also of poor quality when he hired them to do the renovation.
Shame on them, they are the original fake龙头 decoration, and now they have changed to be beautiful, but they seem to have failed again and again.
Therefore, people should not choose such a pitiful construction company.
In the future, when people choose, they should look up these and consult because the decoration is not small money.
If you want to ask the merchant a question, please log in or register first.
It is strictly forbidden to publish various forms of merchant reviews, please see the merchant collection statement

So terrifying, please cancel the order within 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
OK, then don't cancel this conversation. If I don't get my money back within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely take action.
I asked whether it could be cancelled within 15 minutes.

The Great Tide of the Gemini Meteor Shower on the 14th - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (reporter Zhou Runjian) -- As the last major meteor shower of the year, the Gemini Meteor Shower, which is one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. People who like meteor showers can watch it after midnight on December 14.
On December 13, 2018, Beijing astronomer An Jiu took pictures of the Gemini meteor shower in Qinghai Province.
Most meteor showers are associated with periodic comets, but the mother body of the Gemini meteor shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not produced by a comet.
Shu Lipeng, a member of the Astronomical Society of China in Tianjin and an expert in astronomical popularization, said that just like the New Year's blockbuster, the Gemini流星雨 usually occurs at the end of the year, and "the release schedule" can last from December 4 to December 17.
This meteor shower is known for its large and steady stream. It is one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere with the Pleiades meteor shower and the Orion meteor shower.
One of the notable characteristics of the Gemini流星雨 is that the meteorite speed is slow, the color is rich, and there are a lot of fire meteors. It is suitable for both sightseeing and amateur astronomical photography.
On December 13, 2020, Yang Jing, an amateur astronomer in Tianjin, took a photograph of the Gemini meteor shower in Beizhou, Tianjin.
According to astronomical forecasts, the twin star meteor shower this year will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th. At this time, the ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observation conditions) is 150.
The recommended index of the Gemini meteor shower.
Last year, the Gemini meteor shower of "Flower Fall" left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be interfered by the moon, and the beauty will be slightly reduced.
On the 14th, it was the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar. The bright moonlight would interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon would fall later in the night. At this time, the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower would also rise higher.
Fans of shooting stars can watch them in the next few hours after the moon sets, but they should keep warm and warm. "
How can we observe more meteors?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a location with a high altitude, small light pollution, and a wide view to the northeast. Then you can wait patiently for the moon to fall and observe by sight.
It is necessary to note that the流量 of the Gemini meteor shower is very large in all directions. It is not necessary to keep looking at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
If you are a lover of photography, you should choose a wide angle and a large aperture lens to shoot a beautiful "rainbow picture". Use a high ISO and the maximum aperture.
Based on stability and continuity, a tripod, a backup battery and a shutter line are also necessary. "
He reminded that.
What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV that the subject said should refer to the LCD TV. The differences between the market positioning of the laser TV and the LCD TV are mainly as follows:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of the widespread LCD TV, the laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or the laser TV itself is a product born for the large screen.
At present, the mainstream LCD TV sizes are generally 55 inches to 65 inches, while the laser TV sizes are generally more than 75 inches, and the largest are more than 100 inches, which fully meet the user's demand for large screen TVs.
In recent years, the global sales volume and sales share of laser TV have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total sales of 80-inch and above TVs.
According to the prediction of Zhongyi Kang, the market sales of laser TV will increase by more than 140% in 2020, continuing to maintain high growth.
The good performance in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in terms of eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eye. Compared with the backlight source of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the natural condition of the object's imaging process, and the stimulation to the eyes is smaller.
Through a strict comparison experiment of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions in the population, the laboratory of the China Institute of Electronics Technology Standardization and Beijing Hospital of Ophthalmology obtained 144 sets of test data.
The data confirm that the laser TV has strong eye protection characteristics and even has certain improvement effects in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is becoming more and more important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opens up another breakthrough in the TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the downward trend of LCD TV prices, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are generally more than 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price is gradually rising.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It is certain that it is reasonable.
With the continuous development of light sources and technical levels, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be realized by LCD TV and projection.
With the help of the ultra short throw projector technology, the laser TV's projection distance is relatively shorter than that of the traditional projection equipment. It can realize a 100-inch screen experience at a short distance, and the required space is small, and the main body is small and occupies a small space.
In terms of brightness, the big brand laser TV can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generated is lower, and the life of the equipment is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models also carry many cutting-edge technologies such as real 4K ultra-high definition quality, artificial intelligence system, and bio-inspired screen, which can provide users with more shocking audiovisual experience.
It is not a fake demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, the laser TV is not the dish of audio and video players. If you want to balance the big screen and the viewing environment, you can try. Everything has its pros and cons. After weighing the pros and cons, you can make your own judgment.
In short, the ultra-wide angle close-up projector - laser TV has to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and mirrors to get close to the screen, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to block part of the environmental light, use the micro-structure of the Fresnel screen, which is expensive, and the price of 80 inches is basically equivalent to a 65-inch LCD.
And one more thing, I really dislike when the projection manufacturers put the漫反射 for good for the eyes as the selling point. Please, the light on the screen for the eyes is the direct light, you reflect to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it. If you insist on comparing the LCD TV with the direct light, don't you think the ceiling will also be illuminated when you turn on the TV?
And if the projector screen is not a diffuse reflection, it will not be able to make a picture.
It was just ignored that the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen was, that a lot of light was reflected to the eyes in a certain angle, which was really painful.
The Visual Beauty Photography Gallery is the best quality store. It has not yet opened a branch
When I added the WeChat appointment date, the sister arranged the time for me. The reply was timely.
Before going, I had looked at the store's shooting works, more were outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful and involved many shooting styles.
When I arrived that day, I talked to the sister about my ideas, and she was very patient and helped me try two styles of clothes that I was confused about. Finally, we decided to start makeup and hair styling. The photographer would set up some props before shooting, and he would also give some instructions on the action and the details.
However, it may be because I did not talk about the specific shooting ideas with you, so the style of the shooting is not what I want, but it should be beautiful.
After the photo is taken, the photographer will help choose the photos, communicate the post-processing style, and feel quite careful.
It takes about half a month to repair the film and wait for the effect.
Second time to win the buffet of a photo shoot. Most of the clothes can be chosen to be photographed.
Finally, I chose a black gown to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process took about 2 hours. The makeup + shooting. The photographer in charge of the shooting was the brother of the 95th generation. I felt a little shy. I hope that I can give more suggestions for the customer's shooting action guidance in the future. He is very talkative. The shooting process is more pleasant.
The Visual Art Photography Gallery is the best quality store.
It has been featured on the home page, so check it out!
When I came to the store, I first filled in my name and phone number, and then chose the clothing. I can also choose the wedding dress. I was very patient when I changed three or four sets of clothing. The service attitude was good. After the shooting, they will teach you how to pose. My face was very big when I took the picture. The fine art said that it would take half a month. It came in three or four days. It seems that it is not different from the original picture.
The environment is good overall.
There are many optional clothes.
There are three makeup positions in the studio.
The service is very warm and attentive.
The stylist was patient.
The photographer will also be very serious about teaching you the action.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also propose to take pictures again.
(Experience) Maybe the shape is a little too much. The original double eyelid was put on three eyelids.
The eyebrows were also trimmed, which was a little embarrassing because I did not draw the eyebrows on a daily basis.
The picture has been given for a few days, but the P picture effect is not satisfied. I feel that the eyebrows are still obvious.
Because it is not clear what style to choose, I have tried two styles. Finally, I chose the black dress. The little sister said that this style is more like the style of Grace Kelly.
After selecting the clothes, I began to do my makeup and hair. The hairdresser and makeup artist were very patient and helped me a lot. The effect was very satisfactory.
After getting ready, I started to take pictures. The photographer had me pose all the way. It was easy and harmonious.
After shooting, I carefully chose four favorite photos as the best. The little brother said that it would be finished within 15 days. I was very satisfied with the ending.
It has been 3 days without a reply... because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card to pay
I have to pay for each shipment now
Can I be exempted from paying my monthly fee until you have investigated me?
Is it safe to buy a small umbrella insurance?
Little umbrella is an Internet insurance broker platform.
From the perspective of the conditions for setting up: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokers (Revised in 2015)," becoming an insurance broker must meet three key words: shareholders, founders must have no major violations in the last three years, the minimum amount is 50 million yuan, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are actually very strict. In summary, it is necessary to have strength, to have the approval of the National Authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (the regulatory body for insurance companies and banks in China), and to have a good style of shareholders. As a small umbrella insurance company, Xiaoyu insurance, the insurer does not need to question whether Xiaoyu insurance is legitimate or not, because there are these three thresholds. Not every insurance company can achieve this.
At this point, it is good and trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is a insurance supermarket, and many companies' star critical illness insurance is sold on this platform, such as the latest listing and Tai Super Mario 5 critical illness insurance, the insurer and the insurer are and Tai Life, and the third-party broker is not in doubt about its credibility.
From the point of view of payment mode: Internet platform products are generally more affordable because they do not include the cost of operating outlets and the cost of salaries of businessmen, and the payment mode is flexible, supporting monthly payment, alleviating the payment pressure of the insurer, and at the same time, the insurance leverage can be maximized.
This is very good.
It can be considered.
From the point of view of the professionalism of salesmen: this is particularly important, because insurance is a highly professional industry. Many Internet products can be insured by customers themselves. This will lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health declarations and occupations, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective consciousness when they insure, believing that they are healthy or suitable, which is easy to pose a risk of denial of claims.
I have worked as an insurance salesman for "QQ Health Insurance" (which is similar to Xiaoyu伞, an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is real, reliable, and unreliable. Unreliable are people, and the Internet channel does not have professional personnel. There are also many sales misunderstandings.
For example, 1 yuan insurance can protect 600,000 yuan, buy insurance and give a mobile phone, free 6 million yuan of critical illness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are lightweight, will not tell the insurer that the first month is 1 yuan, the second month is normal, and the amount is different from 20 to 200, many customers have not paid for a few years, and they don't know what they have bought.
I thought I could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company would pay 60 million yuan (the world is falling down).
The free mobile phone is only for the special number segment such as 66666, 88888, and if the winning message is sent, the person will not exchange it and no one will remind.
(This is another pit for the insurer, and another one for the insured person) Getting a free insurance amount of RMB 60,000 is a short-term benefit, but if you only rely on this, you will not have other commercial insurance, and if you really have a serious illness, what will you do with the RMB 60,000, which cannot solve the problem, and you will have to live your life naked.
At present, the country is also cracking down on the misleading sales of Internet insurance.
Therefore, in general, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, and the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the businessmen.
It is suggested that the subject consider the overall situation carefully. In fact, the products of many offline insurance brokers are more extensive, and the opportunities and products for customers to choose are more. Some products have a better price than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet clients, insured offline products, and saved 2000-3000 yuan/year for each person.
If you have any questions, please contact me.
Me: Mingya insurance broker, with 3 years of enterprise management training experience, more than 1,000 enterprise user services, more than 100 insurance companies, before insurance, I will start from the needs of the client, customize the insurance products for the client, during the insurance, I will compare the results of the three insurance companies for the client, strive to get the best results for the client, and after insurance, I will do the job of the client, the job of the client, and make the client worry-free.
Grow with every customer.
I hope my answer can help you!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance procedures independently after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the insurer.
Although Internet insurance is not very "ritualistic", even if there is no printed version of the contract, it does not affect the validity and legal effectiveness of the electronic version of the contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the "telephone sales" general assembly line operation, but such insurance purchase will also have a fatal problem, that is, - the follow-up service may not be able to keep up with the pace.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract of several decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "mediator" we choose is a "long-term companion" that can provide services for us many years later?

Thank you for your help.
From before to now, I have always opposed any form of smear and abuse, and I cannot accept such behavior.
In a civilized society, we can accommodate everything, but we must eliminate this villain.
If you don't look at parties and factions, the first to be opposed is this uncivilized style.
From the moment when you began to ask me on Facebook to be your friend, and then posted satirical posts, to the moment when you tried to post the address of my house and my father's name on social media, I have taken the attitude of not responding.
Not only did you continue to tag me according to the frequency of six meals a day, but you also continued to discuss about me some hidden and humiliating words with your so-called friends on Facebook, and left some obscene comments about my looks, figure, good breeding, and whether I planted strawberries on bed or not, etc. I...
I didn't know that later, I received a lot of friends who sent me a lot of information about your Facebook friends.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't continue to be silent.
After uploading the news that I called the police, you have not calmed down, but you have become more and more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, or what your status is, in our society, it is necessary for men and women to be respected.
Yes, you can continue this kind of humorous, subtle, humiliating, and insulting remarks, or you can continue to say that you only care about and concern me, or you can continue to think that this is not harassment, or you can continue to deny that it is not your work, or you can continue to deny that it is not you, or you can continue to deny everything.
Yes, I can't and I can't stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you, and my appearance and figure do not need your comments.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to humiliate herself in this way to gain fame.
My friend asked me how I was doing.
I said yes, but you wouldn't believe me.
I don't think there is any girl who can say she is okay after being bullied like this.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic ethics will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of the people.
I cut some comments for you to judge
No one can impersonate you, right?
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization

The main stream of the Yangtze River has achieved full coverage of the water green comprehensive service area - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Qian) The Chongqing Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service area in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the launch of the Chongqing Water Green Comprehensive Service Area on the 8th.
By now, the water green comprehensive service area has covered the Yangtze River upstream, middle and downstream.
Cui Jianhua, deputy director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration, said that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built and operated 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the vast majority of crew members and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the water green comprehensive service area is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping. The ability of the Yangtze River to receive and carry out shipping services has been significantly enhanced.
According to reports, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services for a large number of ships and crew members to help solve the problems of "urgent and difficult".
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which were completed and put into operation this time, integrate life service, production service and government service into one, with the theme of green and environmental protection and the specialty of ship repair and emergency rescue service, so as to realize the "one-time docking and multiple services" of ships in the port and make the crew working on the Yangtze River more efficient and convenient.
US Three Aircraft Carriers Converge on China’s Periphery, and the Most Powerful Weapon is Rare to Visit Guam in 2022-01-17, multidimensional The most pro-Central Chinese media, multidimensional reports: latest satellite images show that the US three aircraft carriers are converging on the periphery of China; the US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the arsenal of the US Navy is rare to visit Guam, and it releases important signals to the allies and adversaries of the US in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" of China's think tank, on January 9, the satellite found the U.S. Navy "Carl Vinson" (USS Carl Vinson) aircraft carrier near the Strait of Bali.
The Barabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the West Pacific.
The platform expects that the "Carl Vinson" will deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first time for the “Carl Vinson” to deploy the F-35C fighter and the CMV-22 “魚鷹” helicopter.
The US Navy warship that is currently sailing in the Pacific Ocean is not only the "Carl Vinson", but also the "Abraham Lincoln", which left the United States on January 3.
The “Lincoln” also carried the F-35C fighter squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th fighter attack squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, including the aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan, which is docked in Sasebo, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the “Shandong Lake” missile cruiser and the “Stokdal” missile destroyer.
The United States has deployed three of its warships in the vicinity of China. The most powerful weapons have rarely visited Guam. On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that the United States had deployed three of its warships in the vicinity of China,
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) The three US warships gathered in the vicinity of China. The most powerful weapon rarely visited Guam on January 17, 2022.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) According to the report of CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the arsenal of the US Navy visited the island of Guam for the first time in a long time.
The nuclear submarine "Nevada", carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The three American warships gathered around China's periphery, and the most powerful weapons rarely visited Guam. Analysts said this was a signal to allies and enemies in the Indian-Pacific region, which is becoming increasingly tense.
This is the first time for the US ballistic missile submarine to visit Guam since 2016 and the second time since the 1980s.
The three American warships gathered in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapons rarely visited Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea in recent years.
The picture shows the Yongxue Island in the South China Sea.
(South China Sea Research Forum) In the statement, the US Navy said that the visit of the Ohio class nuclear submarine "Nevada" to Guam strengthened the cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, showed the capabilities, flexibility and readiness of the United States and its commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
The ballistic missile submarine is usually called the "boomer submarine".
The movements of 14 "Raygun" submarines in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secret of the ballistic missile submarine has made the "raysubmarine" the most important survival weapon in the three-in-one nuclear system, which includes the ballistic missile launched from the base on the mainland of the United States, as well as the B- 2 and B- 52 bombers with nuclear warheads.
When talking to friends about the recent drop of 26 percent in Meta, the loss of 2510 billion US dollars in market capitalization, Zuckerberg responded that "we are facing unprecedented competition". Why is this the case?
Meta (originally Facebook) is actually a advertising company. Its income is mainly from advertising. Today, a profitable advertising company must have its own channels of traffic.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of function positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
In addition, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", and many apps are connected to Meta through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta is difficult to get user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is friendly to users, and will clearly indicate whether users allow the app to obtain their information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google continues to stab, the income impact will be greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in the income growth of Meta has weakened (the proportion of which is uncertain, but it exists).
Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual income comes from China, mainly from companies that make sea business in China.
Meta's office in Hong Kong has about a hundred people, and there are several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is an unavoidable advertising channel. The money they burn is mostly given to Meta.
Interestingly, at present, Byte's TT is one of the main competitors of Meta, but in the past two years, Meta has made a lot of money from Byte.
All the agents in China are helping ByteDance to advertise on Meta. Meta's performance in China is also good.
Recently, I have not specifically investigated, but it will definitely not be better than before.
The stage of massive burning of money by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Third, the new flow channel expansion is not successful.
Facebook is getting older and older, and new platforms such as TT are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only concerned with income, but also with the future expectations.
It is obvious that Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "original universe".
The original universe is indeed one of the directions of the future, but the realization cycle of the original universe is relatively long. This story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the past two or three years.
Therefore, in the next two years, Meta should be more difficult.
Although Facebook is currently very prosperous, with annual revenues of US $100 billion to US $200 billion, it is actually very vulnerable. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good and safe defensive wall.
Although his several social software have high daily active users and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has little confidence in the rapid development of TikTok, and it is just a blink of an eye.
The concept of the origin of the universe is very difficult to achieve, and there is no hope of success in a short period of time. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous, and this is the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg is constantly looking for new tracks. However, I think his track selection is wrong, and it is a one-way road.
