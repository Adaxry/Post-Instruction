The goods cost under 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods...
I am #PRS_ORG# Grandmaster and therefore it is not a problem for me.
You only need a number or an instruction as to where I should put the package so that it can be returned to you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today, it costs 179 euros.
I find that very disturbing.
Should I cancel my order and re-order for the better price or is there another way to get a signature?
I also fundamentally believe that children should not be expected to take on parental roles.
However, I find that it is also good to measure up to the small ones in measures.
Look, help, bring the bottle etc.
They learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as she can still be a child herself, I don't see any problem.
If your child is occupied for a short time and it is okay for him, that's good.
You can best assess whether this is suitable for your children.
It is not so that he is going to wiggle his way to the top and spend hours sleeping.
It is likely to be questionable legally.
Perhaps the psychologist's statement is also true.
Because if something did actually happen, such as a fire, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to worry about, and too much responsibility for K2 to worry about.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is up to you;)
Could you please help me find the title of a book?
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost all of the action, but I don't want to call it that anymore perhaps someone knows...
History deals with fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of history, a farmer commits suicide by pouring fertilizer on himself and running to his pig.
The case is being taken over by a commissioner, who will investigate his therapists for a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The commissioner has a small nanny who is also afraid (of fire) and lands on this therapist.
There are more suicides, and another protagonist appears - a photographer who is hired to go to the site of each suicide and document it, and post the photos online.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist is actually running a form of underground therapy where patients are implanted with chips that suppress the part of the brain responsible for fear, and the patients are ultimately put in the extreme position of having to put their fears to the test.
(A woman jumps out of the window and another is driven to death with intent)
This is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic with a fire.
That is the great deed I am certain that the book was originally written in French by a French author/author.
If this action is known to someone, or even if someone can convince me of the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh yes, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I must first contact my husband.
But it can take a long time.
What steps must I take?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Kind, 4 j., Splitter under the Daumennagel
Kind, four years old, has been sleeping through the entire length of the wooden fence (exterior).
They tried to pin him with a pin.
Very difficult to grasp.
Didn't crack and did well.
Now the child is hysterical when we try.
No more chances.
It goes to the doctor tomorrow.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining a digital decoder and sound module on a single board, we are able to achieve measurements of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can therefore be inserted into almost any loop of the spine H0 and 0.
The LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all the usual sample rates and always come with a 11x15mm thick "sucker cube" loudspeaker and a soundboard.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multiprotocol decoder.
He controls the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are as self-explanatory as two- and four-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically connect to a suitable digital central station.
He dominates all DCC programmers and thanks to RailCom® it is possible to read the CV values on the main rail with the appropriate central.
For central, which can only program the CVs of 1-255, there is a help register.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speeds at 255 addresses.
Three other Motorola addresses allow the resolution of 16 functions.
An embedded programming model also makes it possible to reprogram the reliable control unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration at mfx compatible central offices.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognises Märklin® brake lines as well as ZIMO® HLU brake signals or the Lenz® ABC system.
Even the brakes with DCC brake lines or with equalization are possible.
In addition, he also holds a seat on the board of directors of Selectrix®.
An ABC automatic escalator allows the automatic movement between two platforms.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used for analog broadcasts.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to call for impeachment
New cases of Omikron concern politics and science in Great Britain.
As a result, all eligible adults in England will be offered a vaccine by the new year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to take advantage of the rapidly increasing numbers of people getting tested for the coronavirus more quickly than before.
Every adult in England should already have received their first dose of the vaccine by the end of the year, unless they have been away from home for at least three months since their second dose, Johnson said in a video message to his constituents on Sunday evening.
Until now, the deadline has been at the end of January.
The British government will also provide support to speed up the vaccination campaign in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the Omicron variant, one is standing in a situation of emergency, which requires urgent action on the part of the authorities, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased with a third dose.
Let us now boostern!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omicron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65%. dpa
Is the full amount refunded at the time of cancellation?
I am for everyone to use pronouns
I have sent an application.
Today, the invitation came via email.
I want to respond to the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but something more complicated.
I have bullied him and whenever he has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write an email now.
Can someone help me?
** I am an alien and do not want to have any officials running over me.
Conclusion: Everyone should use pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books.
Four of them go.
That is not what I have bought today
It is obvious that the chair has a non-visible shortage in stock.
How can such a police damage after 9 months?
Only on #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working for about
No more for 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I have 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like to add them to your order and place them in your bill.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help it.
Content warning: I will write something about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about the soul.
I (21) often come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One of the themes that really nags at me and often comes up is that many victims cannot be helped or we cannot help them.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my field that move me more than when I can do nothing.
I see the blue dots, the blood, the lost eyes...
But even in conversation, with the perpetrator well out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of blame, fear of abandoning the known social environment, fear of entering the children from this.
What I always wanted to make clear to everyone is that I myself am very close to the tears, but that everyone can live without violence.
I want all women to know they don't have to resort to violence.
I often wish I could help... I know I can't.
But it will never be lighter.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so important.
Arcane on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends"?
Much fantasy, many complicated names, a mind-blowing revealing: Arcane, the series from the League of Legends computer game universe, has recently been released on Netflix.
Why do we enjoy the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on young Johannes Patrick.
Nothing at all: For the second time in three months, the giants in Crailsheim lost - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with reference to the cup defeat at the beginning of October against Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
After the game, however, she did not sit down - she stood up again due to the 61 - 72 (28 - 38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereas more than the naked result the way of the performance showed.
The representative is a statistic that summarizes the entire dilemma: The three-quarters quote currently amounts to 13 percent, four attempts (all of them by young Johannes Patrick) on spelling and grammar, and 31 attempts - are there still any questions?
John Patrick's answer was, "We were not focused enough after the victory at Teneriffa, and we did not implement what we had trained".
That is, to move the ball.
All of a sudden, Sebastian Gleim came into play: "A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like before 10,000 people."
Only 750 visitors were allowed into the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they had to pay for it.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team to victory.
The best player I have ever trained, praised Gleim.
While Patrick's teammates Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed all over the field.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came back to eight points, after they had already lost 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon came in twelfth place.
Unfortunately, there is no time to waste.
Already on Wednesday (19.00), the giants received the skyliners Frankfurt, before then in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.
We had another email address before, but I changed it.
Yes, I have reported it a few months ago.
All performance claims have been rejected.
We have once again informed ourselves of the law and have once again complied with it.
We had already reported this half a year ago.
Always like from the sea: Max Raabe will be 59
He wants to seduce his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on tour with the program "Good morning, happy luck" - if he wants to perform at all.
Max Raabe actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig on Sunday.
But there is nothing there.
The planned concert was postponed to May 2022 - "on the instructions of the authorities" in order to prevent the Corona virus.
Even other engagements he had in mind for the Advent season have to fall by the wayside, as is stated on the singer's website, which is now at number 59, and his musicians' (www.palast-orchester.de) website.
From January, the artists then want to reclaim their 2020 terms, which were postponed due to the pandemic.
Max Raabe was born on December 12, 1962 in the north Rhine-Westphalia town of Lünen. As a teenager, he had sung quite a lot.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra together with the Kommilitonen.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the comedian harmonists.
He has been awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For Women Is This No Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has made it mainstream.
Max Raabe is no longer to be wondered about from the current German-speaking music scene.
He has been on tour with the program "Good morning, happy luck" since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister of the Interior Klara Geywitz: There is no new apartment through eviction
The new Federal Minister of the Interior, Clara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the eviction of large apartment complexes, as has been demanded in Berlin in a popular vote.
Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday) that with a change of ownership there would not be a single new apartment, but only a change in the residents' structure.
My goal is to provide tenants with security that their rent will be paid in the coming years.
In addition, a mix of private landlords, tenants and housing associations is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left parties wants to set up an expert commission, as is indicated by the result of the people's vote.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz is not going to talk to the FDP about further tightening in the real estate market.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent cap until 2029, limits rent increases in tight rental markets, and expands the rental pool.
I will talk to the justice minister to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not improve, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 killed by tornado in Kentucky
Many tornadoes have occurred in the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 people could be sued.
The pictures remind us of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes struck the United States, causing severe destruction and possibly as many as one hundred deaths.
The explosions left a roughly 320 km long trail of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants are in the walls.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible.
He alone has killed up to a hundred people in the state of Kentucky, and the official figures are constantly increasing.
Hello, I just saw that the #NAME# has been sold.
That is very bad.
Is it still produced?
Or is she completely out of the selection?
Is it possible to order this display in another country?
When are you going to report?
If the delivery does not happen in my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand that I can now order the ceiling and have it delivered to Germany?
I had responded to the contact form with an article back and wanted to know if it was being forwarded or processed, as I hadn't received confirmation yet.
Companies pay vaccination fees and change advertisements
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination levy, companies in Austria have seized the initiative themselves and offered their employees money to be vaccinated.
So they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today demanded financial incentives for an injection.
Even the design of advertisements calling for vaccination - following the example of Germany - is intended to increase the willingness to get vaccinated against coronavirus.
He has changed companies over the years.
That makes his situation worse than yours.
Watch and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He has not even looked at his old position and has been looking for something else.
You should also do that.
And that he didn't like you back then: naja.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please consider the cancellation.
That will be relevant legally.
I finished a screen shot.
Good day - I have interest in the boar's head, white.
Does it also come in 230 cm?

Help with first own campaign
Boron to the wall!
I am currently writing a campaign for a group of four friends, and I want to take them on an adventure through the grasp pass.
We play DSA 5.
The big book is made up of the confessions and motives of the assassins, the individual acts planned and now I am writing the diary of my first encounter, which happened over my own nose.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a forge with axes from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thura Sees.
There will be further action there.
Some miles away from the village, the heroes are supposed to confront a group of goblin warriors and lock them in a corner.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: to appear, to act, to threaten, to recognize danger early, which always surprises the players.
Group strength: 8 common goblin, 2 with spear, 6 with boar and swords
When they don't notice, the goblin heroes crawl up the wall and flank me on three sides, while two of them use spears to stop me.
If it comes to war and the heroes fall, I have two solutions
All the heroes were found unconscious and subsequently by the son of the schoolmaster, a half-brother.
The car is naturally missing.
If a defeat is inevitable, this half-elf uses two of his fists and comes to the aid of the heroes in the fight.
The castle is still there, all super.
How does your Deus ex Machina solve 2?
Is the encounter too much for the adventure?
The group of goblin warriors will later play a decisive role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I hadn't counted on so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely pay attention to your ideas and have more confidence in my narrative.
I have once again dismantled the lamp.
And again together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That is why I would still like to send her back
Then you can put up the shutters and I can bring the lamp to #PRS_ORG#.

Once was the Riss
I'm just sitting there
Here was the lower part, that is, the part with the staircase.
Is everything going to be demolished again or just the wall part?
I am grateful to Sky Sport F1
Hello F1 fans, the quality of the German sky has been getting worse and worse all season, so I wanted to give this post some air.
For the time being, the transfer was broken today in the middle of the F2-competition in order to start the F1 pre-season reporting in time.
Although it was far behind schedule because of the postponed start and the start accident, one could still show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!!).
It appears, however, that for legal reasons the FIA take precedence and that is why all the other things have to be restricted, so that Sky DE did not have a choice.
Despite that, Sky UK have managed to carry on the race.
Despite that, a small praise: The commentator Olivier Zwartyes has handled the difficult situation well.
Then there was the time when F1 commentator Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher were unaware that you could change the engine under a red flag.
Although this situation has already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, it was only when corresponding fun facts about this topic were given to Hamilton that the decision was made to change Verstappen's tires.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators were aware that this possibility exists for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that one should simply know such elementary rules when one is commenting on F1 on pay TV.
It is not the first time this has happened, which now, according to the rules, is possible or has been registered, and both have simply standing uncertainties regarding the rules.
Generally speaking, it does not go well with the artificial commentary style of Roos, but given that it is the taste that is the problem.
But I think Heiko Wasser of RTL is even better.
This is where the amateur actors come in, who just seem unprofessional, like when Peter Hardenacke orders coffee or when Ralf Schumacher's "uuuuHD" comes on.
Especially the last one brings a lot of noise into the comment that he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, the promotion is simply over at Sky, where Sky is the only broadcaster to advertise, as you can hear in F1TV, with only the German soundtrack and no commentary coming directly after the race.
Weder ServusTV noch ORF tun das.
These two broadcasters also do less advertising in training than Sky, and that as free TV broadcasters.
Although you must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, which alone does not allow me to see the consequences.
The other program of Sky Sport F1 is also very tough and full of repetitions.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel, which overpowers F1.
Unironically, RTL is getting a better job with the four races they still have to win.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be with a normal broadcaster.
My opinion would interest you.
On the subject: #PRS_ORG#-Records, Messing and more colorful glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me on Monday that the second lady told me yesterday that she was going to check an email and send it and she never did.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on December 12, 19.
One of them has already proven a defect after relatively short time (the material has a hole in the upper part of the shaft).
I would like support.
Heavy pumping is suitable for supplying an aquarium with salt water.
It is also possible to use a filter system via a fan.
This series is offered in three variants.
Check the table at the end of the offer.
Here you can compare the performance.
If the pumps are strong enough, they can drive entire plants.
If you have a large aquarium, you can pump with two or more outlets so that you can connect several speakers.
The MK-series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model, but you can also opt for a loudspeaker (available in our shop) or a decor that converts the airblades into a function.
This would be a treasure trove, musket or similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low noise levels.
The installation is very simple.
The loudspeaker is connected to an amplifier via a coaxial cable 4/6 mm in diameter... and can already be removed.
The loudspeaker should be as loud or louder than the waterfall.
If the lure is placed deeper than the water depth, a return ventilator should be used.
All you have to do is to divide the smoke through the ventilator.
This would prevent water from backing up, which is what happens when water runs down the drain...
If the loudspeaker is to be placed in the open air, it should be covered and protected against the sun
The pump of the MK series is a pure energy package that consumes little energy
Even if we specify the processing time with 3 days on eBay, it is packed every day and the packages are also taken away every day.
Everything is going well, it's very fast.
We just want to give people a little warning so that no one is surprised.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for the entire staff, who also work in the logistics...of course, there is no Corona here.
Please do not rate immediately bad, just because the delivery is delayed, which is only on the package services.
Of course, one would like to talk about these services, even if we are saying... they are really difficult
This is also very regional.
You are nobody, stay healthy and we all hope that it will bring better times.
How long does it take to order the same thing with and without an arm?
Can you also buy the shoes in hell?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first American passenger on board, a TV host and four other passengers took a short flight into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "Blue Origin" of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the western US state of Texas.
Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the astronauts as they returned home.
Welcome back," Bezos said in a blue suit as he opened the Luke capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually emerged and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled for ten minutes and thirteen seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923- 1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin was named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were guests of the company that paid the other four passengers for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each person paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He worked hard on his assignments and had to do everything himself.
She was just flown around, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Even Michael Strahan was enthusiastic.
He would love to go back to the All, said the moderator.
New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometers high
The "Rocket System New Shepard" is generally automated.
The capsule, which during the flight was separated from the rocket, reached a height of around 100 kilometres above Earth, at times with extreme violence, before the reusable object crash-landed on large parachutes.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers as the limit for space, but there is no binding international agreement.
It was already the third all-out Blue Origin flight: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old German.
On October 2, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who gained fame with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the business with space tourism far ahead of any scientific research interests of the human race and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry
I am studying biochemistry at the moment in my first semester and find the subject quite fascinating and, in the laboratory, I do not get dizzy at all (I have already taken organic chemistry practicals).
Of course, before the study, I had already thought about my career prospects. However, at the time, I also still thought that I wanted to study for promotion.
At present, however, I have doubts, especially about my professional prospects.
On one hand (Studycheck etc.), you always hear super job prospects and the job is totally searched for, on the other hand, you always hear about unemployed biologists and unpaid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested in:
What is your current job?
Are you happy with your work/ salary?
(3) What have you studied/ What training have you done?
(4) Are you going to do it again?
Thanks for your answers!
I am currently quite uncertain and am considering dropping out of college in 2022 and enrolling in a program in computer science.
If you have experience, write it down:)
Extra stress before holidays and weekends
This topic came up last week.
But now I have to use my long weekend to relax.
This is the first step.
Not only before major holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is a lot of pressure in our service.
As it seems, there will also be more bridge days.
It was this: Last week, Maria Himmelfahrt, who is known in Switzerland as "the pilgrim", was with us.
On Friday, most people and businesses will be celebrating a bank holiday, which is semi-official.
Last week was therefore a long 4-day weekend at home.
What happened last week?
All stress.
Even louder emails, which had to be deleted immediately, requests here, requests there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... why?
Because "next week then" sounds like a lot of time and that's not right?
Or because people want to work as hard in a compressed week as they would in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also fatigued.
What is the reason for this self-murder?
Where did we even get the idea of having holidays if we can't go on them?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very self-centered.
My question is simple: Are only we Swiss?
Is this our reformed evangelical art?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld rejoices on Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is delighted on Christmas in her native Thuringia - but has no tricks up her sleeve.
The actress and singer Hit Radio FFH said, "The sun, even if it should not be shining in Erfurt, then one would simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian forest."
She will be dancing at the festival once again, this time with her son.
I love this, said Catterfeld.
She still has a lot to do before the wedding, though: "For the first time, I have no plans, I must finally get ready."
NEKTON-Bio supports a free flow of the gun and ammunition.
NEKTON-Bio contains all the vitamins, amino acids, minerals and trace elements necessary for life in addition to 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a glossy and shiny feathers.
The majority of the defects in vocal performance are due to dietary errors.
Because the feeder is made from durable material, it is a particularly rich source of vitamins and minerals for the development of a free-flying chick.
For a functioning change of fuel, the daily food must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the course of the experiment are due to malnutrition or lack of vitamins and minerals.
The unbalanced amino acid composition in most plant-based foods is explicitly taken into account and compared in the case of NEKTON-Bio.
While using NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamins should be taken.
NEKTON-Bio is biodegradable and can be disposed of in the sewage system or in a landfill.

Still not working
DDR freight locomotive Altbau E 95 03 DRG/DR, the loco was in Schlesien and Mitteldeutschland in use, the very rare loco is probably the result of the demolition of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with play marks and defects, good function The E 95 section is a heavy freight locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the treatment of heavier coal loads in the Schlesicnet, possibly the loco is also from the small goods company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are working on it
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn company commissioned the AEG to put forward proposals for a locomotive powered by electricity, which was to be able to propel 2,200 tonnes at 45 km/h along this stretch.
The highest speed was 65 km/h.
Therefore, in March 1926, the DRG specified the delivery as 1’Co+Co1’ Locomotive with diesel-electric traction AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, which Siemens Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were numbered E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves in the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany in November 1952.
At the state-of-the-art depot in Dessau, the locomotives were put through their paces.
In 1959, as the demand for locomotives for the heavy goods train service increased due to the continuing electrification of the middle German network, the three locomotives E 95 01, E 95 02, and E 95 03 were put into service, with the other machines being used as spare parts.
At first, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are in greater quantity, were preferred.
Only when approaching the E 94 was it not possible to continue the work, and the E 95 became the focus of the work.
First, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to work at the Halle P. in 1960.
They were mostly used on their way to Kohlenzwick in Richtung Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated steering of the locomotives proved problematic with increasing age.
This is often the case when guns are involved in smuggling.
Then the foreman, who was driving on this locomotive, had to loosen the guns while the train was in motion with a hammer and a chisel.
Damage to the locomotive's engine often leads to months of breakdowns.
[5] At the end of the 1960s, when there were enough new locomotives on hand, and there was no clear plan to expand the electric power industry at that time, the Federal Railroad was able to abandon its old locomotives and most of its freight cars, so that the E 95 was decommissioned.
As a result, the Deutsche Reichsbahn electric locomotives were only to be operated by one man, which led to problems with the machines and the view from the driver's seat.
After the middle of 1969, the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were closed, and the last one, the E 95 01, was closed on October 5, 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives have been removed from the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was put in place as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a weeping wall at the main station Halle.
It took some time before the railway authorities could convince themselves that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first public display of the locomotive was held with the aim of being able to display it as a rolling stock in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been classified as a non-operational museum locomotive at the Dresden Transport Museum.
In 1986, the locomotive was completely completed.
At the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is being treated as a museum piece.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have worked on the maintenance of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw in Arnstadt, with new internal and external decoration, during which the transformers were examined and five locomotive engines were operational.
The locomotives were used on the Schlesische Gebirgsbahn and the surrounding branch lines until 1945, where they were renowned for their reliable operation and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to the middle German network.
The main focus was initially on Schlesien
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, Good function, it is necessary to have optical rework on the site in own work, buried, with traces of grease, very rare handicraft model, very small floor area - possibly the floor area is also from the small department store ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can show labels and stickers.
Yes, the F parts are there
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle balk is held by two fingers. Unfortunately, these are too small and the balk cannot be mounted on the fingers.
What are we going to do now?
I can't build the bed.
The midfielder is held by two feet, which are unfortunately faulty.
The midfielder does not fit into the proposed formation.
So I got new.
Where are they going to send them?
No, not flat.
According to the montage direction, these are the correct ones from the form, they were just too small
But that's not the case.
Their main purpose is to fulfill their purpose
They are not weak with me
Can I get this shipped?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire at a house in Oberbayern.
In addition, a considerable damage was caused in the six-star Eurobereich, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had spread from the carport to the neighboring house in Kinsau (district of Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reportedly brought to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not think it was an arson.
The police in Fürstenfeldbruck have taken over the investigation.
But it comes much later
And I still have to pay shipping costs
To counter fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Until now, Biontech chief Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo of his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a boyfriend had caused him to move, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the German company Biontech, Ugur Sahin, has published a photo showing how he is being vaccinated against the coronavirus.
There were false information on social media that I was not imprisoned.
In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network.
"Since a few months, my friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me being cuffed, to counter these false rumors."
Until now, he had refused because he thought the communication was not about him.
But a phone call last week had changed his mind: "I was deeply shocked when I heard that an old schoolmate was currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The schoolboy and his family were not arrested, Şahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often caused by inaccurate information and lack of trust."
Fear makes it difficult to fight facts, sometimes better to share personal experiences.
In an interview with Deutsche Welle, Uğur Şahin says he is not guilty.
However, the video was released in December 2020, as well as the Deutsche Welle itself.
At that time, Şahin said, “It is not legal for me to get the vaccine myself.”
In Germany, a priority is given to the closure of the nursing home.
Meanwhile, the priority has long been raised - and according to some information, the Biontech boss has given up three times.
Fire in power plant: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday night: no electricity, no heating in many cases.
A fire had broken out at a power station.
After a fire with severe damage in a cooling station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia will have to wait around 24 hours without electricity.
The fire caused the evacuation of more than 41,000 people in several communes on Friday evening.
The WestNetz provider reported that on Saturday numerous fiber-optic cable aggregates were put into service until the large-scale disturbance was finally lifted late at night.
The fire brigade and helpers and helpers of the THW provided support to the communes.
The authorities offered support positions in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The defendant apologized to the victims for their wrongdoing and to the helpers for their involvement.
We are aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We are also grateful to the affected communes, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their unremitting efforts, said the head of the Primärtechnik department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few days, as the Westnett Mounted Police were only able to restore some of their services provisionally, he said.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Power flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at around 5.15 p.m. severely damaged the 10,000 volt circuit at the Neunkirchen Seelscheid power plant.
There are necessary maintenance and repair works there.
This was paralleled by an attachment to a 30,000 volt power line.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back again.
Since Saturday at 8 p.m. more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have been supplied with electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually evacuated from 21.30 p.m.
Since 23:15, the affected power supply has also been restored.
Over 80 Westnetz and partner firms were deployed.
The authorities had also called in neighborhood assistance after building a power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
It is important that citizens contact their local fire department or police if they need help, stated County Commissioner Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
At the installation and operation of the wind turbines, the residents of Altenheimen were particularly at risk.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care positions have been placed in schools for those people who cannot take care of themselves or who require medical equipment for medical treatment.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy it and pay in euros?
It is the Tagesdecke #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day and stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount it on the table.
It's a custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions.
We wanted to record that with a CD
We have 155 cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I cannot open it and therefore cannot shrink it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise, I would have to return it, as it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be delighted to receive a reply
That is really easier!
Then we will do it!
Do you send me the return receipt by mail?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, I had not restarted the E-#PRS#ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find a signature like that almost incomprehensible.
So we are not satisfied
Nordic combination: Combiner wins
The German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Estonia's Otepää.
The duo had to deal with the leading Norwegian, Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the ski jump with a large lead over his competitors.
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be returned to my account?
Yes, we have both updated and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they often have problems
I have not directly bought a book with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems.
If I want to open it, the notification comes, ups!
This document cannot be opened.
The file may be incorrectly registered with the customer service.
As long as I can recognize it, it is an #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me further?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I must also work!
This way, the coloring matter will be evenly distributed and clean, you should rinse and scrub the wooden parts with a little soap water, add clear water if necessary.
Before you start to paint the pin with a new color, it is recommended to practice with two or three strokes.
This can no longer be done on the internal side of the building, or on a toaster.
The first nail on the wall
Put the pin in the same place every time.
The slight overlap of the color layers later leads to a fairly large area.
Hide quickly up and down the stairs with the pin.
This leads to unrealistic areas.
A model is not a gardening expert.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark could only be seen later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come to a close with a separate pin.
Otherwise, they can become beautiful metal shards if they mix with normal colors.
Before you discard the parts, let them sit for a day.
The models achieve their original appearance through the decals and detachable images.
From airplane decals to boat names and car stickers, the decals give the model the final touch.
Put the decals in the right order, as long as the components are still good.
It is possible to live in a cockpit of a plane or a helicopter before it is dismantled.
Still more important than the right tool is time, experience and a calm hand.
Schneide each needed a decal and put them on Dir.
Decals are also called waterproof pictures because you peel them back with water until the backing paper is wet.
Then you just take a small piece of paper and stick it to the corresponding spot on the model (which you also marked off before).
While you hold the decal to the model with a work tool, you pull the carrier paper away from you.
Warning: Always check that the image is correctly positioned before you completely cut it out of the paper, so that it doesn't slip, knit or even tear.
The water is contaminated with sewage.
Not suitable for children under 3 years old
I can only open a book for a short time, once I fall asleep then I can't read the book anymore and I have to log out and sign in again and load the book and search for the place I have read.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I get this by email?
Even for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 individual packages to me
Still, many thanks!
Then I'll buy something else as soon as I get my money back.
But am I the problem?
Child abuse in PKV / What is a "Insurance fall"?
Hello together,
We were in child protection for some time, but now that we are about to be separated from the PKV, this suddenly came to light.
The sequence is:
We had applied for the child placement at the PKV in advance and received the promise over 3 attempts.
The attempts were limited in some way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth, and was rejected with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and carried out 2 (failed) attempts to get pregnant, but we were not able to do so with the PKV.
We again applied for the cost reimbursement at the PKV and received 3 more attempts.
After several more attempts (we performed more attempts than agreed, logically the highest with the PKV), we reached the accounts at the PKV and got the good surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to admit 3 attempts.
The justification is that with the pregnancy/birth, the other two attempts to the first commitment failed.
The second child is a new insurance case.
However, according to AGB, "the insurance event starts with the medical treatment, it ends when treatment needs no longer exist."
The questions to the experts in the round:
Who has the right to the PKV (only 3 attempts are allowed) or us (we are 5 attempts)?
Does the PKV have to point out in the agreements that with a birth the other attempts have failed?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to blocked fallopian tubes) will not be cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would share their opinion here.
Many thanks for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants via email and tell me how I can get the best out of them
In order.
We will not order anything more from them.
When they add my and my boyfriend #NAME# (same address)'s offers, they obviously have good customers.
They should continue to do so with their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the refund had been requested and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back.
I can hardly believe it, my stomach is completely full
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote
It is clear and obvious that the refund was requested and I have still not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
They can instruct their manager that they have lost two regular customers.
My boyfriend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment from his account.
We won't do that anymore.
No, the defect has not occurred for some months.
An office chair must be used normally.
They cannot sell him as a sofa.
Whether independent of this, the service life of 24 months applies.
No, that is not possible for me.
I will demolish the wall and place it at the disposal of the transnational company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are sold with additional shoes, but we unfortunately cannot find them for you.
Can they help?
The theme of the week: the best low budget films
What is a low-budget film, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little or no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web, one can richly listen to low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know your interesting representatives of this category?
What drives you?
And what about you?
I am a very good customer for you, I have already completed two apartments with your furniture.
If you want to ask for the best price for the grey couch, Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended once again, is this also accurate?
Many thanks
With friendly greetings
If there is no telephone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing has changed in the waiting position...I will then give it another try because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
Half a victory against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Russian regime.
However, the costs are very high and represent massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees in Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation, the researcher from the Berlin-based Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) explained.
This web state - Belarus is not quite small, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to last for a while.
The handling of the people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong reported.
It seems that there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not committed to this, it will cost the basic rights.
This development also weakens the cohesion in the Union.
"She can't seem to get her head around the fact that a member state is digging its own grave," as is currently the case with Poland, which has not once allowed the EU border protection agency Frontex to gain access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong says: A fundamental agreement on asylum policy has been weakened because the line "safeguard, safeguard, safeguard" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to information from the Polish border protection, migrants have been trying to get to Poland via Belarus.
55 migrants had been arrested and deported to the border on Sunday, a spokesman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were thrown with stones by the migrants near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
Overall, 52 attempted border crossings were registered within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had already breached the border fence.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the Belarus-EU border or attempted to do so in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of being a dictator in Minsk, accusing him of locking the EU out.
According to Polish and Lithuanian press reports, border crossings were closed.
The EU imposed sanctions on Belarus and threatened airlines that brought migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioner for Home Affairs are responsible for preventing people from leaving their home countries.
The most visible element of the EU response is the pressure on air routes, Bossong said.
′′ The EU has thrown its market power into the wind and shown its resolve with tough sanctions and extraterritorial sanctions ".
In addition, Minsk must also consider internal political costs.
The Belarusian society does not seem to be aware that the security forces regularly shoot thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen should have passed two times during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has made an appeal.
The silvers are usually awarded to two riders in the last Grand Prix of the season.
The protest focuses on Max Verstappen's controversial driving during the final safety car phase in the Red Bull, when he should have been avoided at all costs.
Another appeal was lodged against the assessment at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes in the last lap and was close to winning his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place just after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Niederländer had overtaken his car.
I am testing this.
I talk to the bank and report to you again
Thanks for the support
Free entry for members: Europa Park hosts SC Freiburg Fantag
The Europa Park, named after the Europa Park stadium of the Freiburg sports club, has been transferred to the Freiburg sports club.
As the park shared, members of the sports club and day pass holders from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were coupons for drinks and sausages.
On this day, the lower deck was illuminated by the red and white smoke.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white air balloons made the perfect climax, said the park.
Cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the Freizeitpark in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa Park, it has once again been shown how good the partnership is.
Seeing the scattered fans having fun in the back garden confirms that," says Europe Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is this €#NUMBER# and not 1699€ as originally?

I had a lot of problems with you back then, when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# amplifier.
Judith Hermann wrote from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading tour, author Judith Hermann visited the Blue Note on Friday, where she was moderator of her current novel "Daheim".
She is dead, lives in a house on the coast, and sleeps sensitively to the nocturnal sounds of her door.
I submitted the contact form to withdraw an article yesterday, but I didn't receive an email confirmation or anything.
My question is whether my request has been accepted.
It does not have the time for your complained chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you are covering up and not all of our household expenses.
Contact the woman #NAME#.
I can't talk to them every day
We had agreed yesterday that I would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a new order for the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
This email has not yet been received.

This is like a snitch saying he has nothing against foreigners.
They will not admit it.
But colleagues reproduce constantly antisemitic messages.
If you want to get away, you should just leave it.
Yes, then you are similar to a colleague.
Anyone who seriously questions the evolution is simply lost.

But once you become a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And so you are a science enemy and not to be taken seriously as a colleague
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the lens should be as close as possible to the eye.
The specially flattened and chromatically adapted lens system allows you to use the lupes up to the edge of the field without registration and color errors.
Lups are often marked with enlargement data.
These data only apply to exactly defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the use conditions.
In order to be able to use your luggage optimally, we kindly ask you to pay attention to the information in the table "Technical data" (see use instructions in the packaging).
On the lens surface of all optical instruments - including eyeglasses - there are light reflexes.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
In order to maintain the optimal conditions for use - Lupe is in front of the lens - the reflections on the floor are less noticeable.

Tanning sale in Schönwolde: Women search for Christmas trees in the commune of Krembz
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some bizarre situations at the slaughterhouse.
Once a man is even supposed to be able to get home alone, because they cannot agree on anything.
Each year, he plants around 2000 plants.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some bizarre situations.
That makes the Advent season always a little bit fun, he says.
And that with the coupon?
Otherwise, I'm a customer?!
However, I received a defective delivery and now pay the full price for it.
Then I'll judge it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
They both consist of meat that is cooked on a spit.
And both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be "Dreher", which does not sound so cute at all.
Problems with laser + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass door for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which has been free of errors up to a few cases.
The new broadband connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, will also receive this.
However, the other DLAN module, which is connected to the WiFi, no longer receives the full 500, but I remove the module from the house, the less it comes (so I use a dose that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet is now even slower than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similar big losses.
Can someone explain to me why the internet speed through the power line is so much faster with a laser?
Is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely inconvenient to have to move LAN cables around the house.
I am really overwhelmed, which is why I have created an extra account.
That is why I am so much more interested in an answer.
When is the time to change the Giro account
If you had thought that there would be some peace at the Giro accounts now, you are mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm past fee increases to their customers with all sorts of tricks, the interest rates for negative deposits are also falling further.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, had a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the freebie amount and even turned it into a daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was only for customers of the group's postal bank - up to 50,000 euros for current and savings accounts and 25,000 euros for day-to-day accounts.
However, these low interest rates are now affecting the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "individual new agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already run up a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at ING Germany.
Direct bank DKB, which is currently targeting cost-conscious customers, has reduced the amounts it offers in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
Nevertheless: According to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks have a minimum amount of 25,000 euros or less.
Even the Sparda Bank Berlin has reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which have even obtained legal action against this regulation in the first instance before the Berlin State Court.
Now banks are already discussing whether they should be allowed to set off against each other any refunds they receive - in the event that the top layers also have to account for the negative balances in principle, and have to return many billions to bank customers.
The table for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people.
That is for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is a journey of a thousand miles.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, this success is directly due to a lot of hard work and dedication.
An entire army of assistants, stylists and trainers are responsible for her appearance.
Still, like Aniston, she can get a chip on the day (yes, really: a single chip from the bag).
It is a miracle that their hearts still beat at the same rate.
Perhaps because she is simply lucky - and still searching for love.
And the baby's wish has come true.
Previously, she had been asked repeatedly when she was going to have a child.
That hurt her.
Those who asked had no idea what was going on medically or why I was not able to.
It was really injured.
It remains to be hoped that success and humility will also be happy.
Unworthy end of a career - Räikkönen must resign
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even more quiet than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old fisherman threw up his hands and died of his wounds.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight touch, Räikkönen had to leave his Alfa Romeo halfway through the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "iceman" ending his career in the motor sport class.
At his farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children were also with him.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the World Championship in Ferrari in 2007.
He won 21 Grand Prix races, started 18 times from pole position and came to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup goal - Nolte scores in double - Sports
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories is the goal of the pilot.
I have calculated this many times, I would have to win nine titles in a row to be able to compete at the 2026 Cortina Games, said the BSC Oberbärenburg double Olympic champion, who won two races in Winterberg in two days.
He defended the attack of Johannes Lochner only on Saturday, in which he was ranked third.
Then he changed the material setting slightly and went out in 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
Together with his team, Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he defeated British competitor Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We took a greater risk today and were rewarded, said Friedrich, who also scored his 22nd goal of the season.
The Berchtesgaden native Johannes Lochner, who was travelling to Stuttgart, came in fifth place after two.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race in eighth place.
If I knew what he was doing, I would do it too, Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
On her way home from work, Laura Nolte took the third win of the season in the women's doubles.
After reaching fourth place in the monobloc on the previous day, she raced to the world cup victory with anchorwoman Deborah Levi on Sunday.
Zweierbob-Olympiasiegerin Mariama Jamanka of the BRC Thüringen came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, in second place.
She recorded the first podium finish of the season alongside her Olympic qualification.
The Wiesbaden native Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool to be the first woman in the world cup, I am super happy that Mariama picked me.
I'm super excited about the development.
There is still a lot of potential, but today's start times were okay," said Burghardt, emphasizing that "it is not just pushing, but there is a lot to do".
Jamannka was a little annoyed by the not entirely faultless driving, but said: "It is going in the right direction".
I already had the ceiling in the cupboard and could now buy it!!!
What should I do?
I have not received it and therefore cannot release it, so I finally asked.
Last year, I had completely different problems and never had time for that.
And now it was revealed that he had cheated me.
You can watch the chat about the Asare Sitzbank.
I want to return it and then order again, because it's currently reduced.:)
Why was the ship only launched on 16 March?
There was no such long delivery time on your website
No, not until I call
She was taken away from her colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the false alarm.
But we still want to keep the gift module, just a new undamaged one
And not the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello ladies and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write and maybe it is the one - or the other...
I'm 24, have a degree in computer science, full-time student and dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or is actually 1 to 1 my kid.
My boyfriend (since 6 years) is sick, had a 2 grade burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and I want to see and feel him, we have been kissing a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him clean (because hand is in association with burning).
He is colder than usual and we see less (1 to 2 weeks) what with my needs for affection and love.
My dog is barking, I have been drinking for him and he is lying down in his crate and has become a bit more relaxed after I put the music on and sang for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and they are away for a month.
Now, of course, there is housework to be done, which we naturally did.
But even eating is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS illness is currently in remission, I am being treated for half a year, and I am doing well.
Not good, but I'm coming clean and I'm almost symptom free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15 I have a written test I have not done yet and over the weekend I have been preparing for my anatomy exam.
And next week, on Tuesday, I will have a mandatory exam, and what is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no place left.
So my week goes like this: Only until over the weekend, then it's the weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the holidays begin.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so this continues forever.
I think I'm just stressed enough right now that I need those mental reminders because otherwise I forget.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do anything about it...
Does it work for you?
Honestly, I am thankful that I don't have to work.
I really can't thank them enough.
I don't know if I would have survived without it.
I believe that has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find some passionate lovers here...
I wish you a relaxing evening anyway, the week is almost over!
I got my order today, unfortunately the whole other color plus the surface is cracked and the tabletop has a bump.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we move the table now, I'll get another color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26, #NUMBER#.
In the other two.
She was not confirmed.
Once was completely different: When I was in school, many religious students did not believe in God, and it was just another subject for them, like math or geography.
That was always strange for me, maybe because I was christened and always believed in something.
How are you doing?
Perhaps you can also tell stories with colleagues from work or study.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is easy to separate.
Doesn't even have a lesson plan.
But it seems odd to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in relativity theory.
What is the point of studying religion if one does not believe in it?
Is culture or something else?
Hoffe's question is not private.
Can it not be changed or not? Write English, I also understand it well
That is very long, so I would ignore it
It's good, thanks.
I am expecting a response by the earliest possible chance next week.
Thanks for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please
Hello people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
In the film there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern world (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead)(not quite sure).
Because I cannot describe it in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the Caribbean).
For some reason, the roads intersect and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this kingdom so he can live himself.
I also believe that this is the soldier's grave.
At the end, the two soldiers fight each other.
If you say that, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has only been sleeping on the couch for a week.
Fast forward: still alive: D
Relax.
So a child holds much more than you think.
He worries that everything is going wrong, that there are no whistleblowers, that they rarely investigate or look into things, but that they do not monitor minutes.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mate.
No kisses.
We didn't have a mattress, but we always had a mattress pad.
Watch your child when they are playing.
Does it point to the head?
Can something fall from the ceiling?
Or is it directly in the face?
You can then check that everything is in order.
We have all grown up and as my husband became a father, it dawned on me that you put kids to sleep on the couch.
In addition, we are already "stockists" for you and have already bought a lot of articles
But why are you only offering me 20 euros?
Hello, I wrote to you yesterday with a colleague and so far no reply.
It's about my skirt, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right wing bloc does not fit in the ranks.
I would like to contact you as soon as possible.
The crack is currently not to be used.
To put it simply.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply that the politics of this sender is now at an all-time low.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then you go on a big tour at the same time.
It was said that he was an "independent" Internet provider.
Arno quote: "You don't want to be a 'running gag'."
What is the current situation?
An 0815 advertiser who is trying to get his billboard to the elite fans.
And then we have Marahs Do's and Don'ts.
Of course for everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, people must be blamed.
One man who completely lacked empathy and tried to make a profit from the action with the exploding rooms.
How should you find everything?
If you like it, I find it charming.
I would like a refund, as my delivered oven was defective.
Opening of the #PRS_ORG# corpus.
Whether as a bell on the roof or just for decoration - my little heating friend is very versatile.
Chestnuts are a traditional winter food for warmth, as chestnuts can store and release heat very well.
The penetrating inner core can easily be heated in the microwave or in the back of the oven.
The wide angle makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the small ones feel at home even if it does not always go well with them.
The kerf cutter attachment is suitable for the following application areas:
Before the kiss, they examine each other's faces for unusual smells, stains, or burns, and immediately concern themselves with the person they are about to kiss.
Please take a look at the inner workings before warming up!
In the microwave at maximum 300 watts for maximum 2 minutes (as specified by the microwave manufacturer!)
The heat is evenly distributed through the roof!
After that, the internal investigation was reopened.
At the first warming, a slight fog can form on the surface, but this disappears after repeated applications.
You must definitely take the given precautions, as they can lead to longer exposure times or higher energy outputs (the risk of ignition and burning!).
Before heating the cake in the microwave, make sure that the manufacturer's instructions for using the microwave oven allow for the cooking of cake.
After warming up the insides, put them back in the freezer until you're ready to use them!
Do not use the needle for acute and chronic, contagious or febrile illnesses, for minor cuts and wounds, for people with compromised immune systems.
If you are pregnant, breastfeeding, have HIV/Aids, diabetes, or cancer, or are planning to become pregnant, consult a doctor before using any medication.
If sewers have opened and lost their core, you will be concerned about the product and the lost core immediately and inaccessible for children.
If the product is applied to babies under one year old, the temperature of the child should be regularly monitored during the application to prevent overheating!
All cases of serious incidents related to the product are to be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authorities of the country in which the consumer lives.
The fabric is breathable and washable at 30 degrees.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 dreams of returning to the Bundesliga.
At the same time, Hannover 96 is working from the bottom of the table.
For Ingolstadt, the third coach is also not working.
Joy in Darmstadt after late victory in the Snooker, happiness in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the disappointing start under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded through my network.
I bought this about five months ago, so it should still work.
I thought that network alone is sufficient for operation.
The battery is dead and the laptop won't turn on anymore, despite the fact that it's plugged in.
Then I switched the battery, but nothing happened.
Does she have an idea?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop online?
Is anything broken?
Many thanks for your help!
I want to deliver the #PRS_ORG# to my room.
How can I book?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seating area is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V 2 Backpack from Peak Design!
The 20-liter fuel tank can also be used to store larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be secured with the help of the fixed flexfold panels.
And what else do you need on everyday items, remains well organized thanks to practical closet doors in the individually configurable internal room.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The minimalist design speaks for itself—with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some of the most innovative solutions to securely protect the contents of the backpack and still allow access to the contents in seconds.
This has two possibilities: Either conventionally over the top the flap, which can be closed with the magnetic latch system, or a highly effective solution for protection that has already been mentioned for the messenger bags.
Inside the closure flap is a metal closure clip with matching anchors on the front side of the bag.
Contrary to most lanyards, Peak Design has considered several "filling factors": there are four anchor points, which are stable and can be used to attach the lanyard.
If the backpack is full, just take the top handle, if it's rather light, a tighter one.
Clapboard and rafters are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can also be securely closed without having to fasten the straps.
The second possibility also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, photo-op backpacks: In addition to the zipper closure, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of common household ladders - you don't have to crawl through the content anymore!
At the same time, this small detail dramatically increases the portability of the bag: If you don't only take your camera, but also everyday items or a travel bag with you.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the internal space (see below) and store both problems neatly away - and access them independently via the two side openings.
This way, you can also pull the backpack off the right side of the body to gain access, for example, to the camera setup on the right main façade, while the food items remain safely in the left backpack half and don't get lost.
Bequeme, unkompliziert verstellbarer Tragegurte helfen dabei.
And since the outside pockets of the backpack are also made of 100 percent recycled, waterproof nylon, the content itself stays dry even if you're going to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I waited for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email confirming the transfer yesterday
Contact has been made with the shipping company since the delivery of the incorrect product was announced.
Until now, I have not received any news.
I would like immediate withdrawal.
I am now writing with the third support employee, and at no point did I get further than confirmation that I received an email.
It is about the return of the wrong custom #NAME#
It is therefore necessary to consider when the patient can be discharged.
Keeping him is not an option for me...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
Wishes you a beautiful evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I got a completely different lamp as I ordered
Please call me
If you extend my voucher, I'll immediately give you a bigger order, but I'll keep the damaged item and not return it.
And I could not have imagined that last year was going to be any different than planned, and I could not have imagined that it would not have been possible to clear and explain it in time.
But as a customer, I do not accept the damage.
Rotinger brake pads are designed for the claims of the dynamic driver, who wants to ensure safety and reliability even under difficult conditions.
Rotin brake pins are pulled out of the ground and then mechanically worked (bent and cut).
All the slivers are cut into short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain slivers and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawings, a special manufacturing program is created that is tailored to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The bolts secured in this way provide high comfort and brake effectiveness.
The additional openings also increase the efficiency of the cooling system, with the sections improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic characteristics of our discontinued models underline the character of each car with its attractive and eye-catching appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event changed the history of the West Coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered a blaze in the water at the southern tip of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news quickly spread and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of 1949.
Thousands came from all over the country and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and most floriferous cities in the country.
Places were sealed off, walls were knocked down, and saloons and hotels collapsed almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust!"
In this game, you are a pioneer who is searching for wealth in the west and wants to make a name for himself.
You will search for gold, hire workers, combine horses, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding areas and rivers.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You must meet your pioneering colleagues to avoid conflicts with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many reasons to win.
At the same time, you choose your actions, you have to hold their resources and build a table that works more and more for you (called "engine building").
The buildings on your table allow you to become more efficient, take additional actions or use rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge, you can help develop your individual style.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California became an official state).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
Each round will see the players select a location on the board where they can take actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
When a location has most of the pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates one half of the stand - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns acting out actions, such as winning resources, driving cars, setting traps, searching for rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and placing revolvers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers will return.
At the beginning of each round, the bidder has to select a new location and change the available actions.
This goes on for a long time, until the caller has moved five times, that is, each location has been covered once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players must defend themselves against angry gang members.
When the players have shot enough revolvers at the bandits and paid them out of proportion, they receive awards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shot, then the final score is calculated.
The player with the most points wins!
When sending free of charge, I take up to 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm, which is the size of a handkerchief (folded).
With everything else, most of which is DPD, and with delivery tracking (games are opened, cards are folded and packed paper).
If you are a collector, I can also send you a box for 2 euros, which is 100% free of charge.
Why children are not tyrants, Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has now appeared in my Twitter timeline, and I immediately looked at it.
The child psychotherapist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest in talk shows and holds positions in Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Are Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce educational debate.
Former patient: inner and educational rights are now being raised against him.
Please remember that the film is difficult to bear.
And I'm very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
We parents and other responsible persons should never, never, never try to get power over the child.
Our goal must always be to provide the child with enough room to develop and a framework as large as possible in line with the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: States warn about test duty for three times convicted
The health ministers of the states want to decide at their next meeting about a common approach to enforcing the test law for three times convicted.
We need clarity on when and for how many times tests must be carried out, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, to the "Bild am Sonntag".
Holetschek said that the fall of 2G plus was "not only medically sensible, but also an additional incentive to get vaccinated".
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will make a proposal to the Health Minister's Conference on the following Tuesday". − afp
So I want to return the lamp
How do I best deal with this?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can't get enough of my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Ups, it was a mistake.
The #PRS_ORG# page on the computer is being purchased.
I have updated the database.
Where can this lie?
What you describe as *awareness*, i.e. sensory perception under full anesthesia.
These are with a frequency of ca. 1 to 1000.
The most common is to hear rustling/crackling, rarely to see images, and even rarer to feel pain.
Relevant for this topic: In cases of anesthesia, the rate of awareness is increased, as the child must be protected from a very deep narcosis until the operation is completed.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned in the narcotics conversation.
Certain types of anesthesia, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), carry a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT** Love everyone, this comment by me describes awareness correctly, but it had no **u/Nitemarex **per definition.
Have read their comment wrong.
But the chair is defective.
The 20 euros do not help at all.
These are legal performance claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
This is also standard practice in e-commerce.
Please check that you at least return the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not responded to.
Still the question.
In the order and invoice, it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The sender is the company #NAME#.
I just called there.
He told me that they only deliver before the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I must cancel the order, because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture in the first place.
Shouldn't I call?
I had a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle 97 years old died
He has become a theater critic and an administrator.
Later he wrote a monumental theatrical history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, pressed hard: "A man gets older."
The diary of a long farewell to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle conducted until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads, "I have already expressed my gratitude for my life here."
There are various types of pallets.
One of the most common are European oak boards, normally used as flooring, which are especially popular in the European Union.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to the statistics of Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria every year is not revealed

Rouladen tips and tricks
I had many delicious tips for the perfect gulasch here a week ago.
That was delicious on Christmas and it was incredibly moist and buttercream!
So thank you again:)
Now I have come to the taste and would like to bake the first time for Christmas.
I will set up a piggy bank tomorrow.
Do you still have any tips for me?
Remark: I have no mouth, but only a big pot.
How is it going now?

Where there are still Christmas trees in Lübeck
For many people, Gans or Ente is part of the Christmas tree and the gifts.
Do they still have no wings?
Now the time is almost up.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas turkey in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a snare drum is relatively warm and heavy.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the valve reactor separation.
With the volume, gain and master volume regulators, you can set the desired pitch and at the same time hold the sound.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique power level regulator that allows you to adjust the sound level without changing the gain or phase.
Already further up, it was stated that one could even use the power level regulator to adjust the performance reserve if necessary.
Thanks to the power level regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The record player can also be used as a line-out.
This signal is processed by a box simulation so that you get an eminent "acoustic" impression even when using a headphone or when recording direct.
You can also connect a CD or MP3 player to the auxiliary input jack so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
There is also a tuner function - you do not therefore need a separate amplifier.
If you also invest in a VFS5 footswitch, you can control the sounds even more conveniently with your feet, adjust the effects "on/off" and change the tempo of the corresponding effects.
This is actually unavoidable for live performance.
With its new power pack, VOX is taking another step towards the future!
But that is not the case with others.
Does it then give you the opportunity to return the lamp?
Is she not enough for a snack?
So I would like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
And the commode?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# stage
If it doesn't work, I would be happy with a refund or coupon.
Under the circumstances, I find a breeder for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need is a lot.
I have already received my delivery and would have known about the screws as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) at the planned location.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worthwhile

Iran sees progress in negotiations over nuclear deal
According to Iran, progress has been made in the negotiations over a renewal of the international nuclear agreement.
Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues to be included in the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", because initially there was no unity over the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the renewal of the agreement continued after almost a week of deadlock.
Participants in the negotiations include representatives of Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia.
Even a US delegation is in Vienna on site, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now has the highest corona infection rate
Thuringia has defeated Saxony and currently holds the highest number of prisoners in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia has the highest number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 people on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants over the past seven days.
In Saxony, which had always been the state with the highest population, this value stood at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the number of inmates in Thuringia was low, but also over 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new cases of Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
On Sunday, 200 patients with Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals.
Weekends can lead to complaints.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and are barely able to cope with the new cases.
I understand that.
As delivery is only possible at the beginning of March, it may not be possible until then.
I must say it and put it on the package and hand it to the post, was that?
Do I have to click, enter, or fill out anything else?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
In my opinion, 8 euros is a lot.
It's time for changes
The Bundestag has welcomed me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why is the post here?
If you look at the activity of the Bundestag over the past few months, you can make one conclusion: It is not existing.
We have come to a winterspring and have opened the summer loft for a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, where is it?
In most cases, this will simply depend on dissatisfaction, as some things have fallen apart and we generally behave badly.
Over the past few days, it has become increasingly clear that many still have their doubts about the Bundestag election.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community is being asked about the Bundestag, which they want to keep alive.
The attack came from u/edizVEVO, who had become known in recent days for his work on this project and has made a name for himself as a master of disguise.
After some discussion and debate, several people from the community decided to revive the project.
However, I would like to once again express my desire to get involved in this project, so that this project can also exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can get together and work on concrete things.
You can access the server through this link.
Objectives:
* How will the Bundestag function in the future?
* What existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we go out in the future?
How should new members be accepted?
How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot something, but that's not bad, because at the end of the day, that's what the discord is for.
If you have the time and inclination, come to Discord, work with us, and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade for you to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clobber for my taste and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered another one for you.
I put it together and thought about this when I took the thin sheet.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I still have a question: the daysheet #PRS_ORG#, is it also overloaded, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty screw will be replaced.
And I beg you to leave now.
I don't have a suitable container, but I can unpack as much as possible for the burial - they need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this works.
#PRS_ORG# can call me at any time to arrange an appointment.
Is there an instruction for the installation?
How long would I have to worry about this and decide whether to return?
How do you respond to the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague, who I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a long time, eats hardly any meat at all now.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years.
When asked if I always wanted to be vegan, and if veganism was a planned step, I honestly replied.
And in fact, I had long thought that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but somehow I realized that I was actually supporting animal agriculture.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that she was covering up for the veganism, then she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and how to reduce her animal cruelty as a vegetarian.
Now I ask myself whether my answer was "bouncy".
How do you respond to the question?
Having the feeling that one is quickly pigeonholed as a vegan and that conflicts arise, without having to justify oneself.
It sounds like a harmonious vegan (;
It is not clear whether this is an exception to § 312d BGB.
Its #PRS_ORG# does not bind you to the legal obligations for remote work.
I am aware of the date on which #PRS_ORG# does not accept my return in person.
Since I cannot be present on site due to the demolition, this cannot be changed.
Could you please suggest an alternative translation?
Since 01.02.#NUMBER#, I have been continuously contacted.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for Water Retreat: 45,000 Euro Incentive from the State
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz issued a call for tenders in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the volunteer fire department Lahnstein in Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, amounts to 135,000 euros.
Good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this, says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The catering truck is being used by the construction company Lahnstein, one of seven companies in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice retention as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one can see the effects of this for a long time: The boom in hotel travel on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the increasing use of the lake as a recreation area.
I bought a book that I could only read for 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, I have synchronised, removed and reloaded the app NONE of this has worked.
I'm frustrated because I have spent a lot of time on the whole thing and am now hoping for help.
OK, that's it.
I would like to order three articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG#.
Can I enter a date in the order process?

Thanks once again for putting yourself in that position, I also spent almost a decade in state service in a similar role, we were even colleagues in the executive, I won't go into any further details!
I always find the question of law and left very reassuring.
In principle, however, one should say that of course the public servant comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
That, of course, even in the special uniform and weapon bearer, people can look right of conservative fascist should also be clear to everyone, that these people can then of course only struggle with the reality that has been born. Of course, this is also clear, because you have of course, alongside the average white, many Germans with a migration background, women, and homosexuals (and therefore, my dear, I no longer wear the overgrown feminist cloak, because there are far fewer of them in the executive than you might think, normal men and women who one does not mention if one does not mention them), and to these people I must and will leave my life, because in doubt, they will save your life or set it aside for you.
But even these fringe groups represent something if, for the first time, it sounds like my experience of a conservative attitude, proud of Germany and feeling slighted by a left-leaning politics, even if this politics purports to treat them fairly. They just want to be treated fairly.
Back to the law, of course, as police and armed forces are also a part of society, and extreme rights can also be found there, that they are allowed to express their opinion there or even to openly oppose any state-sponsored plans that threaten me.
Of course, it comes before the fact that police officers and soldiers, who were often deployed abroad, often paused and even said things that were politically incorrect because of negative experiences.
Even though it is certain that right-wing sympathizers will meet to talk about a rainy day, it is not certain yet.
However, my opinion is well worth fighting for, with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled, and that is good for me, that we could not possibly have right-wing racist and Nazi elements in our ranks!
Yes, I did not understand what the other corvettes were doing on the German side.
Why did this come from England?
When I bought it, it was not sold.
I have already ordered in November.
However, it was confirmed in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I have prepared with #NAME#.
Alternatively, one could send the other #PRS_ORG# corb for #NUMBER# Euros to Germany in black, or is this corb received in Germany somewhere.
I always only see you as a partner firm.
But there are two deep roots on the edge of the wood, which have been filled with something yellow

Ordinary through child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy for a long time.
I am highly disciplined and organized on the job (autonomous, very little free time), but even my whole life has become more difficult than right to maintain clean and orderly living.
There are always phases where everything stays put, and then and whenever I pack and I am packing.
But it is never so "that someone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is not better either, he is just as bad, but mostly he just spends all his money on work and pleasure.
The kitchen is still regularly cleaned as we like to cook.
Now to my question, did you get to become a mother?
But we still haven't worked on it and this question has been occupying me for a long time.
Because for me there is no incentive, it simply does not interest me, as long as there is no visit and, for example, there is always fresh clothing there and the kitchen is usable.
Does one have a greater incentive with children or does one remain sluggish?
I am pleased with your answers.
Exclusive, new, and of high quality as well as anatomically shaped, it offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit, and almost unlimited movement.

Career in social work - as someone with a personality disorder?
I have a degree in software development and have been training for about a year.
However, I am increasingly convinced that this job is not the right one for me, so I have been looking for another job for a long time, and have been studying for social work again and again.
The problem: I have an unstable (or fearful) personality disorder (EPD).
This means that I have no self-esteem and that I am very shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a scientific level, but it is very difficult for me to hold open conversations and I have been told many times that I sound insincere (which I think I have gotten better at).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in the open youth centre, but rather in, for example, the search department or the family centre.
But I don't know if the concrete working day really is as I remember it, and it is hard to find anything about it on the Internet.
The AVPS has already caused problems in my job (emotional problems for me), because it bullies me every time I make a mistake on my code ("simple things that have been forgotten") and it is difficult for me to get help from more experienced colleagues ("by now, I should really know how this works"/"I am really asking for help with my work"/"he must really trust me" etc.).
I will probably have problems in any job, but I wanted to mention it at the job.
But have you ever stopped the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation for this.
I was waiting for an abortion
What do you call it?
When I load a book onto the #PRS_ORG#, the message I #PRS_ORG# authorised this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked if I had received confirmation for my hearing.
The protein in the egg white (protein) is broken down by the bird in its gizzard and then combined with the amino acids in the egg whites to form its own body proteins, which it also needs for digestion.
The formation of a nest and the rearing of young are extremely complex processes that are closely linked to the overall health of the animal.
Please bear in mind that NEKTON-Bio should not be interrupted during the breeding period, as this can lead to disruptions in the egg laying process.
In addition to this moderate dose of NEKTON-Bio, a daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement preparation) was to be continued.

At the beginning, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given, until the approach of the surgical intervention becomes visible.
Afterwards, the normal dosage is adjusted until the desired effect is achieved.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored at a temperature of between 15° and 25°C without direct sunlight.
Please apologize, but the chair will be sold as a collectible.
How can a bus seat break after nine months?

Statement of a municipal worker in opposition to the settlement
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
At our property, a walnut tree will be planted.
So, a complaint to the commune.
An employee writes to me that the condition of the fruit trees and the hedge banks is not part of the assessment.
In the assessment, however, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a vulnerable species.
Can I now leave the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
However, the verdict is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for this.
I have no news
Naja, then I still have a sofo without use.
Can you offer me a certificate or a voucher?
Why were they so expensive?
Yes, I think only the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the roof shipped to Germany
Can you check this?
Eilmeldung: Severe traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St. 2179 between the Selb North connection point and Plößberg.
As the police press alert currently reports (14:03), a car crashed into the oncoming traffic.
There are injured.
Ah, okay.
Well, thank goodness it went so easily!
Rat and ideas to further professional life
Just in time for Christmas!
My Christmas is unfortunately rather good, because my favourite head is currently covering everything that can be covered.
Before I left... short: I need advice and preferably from people who know my situation - that is, from you.
I am currently doing the Ref as a volunteer.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked in an area (at least a little anonymously, I call it nothing precise).
The whole thing was then too long and I had to resort to alternatives that could give me more fun.
At some point I got into the office and was sure it was - even if the framework conditions were much more rigid than in my previous job, but that was the same to me.
I am now at the third "I google other spelling".
And it is only half a year.
In the past, I always decided to continue and at least finish the rehearsals, and then I could always adjust.
But I'm absolutely finished now.
I had so little free time last month that I completely forgot.
Now it's holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
In front of the ref, I always thought I would be stress-resistant, but here my weekend was also my weekend and my birthday.
I had free.
And the stress at work was equal at the moment.
Now my own family wedding is too much stress.
And then there are these stark structures that are trying to kill me.
In principle, it is fun and, from the outside, the reflection also looks good, which is the feedback and so on.
But I'm completely drained and wonder how much stress my body is holding before it completely breaks - if it ever does.
I ask myself whether I really want to spend the rest of my working life like this - now, when I'm reading some of your contributions here -, or whether I don't actually want to go back to the old area, where I was valued, gave me free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow tedious, but it was paid for and done in a team, and not as an individual competitor, which is now the majority of the case.
But then I ask myself, will I not have returned to the same position a year ago and been unhappy?
You realize it's all somehow true, but maybe you have an outsider's view or ideas about how I came out of this situation, which I am completely finished with and almost crying about at the smallest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions right now, because I'm not feeling emotional.
But maybe your views will help me at least a little to see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas.
Thanks for reading and apologies for my bad writing.
I hope my situation has become clearer at least.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has steadily developed, which has led to the combination of the increasingly advanced modeling technology with the "valve reactor" configuration, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a speaker.
With the VT20X, VT40X and VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely at the cutting edge of sound technology.
Thanks to VET technology (virtual element technology), which is based on the analysis of the construction and switch elements, the VTX boosters are waiting for authentication, which is absolutely impressive.
Even these amps contain the most common Valvetronix pre-amplifier.
This is partly based on real analog switches, because they are much better at picking up the nuances of a speaker's voice than any simulation.
In addition to this out of phase shift, the VTX booster offers a sealed house and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only soak up.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and manipulate historical facts on the virtual stage, so that the tone and effects sound like you always intended.
The perfect combination of speaker sound and modeling technology is to be thanked for the 2001 presented VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Indeed, it has been repeatedly modified since then in order to meet the new sound requirements, which in 2010 once again led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix Series - with more dynamism and numerous and advantageous amplifier models.
From the hand-held VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists will find maximum sound diversity here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a volume enhancer: They expect a good sound, a nuanced transmission of sound dynamics and notes as well as a quick response.
During an analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the primary factor in determining the sound character of a booster is the final stage, and developed the Vox Valve Reactor technology using this information.
The valve reactor control of every VT+ amplifier is formed by the subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic's defeat series in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough for victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 against the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main face is also adjustable: with three individually adjustable lens shutter parts, it is suitable for any type of camera - from small system cameras of all sizes to full-frame mirrorless cameras.
What ultimately goes into the bag depends of course on the size of the camera and the objective.
One possible compromise would be a DSLR camera with an interchangeable lens, two to three zoom lenses, and a flash.
Large DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for further objectives.
In addition, you can still buy any amount of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the bag for his equipment and for photo-related things.
Even drone pilots will find a suitable choice in the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the bag offers plenty of storage for a DJI Mavic Pro, including a charger and accessories.
Vulkan eruption on La Palma: longest in history
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary island have caused major damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the eruption on La Palma is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
Until now, the record for the longest Atlantic crossing was held by the Vulkant Tehuya in 1585, when it took 84 days.
There are no reliable data on previous attacks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists did not make any predictions as to when it might end.
The indicators show a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island's parliament, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Millions of defects
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree-hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 residential buildings and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
About 1200 hectares were covered by a thick layer of lava.
That is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than €900 million.
In front of the coast, two new landings with a size of about 50 hectares were created by the lava.
It was particularly hard hit by the collapse of the banana industry, from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants of the island live, directly or indirectly. Many of them were already living through the crisis before the volcano erupted.
225 hectares of banana plantations have been destroyed, and other areas have been heavily contaminated, the newspaper "El País" wrote.
Christmas and the gifts
Weihnachten is standing before the door and especially the children cannot wait for the celestial festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have a somewhat magical quality, linked to the spiritual atmosphere and the tense atmosphere.
Thanksgiving is one of the few traditional holidays that still keep our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of the snitch, so that the gesture of the snitch, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnographer Marcel Mauss, was a friendly "contract of nature peoples," can be diluted and revived in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became Christ
The Protestants were particularly hard hit, as were the Christmas markets.
Previously, there had been disagreements on the Nikolaustag.
The background to this still popular site is that the holy Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, threw three women into a night of hell in his window to save their lives in Sünde.
This unconventional way of scent marking went to the heart of the matter in Germany, and above all the children with their tricks.
Protesters attacked this demand because they consider intermediaries between God and humans to be "devil worshippers."
They are protesting against the institution for these reasons.
Martin Luther made the Christ child out of the Nikolaus and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of the dispute shifts to the holy evening.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such details this way, they are only demanding that the need for Saint Nicholas' Day be as important as the need for Martin's Day with its parades and masked balls.
Today, you can find everything that the heart desires in Stiefeln, in front of the church and under the Weihnachtsbaum of Socken up to cherished luxury headphones.
Various traditions in Christian countries
According to sources, the tradition of singing at the feast of Saint Nicholas dates back to the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of the Sabbath was abolished.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a happy quack about the question of who is going to spoil the children.
In Germany, it depends on which region you are in, whether the Christ child appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who in principle is a kind of Nikolaus, to whom some properties have been assigned over time.
Among other things, this includes his white rabbit, which is only little known with the rather strict Assyrian rabbit of the historical figure, his slits, which are rented out and the preference of the kitchen to get access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, the holy Nicholas remains the central figure at the Christmas festival.

Police crack down on suspected bank robbers near the royal family
On Saturday, a police officer was shot near Kensington Palace in London.
Police said they had reported a man who had gone to a bank with a gun and the store of a bookstore.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was later stopped by officials.
There were shots fired and the man was hit.
He was still declared dead at the scene.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
Several messages have been sent in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Even other members of the royal family live there.
Which one?
No matter where I click, I will be immediately redirected to your side.
The decorative lighting adds harmoniously to every part of the garden, the vegetable area or the flower beds.
The light is simply turned on and can be adjusted with two ground screws.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Max. 10 hours of light
The robust fuel supply is available all year round in the surrounding area.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly dangerous objects from distant galaxies that are brightening up.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: Only the sun is to blame for this fascinating light emission—alternately in white or colored light (in a total of six different color temperatures).
The sculptural, amorphous design is deliberately vague: This modern light object is deliberately presented as if it were a natural formation.
Its organic rotations pass in every natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the grass or in the hedge bank.
He is also doing well in neighboring countries, where he is known for his greatness.
You can save a lot of time: As a solar light, »Smart Stone« does not require any wiring or batteries.
Put the "lightning rod" in a popular, sunny spot.
Two fired rocks are sufficient for fixing a halt.
The silky fabric itself is robust and waterproof.
Its solar module is discreetly embedded in its inner wall, together with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for red light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the house.
With intermittent lighting, the "Smart Stone" starts to glow; which color you determine yourself: There are exactly six attractive light colors to choose from - besides day and night light.
Even switching off happens automatically once the battery voltage falls to a preset minimum or if it gets hot again.
As soon as the sun appears again, the caterpillar begins to move.
I've already done it several times, but it doesn't work.
Shame, I wanted to continue to order from you, but if I don't get the coupon, I'll not be ordering from you anymore.
If you think differently, then give me a call.
Otherwise, this would have been the last contact.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
In the lockdown, there has also been no opening of a tree market...
The sound of the LokSound 5 was once again improved.
An adjustable PWM frequency of 10 kHz to 50 kHz currently ensures a super silent operation of screw conveyors – the typical "rumble" is from the past.
The last rule can now be adjusted with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "autotune" function allows the decoder to be automatically entered into the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder also delivers enough power for older motors with up to 1.5 A.

Pill problem
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I hope I do everything right, after a year Reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: Five years ago, I started to take the pill again, mainly because I was so miserable during the period and didn't have PMS before the period.
I would like to keep this, because I have to take a lot of medication for chronic diseases that I can't try.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had just under two hours to get from 0 to 100, and I did it all.
As far as I can tell, but I didn't really feel it.
In the past two years, the situation has never really normalized.
Perhaps there are some tips to avoid this.
Free of perfume and without scent is my cosmetics, but perhaps someone can recommend something.
The gynecologist did not take me seriously and the oncologist is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the book!
Yes, the love of the skin is such a thing.
Hats off to pioneering bad neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then giant scaly patches and the acne issue.
I also tried to eat while I was sick with cholera and was stuck to my porridge, milk and fishcakes because nothing else worked.
It can also be good that hormones are simply the cause, but if you want to go around building sites looking for anything else, you might as well not look.
I had already attended all of her seminars.
I wrote it and now I have lost the conversation and I don't know what was answered to my question.
I have to work in between and suddenly everything was gone...
If the money were there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong
But it is generally large
It is already available in black

110 kV electricity cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the transfer of the new high-voltage line at Tann is legally robust.
The government of Lower Saxony has approved the construction plan, which should begin in 2022.
This was now reported by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer long earth cable connects the Tann power plant in the north of the commune with the existing 110-kilovolt power line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is attached to a mast near the town of Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts with us.
The blue telephone number: #PRS_ORG# with the sending number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the remark "Position not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a decision can be made definitively.
Can you tell me how the further procedure is now?
Great start in the week!

Ref: Teaching plans (EK)
Hello colleagues and colleagues,
I have been at the Ref for the summer, and teaching has been fun, but I am currently having a lot of trouble planning my studies in environmental science.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped technically, so I can only use the board, the book and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy s/w free of charge (which is expensive).
I just need a lot of time right now to plan my hours.
We are currently addressing the issue of geofactors, and I am actually addressing it every single hour.
In principle, the methods are always the same, but I do not want to invest too much time in simple teaching hours (which I also need for UBs).
I actually always plan from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then review how I can build it (usually I just make a sheet of paper with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the assignments in the book, I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore, also the labor boards.
Maybe one day I will be able to work as efficiently with the book as a fieldworker.
I would really enjoy it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
In fact, I have already decided on #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to take the return as soon as possible.
The deal is threatened because of the 2G regulation.
In most shops, only those who have been arrested or convicted can be seen.
The retailer considers this unnecessary and complains about infringement of copyright.
He also suggested a possible solution.
The 2G regulations, from the perspective of the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), threaten the important Christmas trade.
HDE head office manager Stefan Genth criticised shopkeepers for selling items that were not needed.
According to a recent survey by the HDE, more than 70 percent of the companies surveyed looked negatively on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas shop.
What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is often a hole without a bottom, Genth said.
In the past week, dealers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their initial margin deposits.
It is only in live animal trade and online trade that this is a problem.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe situation, said the head of operations.
He stressed that “2G does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic”.
The current regulations frightened customers and required high personnel costs.
He demanded that the ban be lifted nationwide.
After that, each customer would have to be checked only once for 2G (licensed or unlicensed) and would have to be denied access to all shops that day.
In addition, in individual trade - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (ticketed, searched or tested) - samples should be sufficient.
Even the specialist real estate company Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas.
The frequencies lay at last at about 75 percent of the pre-crisis level, and about 90 percent of the pre-crisis level.
These figures are now certain to fall in the middle of the so important Christmas shopping season," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Because of the high personal and administrative burden, the Center is trying to find solutions and approved them.
This includes the so-called bankruptcy solution, in which "visitors to a central location, such as a plaza in the middle of the city, can once again obtain their 2G phone number and then - equipped with a wristband similar to that of a club hotel - enter all the shops they can". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The Spiegel has a cracker and, in addition, there is a fault in the casing, which was attempted to be plugged with the same filling material.
That looks beautiful.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed and put it back in the box.
What should I do for the return?
The lamp is based on new, thin SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
Modern microprocessors are used to set the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and natural light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash storage.
One special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to use.
The light produces a very bright beam of high quality, completely free of glitter.
The 120-degree beam is remarkable in that you can see a large area at relatively close range.
Also, in small rooms or briefings.
They can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on the set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the remote control of the lights in television studios or when the lights are mounted in inaccessible places.
The control panel on the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a light display.
The display shows the current brightness in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for the NP-F battery (not included in the delivery)
Storage The storage has up to three panels for brightness and color temperature.
To adjust the settings of the individual settings on the storage plates, simply press and hold one of the storage buttons for a longer period of time and complete the process.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when the power is turned off, so that when the power is turned back on, the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example if the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with a battery adds one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 The DL3120 can also be used without a battery.
They often already have photographers and cameramen (and women) - so that you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also be checked before the set-up whether the batteries have the necessary performance - it is a battery tester with built-in - for each of the two battery display values (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, of course, it is possible to continuously supply the light source with electricity.
The construction of the screen is very simple.
They have a 16mm screw as an attachment so that you can attach it directly to your camera.
The inclination can be accurately measured with a level on both sides.
It was also taken into account that the mechanical components are extremely sophisticated, and that they are therefore also liable to failure and heavy use.
In addition, there is a shortage of delivery capacity.
Grossartig is that a bag is also included in the quantity.
This way, you can safely transport or store the lights without problems.
Shame, I forgot to get it and it's too small: (
We wanted to humiliate the party": Frankfurt celebrates comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction by Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the two-time defending champion Hessen were seemingly on their way to the next Bundesliga match.
But then the SGE turned the tables on themselves, scoring within a good hour through a mature season start by the Seele and winning 5-2. "It is amazing what the boys have achieved today," said coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and spoke of a "season lob, one for every player who was involved".
At first, it looked like a rematch for the Frankfurters, who are now ranked ninth after their expectations.
Patrick Schick led the Leverkusen team with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
As the players have come back and shown such great performance," said Glasner.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on his feet for the first time since the fourth game day and his broken muscle, emphasized the morale of his team mates.
I think our mentality is incredible, said the 27-year-old and was particularly pleased with the result for viewers.
That was the party we wanted to smite today.
However, Glasner now wants to focus on the tasks ahead, and sees good prospects for addressing the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we all got fit in December, that all the players are physically in a top condition.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professional lives.
Now one wants to "move forward step by step and be humble" and complete the tasks by the change of the year at this level.
The next match is already on Wednesday, during the English week, at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 pm, Sky) on the program.
I get the mail back to you because of a mistake on my side.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and hang up, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and the order is renewed?
I would have to say no because it has already been too long.
Have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# stage?
Women's Handball team faces Spain in the quarter finals
After defeating Denmark, Germany's women's handball team clinked their fists and looked bored.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB team selection was defeated by 813 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face Spain in the quarter finals.
We were too timid and had too much respect for the opponent, said national coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished second behind Denmark with 8-2 points (10-0).
It is shame that we cannot take the flow.
That was one of the worst games we have to date, captain Emily Bölk said.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, they will have to step up a gear on Tuesday, when they face the World Championship second-place finisher from 2019.
The best German shooter in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Alina Grijseels with six targets.
We were simply not there—not in the attack, nor in the defense,” said Xenia Smits, a backroom player, and demanded, “We need to look ahead now”.
Not up to the height
The German team was not as strong as in the previous five tournaments.
The lack of sharpness and technical errors in attack and defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at work temperature and prevented Schlimmer with a few parades.
The first goal came after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels made a successful counter-attack.
However, this was not the case.
The German women were hardly in the picture against the aggressive Danish defense - and when they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game ended 3:10 into the second half, when the goalkeeper Mia Zschocke had to be treated for a hard foul on her opposite number.
In the quarterfinal, however, she will have to work hard again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come into its own a little bit and by the end of the first half it had already scored five goals.
Even after seven minutes of play, Hoffmann's only hope of a goal came at 9:19.
Once more, the Green Party activists slandered their opponents in all areas and made it easy for the good guy, who is counting down to the medalists.
In the following, the German team could no longer rely on a performance boost and went as a clear loser from the park.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions at Christmas time
As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we took down the Christmas tree and used it as an excuse to start our family traditions around Christmas time, Advent, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day.
How was that at home?
How about your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the best for the children?
The step ladder?
Climbing?
Shrub species?
Is it muscled?
Is the Weihnachtsmann, the Christkind, or is it just a coincidence?
As it is, everyone helps each other and around Christmas they try their best to act like a family.
Whether these are traditional customs, or even something else every year: tell us how it happened in your family!
Could you please send me a transaction number?
Transmission confirmation... etc
I would like to get a good code
so as with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Does it work for them?
The title says it all, I am an emergency physician in mobile teams where (so far) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is being stored in freezers.
As these are soon going to be finished for a large part, I will continue to go to the vaccination centres.
I would be happy to answer questions about the organisational and human aspects as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personal questions (e.g. "I take medication X, is that against the advice of the doctor?").
In my area of responsibility, the declaration for the vaccination, the indication for the vaccination (the person has a claim for a vaccination against coronavirus and no reasons why they should not be vaccinated), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency supply for allergic reactions (I have never experienced this).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, for example medical specialists.
In practice teams, however, we often do not have the time, but only (to please God!) pharmacist technical assistants for preparing the injection, which cannot give injections (can?), so I also have to perform most of the injections myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, borrowed from an Amberger, the BR television programme "We're in Bayern" has caused heated debate.
But unlike many previous days, the term remained in the series "host me?" this time without being able to guess.
No, it was not a "man who is nervous".
And no one, "who has to go everywhere quickly."
That, people heard the TV presenter say, was completely wrong.
Where did the man from Amberg get the idea for the solution and how did he possibly come up with it?
The viewer is told that "the trickster" is a rabbit with the mouth of a fox.
For years, dialect researcher Antony Rowley, from the Bavarian TV station, has been questioning this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate word, somehow related to the more well-known word "hedgehogs".
Where a gap in education had closed - perhaps even in some of those who have lived in Amberg for a long time.
I can't buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, there is always the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# with the PC synchronised and repaired.
Nothing has helped.
Reifenwahl beim Rennrad - really so secure?
Today morning I was really excited to get up because I wanted to train a little for my bike tour in the coming weeks.
Said, done, and I went with my running shoes, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40 kilometers were also really nice - but then something happened that was sweeping through every inner city (this time, thanks to Krefeld!)
Glass breaker on the street.
Zack, the loudmouth and my back-up wanted to take no chances with the rest of the stretch.
Since I had no real chance of worrying about a replacement mantel and a replacement curtain on Mondays, I had to get used to the fact that I would have to put up with the worst view and take the earliest train home.
Then it was not quite so bad technically, perhaps it is even better if I practice again with the change of speed.
But now I am facing a question and I hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long stretch of several days ahead of me, I would get extremely bored of this problem.
Now we are not really bad, because the old owner (a very old man, who had ridden his bicycle out of his yard by 2 p.m. on the day I got out of my job!) also considered this to be suboptimal, because he has been riding his bicycle on and off for years.
However, if I think that I still have to change gears at 80 to 90 kilometers per hour when driving, then I really look bad: D
Now I have come across an old man at the train station who was asking me why I didn't run the marathon plus; it should be flat.
Now it sounds very natural.
But are these really so unbreakable?
I don't want to give up 40 euros/month just to be disappointed.
Further, I ask myself: I believe I am currently 25x622.
There is also (apparently) in the Marathon Plus, but most of it is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend me to other people?
The Schwalbe side seems to me absolute! Should I recommend Durano DD?
Thanks again for the help and love!
Car crashes against tree: Driver fatally injured

After the publication of our new high-end broadcaster B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would also become a success.
SOLO 15 is the new sprinter and recalls optically the large predecessors with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this architectural plan, a suitable design foot is directly incorporated to move the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted to the length of the room accordingly.
The SOLO 15 is very good for people for whom the maximum sound level plays a rather subordinate role, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound.
It is simply not possible for a 10 cm speaker to generate such great sound pressure.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
In fact, she is remarkably mature for her age and extremely detailed and accurate about her size.
Tonal was voted the SOLO 15 with a slight high tone.
This is common practice for broadband providers to optimize their networks for the high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is precisely aimed at the listening position with very clear and powerful sound.
The high ceiling area can be reduced and the sound image can be warmer.
Thanks to the reverberation source, the positioning of the individual components of a musical piece in optimal stereo depth can be heard clearly and vividly.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 Ohm result in a dynamic that is similar to its own.
The SOLO 15 does not only expand our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of storage and accuracy.
At all our construction sites, we recommend that you start thinking about the speaker's final optical effect at the beginning, so that you can plan accordingly for changes during construction.
If you want to furnish the rooms, you must adjust the volume of the speaker accordingly, as the speaker is still loading material.
After all the records had been cut (e.g. in a record shop), one would first have to pry open a 8 mm socket on the floorboard at the corresponding point in order to then easily pass the cable through.
With the help of an overhead line, the speaker opening in the front can now be followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
The opening should be offset with a 45° phase so that the opening area of the loudspeaker cabinet is as large as possible.
The four points of contact between the B 100 and the 6 ohms are interrupted in the phase, as can be seen in the "Detail Phase" image.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a single plane in front of you.
The roof, the ceiling, and the walls are now closed.
The three deaths were also to be used and buried.
The thickness of the veneer can also be adjusted to the requirements, if, for example, one wishes to take advantage of complete sheets from the parquet market instead of cutting them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side will be brought in.
Then all the vinyl comes off, so the two sides and the front.
By means of a suitable chain lock or a tree branch, the opening of the bass reflex port and the connection plug on the back wall can be easily secured.
Then you use a circular saw to cut all the corners of the actual box.
Even the edge of the plate can be bent.
The floor plate is then attached to the floor of the house with long nails and screws.
It follows the notation and incantation (2.5-mm screws) of the points of fixation of the loudspeaker and the connecting pieces.
After the house of wood was dismantled (cut up / pulled apart), the next step is to move the cab.
This is achieved by the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
This involves pulling the entire and unshielded cable through the 8 mm bore in the floor until the opening of the terminal and leaving it there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the house, the cable leads to the speaker opening and can also be hung there.
Next, the frequency is prepared and used.
The frequency plan and the corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document: Montageanleitung Weiche Solo 15
If the frequency is built up and the termination is covered, the 8 mm cable entry in the inner part of the box is still not completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little help, you can push the shutter open and close.
By opening the B100-6 Ohm and with a small lamp, you can check the resistance accordingly.
Now follows the description of the attack.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is closed and the corresponding screws are tightened.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive lead (marked cable) must be connected to the positive pole of the speaker (larger contact).
At the end, the bass reflex tube is cut to the desired length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and sealed.
To combat this, a mat of the antifreeze material is cut into two parts and evenly distributed in the house.
The opening of the bass reflex channel should be stopped.
Can I submit an order now and only deliver it at the beginning of June?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will also be holding the OSCAST this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible to get more than four people in the studio for well-known reasons, which increases the planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
ABER: At least three people will be present per screen, so that we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 points in the stream and hopefully with thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - so we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It is about 0:30.
He serves drinks hot, plans a good meal, and makes you ready for a long, but very interesting night.
