Student sing the lead in science conference in Zhejiang University Students sing the lead in science conference in Zhejiang University
To wash your hands with air, judge the disease by hissing, and precisely search for the source of fog and smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year of Zhejiang University, a series of brilliant scientific achievements were honored.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. The research covers a wide range of fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical, life science and humanities education. Students started from a curious idea and created a number of high-end inventions with application value, some of which have been awarded in domestic and international competitions.
Biological sensors: Your family doctor
Zhang Diqiang, a doctoral student at the School of Biological and Medical Engineering, demonstrated a biological sensor on the mobile phone side, which was only half the size of a smartphone.
You just need to breathe gently and the instrument can detect your health status from the gas composition you exhale."
Zhang Diqiang said that this sensor is connected to the smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the smartphone when the user exhales gas.
The smart wristband that can be tested for health is generally tested for physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensors uses graphene, a new material, which has a keen sense of smell, making it more sensitive and accurate to show the health condition.
Intelligent surgical light: Doctor's high energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, a smart surgical light was also used in the operating room.
The invention won the silver medal at the 44th Geneva International發明展 this year.
The Ph.D. students Zhu Linping and Sun Junfei team of the Light Science and Engineering College opened a new idea in the defect of traditional surgical light and invented an intelligent LED surgical shadow light.
"Many diseases cannot be detected and removed at an early stage, and this is related to the light in the operating room of the doctor."
Song Junfei said that, for example, in the early detection of cancer, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cell will spread.
This intelligent surgical light has four light plates, through adjusting the spectrum to enhance the difference between different organizations under the light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and invisibility of the beam at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical light has been tested in the affiliated邵逸夫医院 and affiliated children's hospital of Zhejiang University Medical School and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the National Challenge Cup First Prize.
To wash your hands with air: save water and cool
To wash your hands with water is the most common way, but you can only use a little soap and a little hand sanitizer, while some of your classmates have invented a "airhand sanitizer".
Our weight can be compressed out of the air if we stand on the device's towel.
Like a gas tank.
The compressed air is formed into a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
So we can wash our hands! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiment proved that: the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of washing hands by the ordinary method.
This device can only rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure the cleanliness and save 91% of the water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention was outstanding in many top universities in the world and won the only gold medal.

This is a very meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of my other important skills, apart from my driving licence.
普及一下： the emergency response is actually the emergency response during the incident, that is, the rescue before the arrival of the ambulance.
It is well known that the ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident after a certain period of time, and this period of time is the most critical.
At this time, it is necessary for emergency treatment.
If I really have a heart attack, stroke, and sudden death, the window of my life is only four minutes. The golden four minutes!
So the people around you know how important it is to know how to take care of yourself!
When someone falls down in front of us, we can use professional knowledge to rescue them, not just stand there and do nothing, which is so scary.
In China, we have 300 million accidental deaths every year. The most dangerous is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, it is 15%.
In Las Vegas casinos, 80% can be saved, Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%."
This is the first reaction founder Lu Lei said.
If a person has a heart arrest, breathing has stopped, and heartbeat has stopped, it is no use to squeeze the middle finger.
It is necessary to perform artificial breathing and chest compressions to save the person.
I found that there are very few people now who have the consciousness to learn emergency response, but when the situation happens, it is too late, so I call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can react to emergencies in time.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
You can register at the local Red Cross training center in your area. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuzhou. Students also have discounts.
PS:The last picture is a record of the goals that I had to complete before my 25th birthday, and the addition of the emergency permit to the target list was a few months ago, but it was actually completed!
Then I will go to take other certificates that I want to take. I want to take a diving certificate. I saw a diving rescue certificate on the red book. I think it is necessary to have a diving rescue certificate to take the certificate. So the diving rescue certificate is very useful!

First of all, I would like to say the conclusion. I personally think that the film "Three Kingdoms" is a complete waste of time. It is from all angles.
But if you say that the film is not a highlight, then it is not. At least the music selection is good.
There are many kinds of bad films, one of which is to make you fall asleep in the cinema, one of which is to make you angry after you have watched it, and the film "The Four Kingdoms" is like a monkey on the mountain of Shaolin. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience, Kangxi really has a genius.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in the style of the K系 novel, difficult to describe, and with many holes like a coat of arms on the back of a horse.
Even after you have watched it, you will doubt whether there is a hidden metaphor hidden in it, but when you think about it, it turns out to be just a piece of shit.
First of all, I am very difficult to understand some scenes.
The man's hometown should be on a small island in the south of the country, where his grandmother lives.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, so the scene was arranged for a big old man to drive a small面包 car to take her to the North to see the snow.
Old people sit on a truck from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his father are very satisfied with this.
Then the old man disappeared.
How did the owner of the abandoned ship get the certificate of operation?
Why did the gang of bikers on the island do it so easily?
Then a truck delivering steel to the middle of the road stopped at the roadside, and the truck driver could not be found around it.
This effect is too obvious.
Why did a small criminal who had no credit and was suspected of breaking the law become a police officer?
Why don't you call the police when you get a high interest loan? The police even asked if there was a problem in the movie.
Does an adult know how to use a smart phone, but doesn't know how to use the key card at the hotel to open the door, and then forcefully arrange to sleep in the room outside the hotel?
This inexplicable situation filled the whole film, because the plot was so ridiculous that I would feel pain when I recalled them.
In addition to the plot, the film's main point is even worse, that is, the film has no main point, which is a hideous stitching monster.
At the beginning of the film, you think he wants to make a comedy. After 20 minutes, you think it may be an inspiring film. At the halfway point, you think it may be a drama about the survival of the small town youth. After watching it, you don't know what you have just seen at all. Then comes a deep suspicion of yourself. Why did you go to the cinema to watch the fart?
For most people, it is quite familiar with various movie tricks, for example, if you want to shoot a motorcycle driver, you have to be inspired + comedy and tell the audience a talented rookie how to achieve success one step at a time.
If you want to shoot a love film, you should tell the truth about the rivalry between the young town youth and the maid girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot should not present anything that contradicts the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that was recently burned, and then could sing a role that even Kennedy could not resist) cannot go out and do some crazy ideas that even Kennedy could not resist.
As for the main character, who is clearly not mentally handicapped, but seems to act like a five-year-old child in certain aspects, I wonder if this is the reason for the performance or the director's requirements.
And there is one more thing that I don't understand, why did Kangxi Li so passionate about adding a crash scene in his own movie?
Such a film arrangement is in the Spring Festival, is it for the audience to be inconvenienced?

South African doctor: Omikran's spread is strong but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new variant of COVID-19 are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although the speed of transmission is faster.
According to the United States news agency, as the variant of Opimic戎 spread in South Africa, a doctor's organization of more than 5,000 doctors in the town of Hodgeson, South Africa, reported that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they treat at present are relatively mild, such as body pain and coughing.
Dr Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, said that he saw dozens of patients every day, but no patients needed to be admitted.
皮莱说 ： "They can control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of being isolated. "
He said this included elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to get infected with the coronavirus.
He said that compared to the previous wave of Delta virus, the new coronavirus patients treated by him were "breathing difficult and low oxygen level."
Many people need to be hospitalized within a few days."
Two weeks after the first report of the emergence of the variant strain of Opimicin in South Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although collecting enough data takes several weeks, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Disease, only 30% of the new coronavirus patients admitted to hospital in recent weeks were seriously ill, half of the proportion of severe illnesses in the first wave of the pandemic; the average length of stay from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3% of the recent coronavirus patients died, while the death rate in the early outbreak of South Africa was 20%.
William Hanekom, head of the African Health Research Institute, cited data from the National Institute of Health and other reports as follows: "At present, almost all signs point to a mild disease."
He added: "Now it's early, we need late data.
In general, the time of hospitalization and death is later, and we entered this outbreak just two weeks ago. "
At the same time, scientists from all over the world are observing the number of cases and the hospitalization rate, while testing the effectiveness of the current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the main new coronavirus variant worldwide, outbreaks of Omikran have occurred in dozens of countries, including South Africa as the epicenter of the epidemic.
According to the health officials, the new cases found in Huntingdon in the first week of December increased by 400%, and the tests showed that the Omiyaken variant accounted for more than 90% of the cases.

Educational Commentary: What is needed to save the kidnapped children?
If the famous publicity slogan "there is no sale, there is no killing," is compared to the fact that there is no demand for "rescue" in a good environment, the prevention and control of the crime of trafficking in human beings will not be profitable, risky, and costly, and such crimes will not happen again and again.
Recently, the Child失踪信息紧急发布平台 of the Public Security Bureau of China was launched.
This is a platform for the establishment of a reliable channel for the release of missing children and the timely return of the abducted children.
I heard that the app was called "团圆", and I felt so warm.
New technologies not only have a name of "artistic" and full of emotion, but also have a proper and effective use of information technology.
The main goal of the law enforcement of the abduction is to return the abducted child and protect his personal safety and freedom.
Secondly, the trial and punishment of the suspect should be carried out.
The meaning of criminal punishment can be illustrated by many "great words".
But before the case was solved, priority should be given to the victim's personal safety.
It depends on the importance and urgency of the "search and rescue" purpose. Such controversial and disputed topics, such as whether "trafficking children should be sentenced to death", can be temporarily put aside and carefully discussed, but the rescue of the children who have been trafficked is not allowed.
According to the experience of the investigation of such cases, the traffickers are more likely to move away from the scene of the crime after getting the success.
If the search and rescue operation takes one minute longer, the child may be further away from the parent, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is a practical action to take such a direct help to solve the case and find the child.
In the end, “crimping” is a big task that needs to be done in the whole legal system.
To combat crime and safeguard the rights and interests of children and their parents, from the improvement of legislation to the guarantee of justice, and from the meticulousness of enforcement, it is not necessary to implement the care for children and the weak.
In addition, prevention of child trafficking from family to society can be done better.
For example, a common case, a family of three at the railway station resting, parents asleep, and waking up to find their child missing.
It is not possible to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have some protection awareness.
Parents can take turns resting or put their children in a safe place, which is the minimum means to prevent children being taken.
From the other side of the police crackdown on the trafficking of children, the purchase of the child should also be paid attention to and punished.
The single illegal act often only one part of a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the minimum sentence for the crime of trafficking in children is five years; if the crime is particularly serious, it can be sentenced to death and confiscated property.
The penalty point is high and the maximum penalty is heavy, so the trafficking of children is obviously a punishable crime under the trend of "light penaltyization."
There have been many cases of human trafficking to this day.
It is obvious that some people have a backward concept of raising children and a weak awareness of the law.
The education of this group should be synchronized with the education of the law.
In order to effectively control the trafficking of criminals, it is not enough to rely on the strict enforcement by the government.
If the "market" is widely available, the traffickers will be greedy, constantly innovate the trafficking methods, and form a situation with the law enforcement officers, so the trafficking action will inevitably fall into a low-efficiency muddle.
Therefore, breaking the backward mentality, spreading the legal knowledge, and also helping to cure the trafficking and buying children crimes.
Yang Hongdong preached the spirit of the Sixteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Party Congress at Ma Boxshan
From the 100-year struggle history of the party, we can take inspiration from it

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two main groups: virgin olive oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil). There are five levels.
Raw olive oil or natural olive oil is obtained directly from fresh olives by mechanical cold pressing, filtration and other processing.
According to the acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra virgin olive oil (Extra Virgin): is the highest level and quality of olive oil, is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a pleasant floral fragrance, and the acidity is not more than 1%.
Premium virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): slightly acidic, but not more than 2%, taste pure and aromatic.
Extra virgin olive oil (Extra Virgin Olive Oil): The flavor and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity is not more than 3.3%.
refined olive oil refers to the refined olive oil obtained after the refining of raw olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or become a "double oil".
The refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Normal olive oil (Olive oil): Olive oil is refined with a certain proportion of raw olive oil, so that the taste and color can be adjusted, and its acidity is less than 1.5%, which is transparent yellow gold.
Refined olive oil or pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): This is olive oil extracted from pomace by dissolving method and refined.
You should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is an important indicator.
You have to know that the olive fruit is like the grape that makes wine from different vineyards and different olive varieties, and the quality of olive oil will be different.
The best place to grow olive oil:
The Mediterranean coastline has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for growing olive trees.
In addition to the Mediterranean coast, only scattered cultivation is allowed in other areas.
Major production areas (Mediterranean Sea):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc. are similar to the climate in the far south of Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc.
The harvest month of olive oil:
Every three to six months is the time for olive trees to bloom and bear fruit, from July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, and the fruit changes from green to red, purple, and finally turns black.
November to February is the fruit harvest season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).

Oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition.
The democratic summit ended, Biden said that the fire of freedom will never stop
The online "民主峰会" (Summit for Democracy) convened by US President Biden and attended by leaders from more than 110 countries and the private sector ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom was burning in the hearts of all people around the world, and the dictatorship would never be able to put it out.
He also said that he planned to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwan government representative and member of the Legislative Yuan, Tang Fenghe, also spoke at the summit on the second day. He also spoke at the summit.
Biden said, "We know how difficult the work we face is.
But we also know that we can face challenges because I have said before that in a democratic world, there is no place for democracy.
The專制政權 cannot extinguish the flame of freedom, which is burning in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the whole society to work together.
He said: "As a leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the wall of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, and be more powerful to resist the buffer and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest."
The theme of the " democratic summit" on the second day was to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and resist authoritarianism, and counter the digital authoritarianism and affirm the democratic value.
This day falls on "Human Rights Day".
At the opening speech of the day, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Guterres, also said that the cause of democracy is facing challenges in the world, especially the challenges brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions and the resilience of democracy.
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving inequality, combating corruption, updating social contracts, investing in high-quality education, and expanding the opportunities for women.
This also requires resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including all the tools provided by the technological revolution."
Hong Kong Democratic and Human Rights Activist Ross Chien Chien delivered a keynote speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding the attendees to keep an eye on the human rights situation of Hong Kong and other Chinese minorities such as Uighur and Tibetan.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not set up a mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Li Zhenchun also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't understand (the Chinese Communist Party)'s threat to our democratic values.
And that's the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason we must change. "
At the round table discussion on "Countering Digital Dictatorship and Promoting Democracy", Taiwan's Office of the Prime Minister was chaired by Tang Feng, a member of the Legislative Yuan of Taiwan. Through a video, he released the "State Declaration", stressing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against tyranny and authoritarianism.
He also shared how he used information transparency and building trust to fight the coronavirus.
He said: "We have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the pandemic, the authoritarian governments in all parts of the world rationalized the violations of human rights for the sake of public health and collective interests. The global democracy showed signs of reversal.
However, in Taiwan, we do not need to close the city to control the epidemic, and we can defeat the fake information without removing it. "
At the same time, the U.S. Treasury announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea, and other countries that have been proven to have committed serious human rights violations, as well as investment restrictions on a Chinese company that has been proven to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

But the restaurant doesn't know why the delivery time is repeatedly delayed
It was originally #number#
So I didn't call
Not eaten
I will definitely complain
You can't get it, so why don't you tell me earlier?
Waited so long

Why not cancel
Hello, the chicken delivered by the restaurant is alive
I want to try tennis, but I am afraid I will not be able to stick to it, so I want to practice for a little bit at a similar price.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often related to the friendly degree, and if you can't distinguish, the normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap one, which is actually industrial waste.
They are very weak, and the ball hits the pad, and the vibration is very large. The hard ball can't hold it, and the masters can't handle it.
Their logical and tactical existence is: -Tennis is so difficult, know that you can't learn it, and know that you can't afford to buy expensive, make a cheap product to fool you, you play twice, you won't play again, so the racket is cheap, and you don't have to worry.
When you really can distinguish the good from the bad, it means that you have progressed. When you come here to buy the expensive, I will make two money.
It is recommended to buy a second-hand good quality racket at a similar price, and choose Prince or Dunlop. The two brands are not so famous, so the price of a good racket is not high, so a new racket of 500 and 600 is enough, and a second-hand 200 yuan is enough to enjoy the pleasure of a thousand yuan racket?
It is quite friendly to newbies, but after the beginner stage, it becomes useless. However, most people, especially women, cannot pass the beginner stage.
Orders have been repeatedly delayed in delivery time
Can you help me follow up?

In fact, there are many requirements for girls with a small body.
Girls who are fat in their bodies should wear skirts that are not too short or too long. The length should be about the knees, covering the fat areas of their legs.
If the skirt is too short, it will show the fat on the legs.
If it is too long, it will make you look small and fat.
If you wear out the upper, middle and lower sections, it will appear that you naturally grow taller, that is, that the upper body, skirt and hose skirt are made of different colors, which will give you a slender feeling.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for thin girls (this is what the author has experienced). Dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat, and elegant black skirts are the first choice for thin girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially black skirts, will make you look thinner.
If your leg is very fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too much.
It should be more popular, and the color should not be too bright.
So that people don't pay attention to your legs and feet when you get fat.
For a little bit fat girl, it is important to know how to wear clothes.
It is not advisable for a thin girl to wear a tight skirt, and the upper garment should not be too short or stuck in the skirt. This will make the girl look uncomfortable. If the girl is fat, she should wear black leggings or grid leggings (the kind with fine stripes), and choose a soft print tulle skirt with a low neckline, which will make the girl look more slender.
Of course, a thin girl is also required to wear a skirt.
The fat girl wears a skirt, so she should choose the skirt color that matches the skirt. This will make your fat body look taller.
Short skirts paired with heels can make your legs appear longer, which is the most IN summer outfit!
If you are overweight on the upper body but thin on the legs, you can choose a glamorous evening dress.
Not only can it hide your belly, but also show your advantages.
Short skirt will make you look slimmer, and it is suitable for girls who are fat. The shirt should be tight, so that the layers will make you look slimmer.
Simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt can be tried by everyone.
The slim girl can also wear fashion.
If you can master the rules of clothing combination, then thin girls will also be the focus of attention.
After making changes to the way of dressing, we should also exercise more in our daily life and try to leave the label of petite girl as early as possible.😄

Xinhua News Agency - Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League Boosts Winter Olympics Hopes - Xinhua
On the 11th of December, Beijing Dreaming team player Qi Yuansheng (center) kicked the ball in the game.

Girl donates to her sister as a target for her brother: "I thought it would be better if it was flesh wounds," - Xinhua
An 11-year-old girl stood in front of a big wooden board and wrote on the board "people's flesh targets, one yuan for a shot".
Yesterday morning, a photo of a girl from Hangzhou volunteering as an "arrow target" to raise money for her sister went viral on the朋友圈.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a big wooden board that is slightly taller than people. On the board, written in Chinese, are the words "people's flesh targets, 10 yuan for one arrow". This means that after paying the fee, the person can shoot the arrow.
The behavior triggered a lot of discussion on the Internet.
Last night, the publicity person in charge of the sub-district office of Hangzhou Municipal Police Department confirmed to the reporter of Xinhua News Agency that the police had confirmed that the girl was indeed a sister in need of donations, but such behavior was not worthy of encouragement. After being warned, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
Girl arrested for street "arrow target" fundraiser
The picture on the Internet shows a long-haired girl standing in front of a large wooden board with the word "people" written in black ink on it. On the other side of the wooden board, there is a bank account number and a WeChat and Alipay account number written.
The picture was controversial after it went online.
Some netizens believed that this was a "ballistic begging behavior", and many netizens expressed sympathy for this.
We found the situation when we patrolled the square at about 10 a.m. on the 23rd. The spectators were already numerous.
At the scene of the incident, a police officer at the Qixia police station said in an interview with local media that there were two girls who were selling clothes, both of whom were 20 years old and looked young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who was making a "people's target" was crying and begging the people to play the game; the other girl was helping to yell at the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and needed to have the operation, so please help.
We contacted the local police in貴州 and learned that the girl was donating blood for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the person in charge of the Propaganda Department of the杭州市公安局下城分局 told the reporter of Xinhua News Agency that the girl was named Jijia Li. She was raising money for her sister Jijia Xian.
However, because treatment still requires more than 30,000 costs, it was not possible to think of a good way to raise funds at the moment.
He said that during the whole process, the two girls were the targets and the one who was responsible for taking the lead, but they were not involved in the whole process, and no one shot a bow and arrow during the whole process.
After the police verified the use of the bow and arrow by the security department, it was not in the scope of control.
The person in charge said that "it is not advisable to adopt such eye-catching fundraising method."
After being warned by the police, she has left the police station.
Thermal performance: good. Lightness: convenient. Outer material: satisfied. Acer has always been very competitive.
The new machine is very good.
The performance is stable, the four outflow vents are not affected, and it is recommended.
This HP's Shadow Knight Dragon gaming laptop is quite good in terms of workmanship and materials, and it is a trusted brand!
The price of the Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is not too expensive.
Personally, I think that the Chromebook Shadow Knight Dragon is really good. The game effect: The game effect is smooth, and you can play most games comfortably. My game of deathmatch is stable at a high frame rate, and it is very smooth. Lol is no exception. CSgo is also easy to play. Most three-a game can be played.
Cooling: The cooling effect is quite good, the fan is quite strong, and the working noise is quite quiet, so the fan is quite big.
The exterior material: The exterior is quite cool and stylish. The display effect: The screen is quite clear, and 1080p is enough for playing games.
I really like the idea of buying a notebook, mainly for design. It is very affordable and has a high quality. It is lighter than expected and looks better than expected. The red on the butt is a beautiful wine color. It is not too vulgar. It is much higher than expected. It is worth buying. It is also suitable for women.
I started to contact the Dark Knight Knight 2 years ago. After 2 years, it is more affordable and of better quality.
My friends also recommended me to buy this product!
Currently, you have already purchased this series of 3 machines!
The exterior is beautiful and looks good.
I bought it for my nephew. I wanted to wait for the bank's activity on April 18, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it before the bank's big activity, which was a bit disappointing.
However, the price is quite high, the logistics is quite fast, and I will come back to review it in a while.
This is a brand-new and high-performance game laptop computer with a stylish design. It has been installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.

He said it was good for his son.
The computer is quite good, especially the customer service is quite good, and if you don't know, just ask, and recommend to buy.
Not bad, the graphics of the game are really good
What is the most popular in 2021?
Of course, Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, there was a very popular article titled "Quick Look! Project Manager Can Impact the Olympic Games!" In it, it was mentioned that project managers are absolutely able to take the lead in many projects, and no one else can do it: The daily routine of the project manager is to move bricks, go out of town, and go to bed late. The daily routine of the project manager is to save fires, bear the blame, and apologize.
It seems a joke, but it also reveals the daily hardship of the project managers, which represents the incapability of the current project management work.
And those who work in project management are gradually choosing to take some actions to get rid of the difficulties in their work.
From the increasing number of PMP (International Certified Project Management Professionals) candidates each year, more and more project management professionals are learning to improve their project management capabilities through study.
According to the "20-Year Development Report on China's Project Management (1999-2019)", by the end of September 2019, the total number of PMP® candidates in China had reached nearly 60 million, the number of PMP® certified candidates had reached about 42 million, the number of effective certified candidates had reached about 30 million, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certified candidates in the world.
The number of PMP-certified personnel has been increasing every year for the past 10 years, which shows that more and more project managers realize that the simple copying of the "old experience" is no longer acceptable. The瞬息万变的 working environment makes us know that we should learn to explore the way forward on the shoulders of scientists.
But can a PMP certification guarantee smooth project management?
Many project management beginners say that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten areas and five process groups of project management, but when they actually do project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following questions: The project management cognition is not adequate, the project management is purely based on personal experience, the project management theory is not known how to practice; the lack of a systematic project management process system support, the work cannot be put into practice, the project estimate is not accurate, the control is not sensitive, the project is dragged and pulled; the member division is not clear, the "old oil" in the team does not know how to deal with the cross department assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, more than ten years of focus on product innovation and R&D management has helped many excellent enterprises to train a large number of product managers, project managers and other R&D key talents, and won the honorary title of "China's R&D Management Training Demonstration Base".
The online course of "Developing Project Manager Training Camp" This is an online fragmented learning method that combines numerous practical case studies, tools and methods of research and development enterprises, helping you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of a project manager and take your own project management to the next level.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less investment to promote the training process of project managers and bring more efficient operation results for enterprises.
Without any evidence, you can first see how other students evaluate the course: This course not only is explained by experts from China Telecom Hong Kong (formerly Huawei R&D Management Team), but also combines international advanced project management methods with real business scenes from well-known enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, and help students convert the learning content into specific work after class.

Jiaxing urged consumers to be rational before the "12th" - Economic Observer Network - professional financial news website
The transaction amount of the national online payment business during this year's "11. 11" celebration festival reached RMB157 billion, which was a new high compared with the previous year.
With a variety of colorful discount coupons and eye-catching live shopping, the consumption fever once again made consumers feel the benefits. On the one hand, it made people feel that the national consumption power was stronger and stronger. On the other hand, it had to think about the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream contemporary consumption group.
At the eve of the "12th National Day", Ji Xiaozhong Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Ji Xiaozhong Finance") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding all users, especially young people, to set up a good consumer consciousness and consumer habits, and refuse to be blind to consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 from 2019.
Overall, the performance of China's residents in the financial consumption level is better, but there are significant differences in the aspects of financial behavior and skills, and further improvement in the basic financial knowledge level is needed.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and the “one old and one young” will still be the focus of continuous attention in financial education; the “China Youth Debt Situation Report” released by Nielsen and the “2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report” released by CCTV Finance show that the young generation has huge consumption potential, credit consumption has become an important way of consumption upgrading, and 86.6% of the young people are using credit products. Nearly half of the young people do not have accumulated debts, although the overall trend of rational consumption is shown, it is quite different from the “over-consumption” label attached to the outside world, but some young people do exist over-consumption, following consumption behavior, and thus have a large financial pressure and debt risk, even leading to social problems gradually increasing, and the financial enterprises should dare to bear social responsibilities and do positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, JCB has always been committed to providing high-quality and thoughtful services to help the people build their own happy life. It advocates for consumers to set up a good and correct consumption attitude, and actively responds to the call of the regulator to improve consumer awareness, especially for young people.
In the past few years, Ji Xiaochu has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge dissemination activities for young people, including college students, through various means, such as cooperation with domestic top universities and launching innovative practice contests, and has gradually influenced the consumption demand of young people in a reasonable way, helping them to establish rational consumption concepts, reasonable planning of consumption needs, and ultimately helping them accumulate life wealth.
On the eve of the Double 12, JCB reminded all consumers friends to set up a reasonable consumption awareness and correct money觀, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid the consumption loan misunderstanding, and avoid affecting personal credit and future economic life.
It is necessary to plan in advance and do it on time.
If it is late, the late record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have adverse effects on buying cars and other economic life in the future.
At the same time, while enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose legal institutions and channels and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions are qualified to operate.
In the future, JCB will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and improved financial products to provide consumers with more in line with their needs and diverse services, continuously help the masses improve their financial knowledge level, and help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderately borrowing. It is a trusted consumer finance partner for life.

Vietnamese People's Daily - The Gulf Cooperation Council Responds to Common Challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stopover includes Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in 2017, which led to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a complete blockade on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tension seriously affected the internal cohesion of the SCO and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked access to the Middle East from the Middle East.
This crisis was only resolved at the summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council in January 2021. The Gulf Cooperation Council signed a deal with the United States and Kuwait to move towards "stability and unity".
Saudi Arabia reopened the border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors by the two countries in Qatar.
The Gulf Cooperation Council resolves differences to restore relations with Qatar from the need to unite in order to deal with common challenges.
During the visit of Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct陸路通道 between two neighboring countries in the Gulf.
The 7.5-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel and integration of citizens of the two countries.
Saudi Arabia's public investment fund (PIF) will invest 50 billion dollars in Oman, and two countries signed 13 cooperation memorandums worth 3 billion dollars.
The visit of Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to the Gulf countries coincided with the negotiations between Iran and the major countries of the world on the JCPOA, which aims to save the Iranian nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and regarded the Iranian nuclear program as a threat to regional security.
All the Gulf states believe that without solving the Iranian missile problem and taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region, it is deficient.
In the context of the failure of major countries and Iran to meet the wishes of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted direct negotiations.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of regional tension.
This is one of the factors that can slow down the economic growth of the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The Summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) will be the first summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) since some member countries and Qatar's dispute ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-assess the diplomatic achievements that contributed to the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, while proposing various measures to make its member countries fully cooperate to deal with common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

The new mountain bike is said to have the biggest exhaust sound!
This vehicle we brought for you this time is a dream for many men.
It is the Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model - Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the LP700 is nearly 200,000 yuan, the road tax is nearly 15,000 yuan a year, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Because it has 700 horses, how fast can you imagine?
So, I don't know, but the data says that the 0-100km/hr acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, which is about myvi to reach 30km/hr when the other person reaches 100km/hr.
The low-slung body, the arrogant cutaway door, the huge exhaust port all around the body, and the 6.5-litre V12 engine that can be seen through the glass below, perfectly define the style of Lamborghini.
For the description of the vehicle, you don't need to say much, just Google it yourself. Here is a list of Google may not give you the answer!
It was too much attention, and everyone was watching, so it wasn't comfortable!
The 1km oil cost is around RM1 (the owner doesn't care)
Try to practice the position of getting on and off the car, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you can't climb out of the car and then get stuck halfway)
The engine sound was too loud, and you would suddenly be deaf when you got out. (But it was still fun)
The car is too big, and it will be very narrow and very afraid of being knocked by the neighbor's car when it is parked in the ordinary parking lot!
It's a bit lonely because there are no competitors on the road (I told the owner, not related to me, hahaha)
Please don't misunderstand. The supercar in this video is not for sale. Sorry!
If you want to shoot a video for your car, please contact us!
More you don't know about cars, The Car Guide / People's Car Journal
It involved a car worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are well-known to car lovers, Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and Porsche 911's price is even higher!
Yesterday, millions of cars crashed in a matter of minutes in front of the eyes of millions of spectators in front of the eyes of millions of spectators.
See the result, it is right!
Let the university spirit and the era spirit resonate at the same frequency - Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and values that a university has accumulated over time in the development process, which is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to present, the university spirit is of utmost importance for the development of politics, economics, culture, science and technology, as well as the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the first modern university in the world, the university has been entrusted with a unique mission different from that of other social organizations, and the spirit of the university is deeply influenced by the traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocates the value concept of "dedication to the world and the cultivation of virtue" and the patriotism of "promoting education and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming more and more obvious, and the global education competition, scientific and technological competition and talent competition continue to intensify. As an important "downstream" of higher education, its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the introduction of the "Planning for the Overall Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and Excellent Disciplines" showed my country's confidence and determination to move from a large country in higher education to a strong country in higher education. At the same time, it also raised higher and more updated requirements for the development of universities.
How to accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines in the short term, accelerate the construction of a few world-class universities and a few world-class disciplines on the basis of still having a certain gap, and achieve "steep climbing"?
In addition to being confident in its firm goal, its path confidence, and its ability confidence, colleges and universities should also fully play their three advantages: first, by continuously attracting overseas outstanding academic talents, they can learn from the advanced experience of world-renowned universities, achieve a significant improvement in academic level and quality of education; second, by inheriting the wisdom of the Chinese civilization in the five thousand years of accumulation, they can promote the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to unite forces, shape brands, and enhance image; third, by playing the advantages of socialism, they can strengthen the driving force of the goal, gather consensus, optimize resource allocation, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate its catching up with the advanced level of the world.
It is especially important to realize that the construction of a world-class university cannot be the same at every school. At the same time, each school must show its personality and style.
The distinctive features of the school should have Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique target positioning and the traditional and resources of each school.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we emphasize the following three aspects in our education: first, to emphasize the development of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, to build a comprehensive integrated education environment that integrates science and education, and to form a comprehensive chain of entrepreneurship education ecosystem; second, to emphasize the cross-cutting characteristics of disciplines, to promote the optimization of the discipline system, and to create a system of cross-cutting disciplines, to actively cultivate interdisciplinary new disciplines and flagship interdisciplinary achievements; third, to emphasize the characteristics of the school system and social service, to carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and to accelerate the formation of a Zhejiang University system of industrial and academic research cooperation.
In this process, especially, it is important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Study Innovation," the common value of "勤学," the common value of "rectitude," and the common value of "opening the sea and opening the heart," together form the latest expression system of Zhejiang University's spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of education, constantly accumulate cultural height and gather the spirit strength, and has a rich connotation and profound significance.
Among them, "Hai Nanjiang" emphasizes the spirit of openness and tolerance, manifests the spirit of "utilizing all talents in the world", and shows that the high-quality concept of absorbing high-quality educational ideas from world-renowned universities; "True Deed" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and perfection, and refers to the fact that universities should not only seek truth, but also accept the cultivation of virtue and the cultivation of character in pursuit of truth. "Opening to the people" emphasizes the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the spirit of seeking new knowledge and the spirit of innovation in science and technology, and also refers to the fact that universities should not only seek truth but also accept the cultivation of virtue and the cultivation of virtue in pursuit of truth. "Building my country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, and refers to the fact that universities should always share the fate of the country with the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and values pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
The "wise listen to the silent, the bright see the invisible".
China's colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, grasp the situation of higher education in the era, and accelerate the construction into a world-class university.
At the same time, we must adhere to humanism and independence, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation be stirred, so as to provide endless energy for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation and the realization of the common ideal of humanity.

The wedding photo is so beautiful, blown up by the photographer and makeup artist, you are really superprofessional.
Thank you very much for your patience and instruction. I really like the picture you took.

U.S. Asian group complains about discrimination at three Ivy League schools - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 23 (reporter Xu Zhimei) - US colleges and universities in more than 130 Asian groups submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the US Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting the discrimination of Asian students in the enrollment process of three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Education Alliance, which led the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The head of the group, Zhao Yuhao, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the criteria for American top schools has grown by a hundred times, but in the three top American schools, the proportion of Asian applicants remains basically the same.
Many studies have shown that these universities in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" of admissions process have "long-term sustainability and systematic discrimination of Asian students."
Zhao Yuhao said that the research of Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that in these three colleges and universities, the proportion of applicants relative to the number of applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
The data from the US Department of Education also showed that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest proportion of Asian students admitted, and Yale University and Brown University had effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian students for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yuhao told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hoped that after submitting a complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice would conduct an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from discriminating against Asian students in the future.
They also expect the college to actively pay attention to this issue and change the admissions policy for Asian students.
At present, the three colleges have not responded to the complaint.
The Asian Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it complained about Harvard University's admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to the American Chinese group, the group also included American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.

On September 9, 2020, Mr. Li learned from a real estate agent that a factory building was located in Zixuan, Zhejiang Province. After visiting the building several times, Mr. Li decided to buy the building.
The same month, Mr. Li negotiated with the owner of the house, Lin, after purchasing the building details, and transferred 20,000 yuan as a deposit.
Liu signed as the payer on the receipt book of the "Factory Buying Deposit Receipt", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, and the two parties agreed to sign a contract for the purchase of the factory within a week."
However, after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on major contract terms such as the scope of the sale of the factory and the payment method, the contract for the sale of the house was not signed until late.
In view of the fact that neither party could agree on the content of the contract within a few days, Li returned the 20,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
After all the hard work, he finally got the house he wanted, and the mortgage was ready. But when he signed the contract, the seller did not sell it. This made Mr. Li frustrated and angry.
To this end, Mr. Li referred the case to the Quzhou Municipal People's Court.
The court found that the parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, and it was not reasonable to assume that the negotiation was not successful, so the case should not apply the fixed penalty. The defendant did not have to bear the double repayment of the fixed penalty.
After the verdict, the plaintiff filed a appeal.
Recently, the lower court maintained the original verdict.
Lawyer reminds: In the course of the transaction, it is necessary to perform the necessary cautious attention duty.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, you should take necessary cautious attention, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house has been occupied, etc., and clearly state the specific time and place of delivery in the contract, so as to prevent disputes between the parties during the performance of the contract.
(Xinhua) "The democratic summit" ended on Friday. On Saturday (November 11), the spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a speech that the United States held a "leadership summit for the people", which is "dividing the people with the use of ideology, militarizing the democratic tools and weaponizing the democratic tools, pretending to be democratic while doing the real thing of anti-democracy, and stirring the internal conflict."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value concepts on people, carried out 'democratic reform', imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated a 'color revolution', resulting in devastating consequences."
The 'democracy' has become a 'biggest killer weapon' for the US.
This summit is a Biden's action to fulfill his campaign promise.
The meeting was held in video form for two days and invited leaders from 111 countries, including Taiwan's leader, but China and Russia were not invited.
Before the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for having problems with its own democracy and accused the United States of not having the right to hold such a summit.
However, there are also critics in the international and domestic circles, such as those who criticize the invited leaders, including some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as leaders in the Philippines, Poland and Brazil. Some people doubt that the true intentions of the Biden government were not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
New German Prime Minister Scholz also attended the video democracy summit
The statement by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday said that "today's American democratic madness is obvious, money politics, identity politics, party rivalry, political polarization, social strife, ethnic conflict, and income inequality have become increasingly severe." The American democracy is based on capital.
In his speech, President Biden said, "As a leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the wall of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, and be more powerful to withstand the buffer and shock of authoritarianism and those who seek power before the public interest."
He stressed that democracy is not inevitable, "we must constantly update it in every generation, in my view, it is a decisive challenge in this era. "
Biden also said that the global democratic and human rights "face a continuing and worrying challenge, and the democratic need fighters to defend."
The United States has promised to launch a one-year action after the democratic summit, including a 4.244 billion-dollar initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that countries make concrete public commitments before the 2022 physical democratic summit to improve its democratic system.
Biden said, "Let us all implement our commitments and report on our progress next year."
Yes, I only fear that he has sent the wrong address.

What is the drinking method of red wine?
Everyone's hobby is different, and some people like to collect, others like to eat, and there are also people who like to drink whisky, and the red label whisky is one of the most popular scotch whiskies in the world, and the red label whisky has won the gold medal of the International Wine Competition.
Each bottle of red label whiskey has its own unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, it's not worth it.
How to drink red wine?
Here is a summary for you.
Red card whisky drinking:
The Honest Gator Red Rum is made from about 35 types of Scotch whiskey and has a rich aroma and traditional Scotch whiskey characteristics. The rich aroma contains sweetness and smoke flavor.
The entrance is sweet and fresh, with a hint of cinnamon and strong smoke flavor.
The wine can be directly added to ice, or mixed with the favorite beverage.
Red label whiskey has entered the domestic market. In order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, red label whiskey + cola or Sprite or New奇士 has become a style that has lasted for a long time.
These sweet drinks, apart from being able to neutralize the acidic taste, can also bring joy to the eyes and change the taste of the wine.
Red whiskey + slice lemon + sugar (sugar can also be substituted) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The authentic red wine flavor is slightly sour, and the addition of sugar can neutralize the acidity, and the lemon will add fresh aroma to the wine, of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to the personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink red wine whisky, and everyone can try them as a reference. I hope my introduction can help you.
Education thoughts: How to make college students and undergraduates equal in college entrance examination - Xinhua
Three students from Lanzhou University of Technology wrote to the head of the school, expressing their confusion about college entrance examination and proposing to increase the difficulty of the examination, change the format of the examination, and make the examination truly reflect the actual level of students.
In fact, for a long time, university examinations have been a "hot" topic.
At the university campus, students come from all over the country and have varying levels of ability and different degrees of learning. In addition, the learning situation is varied.
For a group with such diverse characteristics, there are different feelings. It is inevitable.
Of course, if the test question type is simple and repetitive, the question is too simple, it will inevitably cause a completely different feeling.
Students who don't work hard may be able to pass the examination before the examination, but if they try other ways, they may achieve a half-baked effect.
As a result, there would be a "poor student" who can pass the examination and even get a high score; and a "poor student" who never misses class and does a good job on all his assignments and notes; and a "poor student" who does not get a high score in the examination.
It seems that the students of Langfang University of Science and Technology reflect that the problems in college entrance examination are not without reason, and that this situation is not confined to Langfang University of Science and Technology.
From this point of view, I would like to give a thumbs up to these three students who have written letters to me.
In fact, those who have gone to college know that there are many cases where students try to "borrow" exam questions from teachers and seek "specialized guidance" before the exam, and even those who take notes during the exam and ask for teacher's favor after the exam are not unusual.
In my opinion, as a teaching quality assessment-oriented, measuring the pass rate of a university examination is more about the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning and the scientific命题 on this basis.
At the beginning of the undergraduate level, the specialty begins to be subdivided, and many specialty courses are dominated by basic knowledge.
No doubt, whether you fully master the basic knowledge points of a discipline is the content to be tested in college entrance examination.
The basic knowledge of undergraduates is basically the basic theory and basic knowledge of disciplines. From the point of view of knowledge, the change is not much, and basically is fixed.
As a teacher said, " 20 years ago, I studied the basic knowledge of college mathematics, and it is still studied today. It is still the focus."
But the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test type is single and repeated.
In many universities, the examination will usually be organized by the examination team, and the examination will be composed by the senior teacher of the discipline, and the examination will be composed by the whole teacher of the discipline, so that the repetition of the examination can be partially overcome.
However, it is necessary to prepare a set of tests that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation. The difficulty of the test is normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students, and the difficulty of the test is proportional to the overall level of learning of the students, so that the test命题 has dynamic control over difficulty and type, which can highlight the examination of the basic knowledge, and can also consider the examination of the ability. At the same time, the test should be innovative in design.
The examination is the driving force of university education. What kind of examination is there, the student will have corresponding preparation plans. Over time, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The recommendation letter for students is highly valued by the蘭州交大, and a plan for rectification has been deployed throughout the school.
It is required that all teaching units organize teachers to carry out research and class closing examination comparison and self-examination, set up the examination test and related system, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination test and examination process, and finely define the results, and strengthen the comprehensive evaluation of the course teaching in all aspects.
The problem of the single type of test and the repetition of the questions is a matter that college examinations need to face, and it is necessary to take measures to solve it, but the difficulty lies in daily practice. It is necessary for teachers to have a comprehensive understanding of teaching conditions, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the student's learning situation, both of which must be understood, so as to better connect teaching and learning and form a healthy interaction between teaching and learning, and the examination will be more in line with the reality, so that the "master of learning" and the "student" can each have their own advantages.

The wedding dress photography (South Street) has not yet opened a branch
Before taking pictures, because we didn't have enough time, we had to change the time twice. Lan Lan was patient and helped us arrange the time.
Then chose a good weekend to shoot.
The staff of the Queen’s granddaughter is excellent.
That was my first formal makeup, wow <v>I can't believe</v> I will look so good one day, hahaha.
Xia Jie and another girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) were very patient in makeup, and makeup was also natural.
The picture was taken at the Qianjiang Town. Fortunately, it was a nice day, so I didn't feel very cold, and when I took the picture, the makeup artist would occasionally check our clothes, jewelry, and did a little bit of bad.
The photographer was very funny, and he felt very happy when he took a picture every day.
When choosing photos, because I saw many cases online, I didn't want my guests to delete too many photos, but when I choose photos, really, I didn't want to add photos at all, just the 24 photos in the package (I heard that my sister in law took her wedding photos at the same time as me, and the package cost 7,000 yuan, but she didn't add any more than 10,000 photos, and I was shocked when I saw it).
Today, the picture was repaired, and Lan Lan sent it to me. I saw two pictures that I didn't like, and they immediately helped me repair them.
Comparing the photo taken by my sister before, I think our photo is really satisfactory. Simple and fresh, just what I want.
I sincerely recommend that you go to Wanshan Jin Woman to take a wedding photo!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Jin was grateful for the sincerely wishing you happiness and success. Your future is bright!

More than 3,200 newborn babies in Sabah without birth paper due to shortage of customized anti-counterfeit paper
Sabah National Registration Board said on November 11 that due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeiting paper, it was not possible to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October. The affected number has reached 3,200 so far.
However, the director of the Bureau of Registration ensured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have their information recorded in the system, and that the fake birth certificates will be issued when the counterfeit paper arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained that there had been a long-standing report on the printing of newspapers in Sarawak for more than 10 months.
He said that the problems had appeared two months ago, and Vietnam also faced the same problems.
One reason is that the Chinese manufacturer specializing in producing anti-counterfeiting paper was affected by the outbreak, which delayed the arrival of the paper in China.
He explained that the use of counterfeit paper in Sarawak's birth paper is different from that in other states, so it cannot be borrowed by other states.
Ke魯阿米努斯 revealed that the latest batch of counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on June 6 and was then delivered to the printing company on August 8 for partial printing work.
The agency will send a person to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, and return to Sabah immediately for the final stage of printing, which can be delivered to the applicant within two working days (20 December).
We will notify the applicant to go to the local分局 to receive the birth certificate. "
He added that Sarawak has issued 2,488 copies of birth certificates so far this year.
I waited till now from 7.
Is it going to be soon?
I mean food.
I waited on the opposite side of #PRS_ORG#
Okay, thank you, because the restaurant said it was ready.

Education Information: Beijing Reduces the Proportion of Special Education Students in the Early School in 2016 - Xinhua
On the 21st and 22nd days of the month, the examination work for special talents for primary school students in Beijing was coordinated by the local education departments.
This year, Beijing all districts have compressed the proportion of special students, and the competition for special students is more intense.
As an example, in the district of Dongcheng, the proportion of special enrollment for primary and secondary school students in this year is generally not more than 5% of the total number of enrollment plans in the district, and the enrollment ratio is not more than 10% of the enrollment plan of the school.
Any student who has a special talent and is registered on the Internet has the right to take part in the examination of special talent.
In order to make it convenient for students to take the examination nearby, Dongcheng District extended the examination arrangement last year and set up 1 to 2 examination locations in each school district, totaling 13 examination locations.
The examination venue is divided into examination stations according to the examination area, and the examination period is divided into hours according to the hour. The examination is carried out in the examination station of different examination areas according to the hour.
On the 23rd of May, the district education examination center online publicized the list of students who passed the examination. Students can check the examination results online.
Can it be delivered in 10 to 15 minutes?
Not received food
The key is that I haven't eaten tonight.

The 48-hour negative result of the nucleic acid test and the establishment of a "buffer zone" require the State Council to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control of the port cities. - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 11 (reporter董瑞丰、顾天成) The State Council Coordination Mechanism for Combating and Controlling the COVID-19 recently issued a Notice on Strengthening the Prevention and Control of the COVID-19 in Port cities, requiring that people who leave the land border port cities within 48 hours (excluding Hong Kong and Macau with a port connected to the land border port city) must have a negative nucleic acid test result within 48 hours, and that people who arrive at the land border port cities must have a nucleic acid test at least once after arriving.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the determination of the port city scope of the provinces and cities and the announcement on March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that coastal cities with conditions can study the establishment of a buffer zone for epidemic prevention and control within the jurisdiction.
The relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy, and the two sides of the border population exchange frequently.
Implementing a differentiated management policy for the division of the epidemic, from a one-way prevention and control barrier to two barriers, is expected to move the border forward, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and minimum social cost.
Recently, there have been several local cluster outbreaks in my country, all of which were imported from overseas.
The above notifications pointed out that this exposed some problems in timely monitoring and early warning of the epidemic in some places, the implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk employees, the routine nucleic acid testing, the lack of disinfection of cold chain items at all stages, and the management of concentration isolation facilities were not in line with scientific and precise measures.
The notice requires that from improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of the port city, strengthening the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing the border control measures, etc., to speed up the correction of the epidemic prevention and control deficiency of the port city, to be relaxed and scientifically and precisely to carry out the epidemic prevention and control work, and to strengthen the external prevention and control line.
The notice emphasizes that the cities at the ports should synchronously study and deploy the prevention and control of the epidemic at the same time, publish and open the民生保障 hotline, regularly check the early warning signs and hazards of basic living materials supply and price, and timely solve and actively respond to the prominent problems raised by the public.
According to the notice, the coastal cities mentioned include the open road, sea, air port located in the county (prefecture, prefecture-level city, prefecture-level city) and the capital city (prefecture-level city, prefecture-level city, prefecture-level city), and the specific scope will be determined by the provinces (prefectures, prefectures, prefectures, prefectures) according to the needs of the epidemic prevention and control and be timely announced.

U.S. oil pipeline video exposes the truth of 20 years of bloody killings - Xinhua
(Video source: YouTube)
On the 11th of December, a micro documentary titled "The Kill Machine" was widely discussed.
The film tells the story of the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan with the pretext of "counter-terrorism", forcing the U.S.-style democracy to be forcibly exported through the war. The U.S. has spent more than 20 years in poverty and cruelty, killing innocent people indiscriminately.
Using drones to attack hospitals and schools, distorting human nature and forming a killing group.
For 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan.
The US military has set up a "black prison" to torture and humiliate the "defendant".
A series of crimes against humanity have triggered more hatred in Afghanistan.
As the video said, the American "Counterterrorism" war "has become more and more fearsome."
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan, but it has brought only devastation and destruction.
Watch the video, let us unmask the truth of the US using the pretext of "counterterrorism" and the bloodthirsty killing, and unmask the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I accidentally saw the following article from a business perspective and from the perspective of the preservation period, why this customer wants to help the logistics company in the port area do the canning, although the canning is a deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of the port logistics company, here the text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and met many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials for both bags and bottles of infant formula are the same, no difference.
So everyone will probably ask: Why is a bag's shelf life one year, while a can's shelf life is two or more years?
Or they might ask: Why is the price difference between listening and packing?
In fact, many consumers or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the expensive is good.
Some consumers also said that the taste or smell of the food was different after eating it.
Now I would like to tell you about the reason why I wear a disguise. Where is it?
Why is the difference so large between the raw materials?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the bag price is too high, consumers will not be able to accept it, which means that the manufacturer's profit is low, or that there is no profit, so what is the manufacturer's survival?
So they have a big increase in the price of the fake, so that they can ensure their profit space.
Therefore, most manufacturers are pushing the idea of listening, not bags.
And there are so many manufacturers who have to pay tens of millions of dollars or even tens of billions of dollars every year for advertising, where is the money coming from?
Everyone can imagine.
So with the development of society, the cost of promoting the market, such as the cost of promotional personnel at the market, the cost of display at the market, the cost of gifts for products, and the cost of advertising, is also increasing.
So each manufacturer is constantly adding new products, and they are listening to the price is constantly rising. Actually, this is the new product that comes out with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the increase in their raw materials costs will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, not to spare any means. They are linked to the doctors at the hospital, and they are assisted by them to promote the products. The profits are between 30 yuan and 80 yuan.
And China's relevant laws are absolutely not allowed to do such a method of operation. In fact, this method is actually harming consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bags of infant formula in advance, so that they can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of the formula.
And you should not think that the sound packaging's shelf life is longer than the bag packaging. If the sound packaging and the bag packaging's shelf life are the same after opening the package, it means that the sound packaging after opening the package is less likely to be preserved and more likely to be affected by moisture and deterioration.

Don't let people get scared at the start - Xinhua
When you go to the book market, you often feel the boom of success books.
Today's success books often promote the "optimal principle" - that is, to assume or imply that you can "do" and then tell you what you need to do.
That is to say, it suddenly crosses over the "how to do it" actually the most important and fundamental part.
For this reason, all of these books have a common characteristic - either to do the best you can, or to do nothing at all; either 100, or 0. Or you go to the mountain, or you stay at home.
This "optimal principle" makes anyone who looks at it admit that it is "right." However, 99% of people will be shaken in the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "daring to make a 180-degree change", which is exactly the weakness of many people.
For people who are unwilling to change, who are unwilling to change, who are resistant to change, you have to shout at his ear that you want to change, which is obviously a lie and a play with the ox.
Most people will show hesitation in front of the word "change", stay back, and be unable to make a decision; or they will make a decision based on a momentary impulse and take the first step boldly, but often it will not last for a long time, and it will be difficult to continue.
Mr. Ma's famous "From tomorrow on" monologue is the best expression of this "common human nature".
The biggest problem with the "Strictest Principle" lies in the high threshold, which often exceeds the capabilities of ordinary people, making most people "weep at the door".
Maybe the " <v>second best principle</v> " is a possible way for more ordinary people to take a relatively successful path.
The core of the " <v>second best principle</v> " is to "reduce the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "winning small by winning big", that is, if you can't win 100, you can only win 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb the mountain, you can only climb the little sand dune at your front door, because that will always be better than stagnant.
In summary, if you do something, it will be better than not doing anything.
Because the threshold has been lowered significantly, more people are likely to achieve it, and the success probability will also increase.
The success path just follows the "less is more" principle.
In summary, the "optimal principle", despite appearing to drive everyone to success on the surface, ultimately can only motivate a small number of people; the "less good principle", on the other hand, can motivate more people and make as many people benefit as possible.

The amount of raw fish resources of the Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporters骆晓飞 and Zhang Huanxiang) The reporter learned from the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of the Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the amount of Qinghai Lake naked鲤 resources this year was increased by 0.71 million tons from the previous year, reaching 10.85 million tons, which was more than 40 times more than that of the protection initial in 2002.
The naked鲤, commonly known as the "Tibetan fish," is a rare and valuable fish species in the Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in safeguarding the safety and biodiversity of the "water - fish - bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the sixties and seventies of the twentieth century, due to the factors such as the large-scale killing of aquatic animals and the decline of the aquatic environment, the number of naked鲤 in the Qinghai Lake has been reduced. In 2002, the amount of Qinghai Lake naked鲤 resources was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake naked鲤 was listed as a endangered species in the Red List of Species of China.
From 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in the lake, and has prohibited any group or individual from fishing naked鲤 in the main rivers and tributaries of the lake, and has prohibited the sale of naked鲤 and its products.
At the same time, through the artificial breeding release and the clearance of the main inflows of the Qinghai Lake, as well as the design of a scientifically reasonable "passing channel" and other measures, the amount of Qinghai Lake naked鲤 resources has increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that at present, more than 1.8 million fish of Qinghai Lake have been artificially fished and released, contributing more than 23 percent to the recovery of Qinghai Lake's fish resources.
The三江源 region in青海 is an important ecological barrier and water source in China and even Asia. The Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone to control the westward spread of desertification.
In order to protect the三江源地区 and the watershed of the Qinghai Lake, and to safeguard the ecological environment and wildlife of the Qinghai Lake, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has issued a special fishing prohibition notice for the key watershed of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake, and has built a comprehensive prohibition management system of one river and one lake.

The restaurant only gave me one bag, and I had to put it in the bag. It was cold.
Can you tell me if the delivery is in a bag?
We only saw a bag
If you want to know whether it was missed or someone took it, thank you.
It has been 1 hour and it has not yet arrived
I just saw an article about a period. It's too long.
To the unknown male.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period at the age of 13-15 and stop menstruating at the age of 50.
After being healthy, it will be more regular to come once a month.
But it is not a regular pattern that can be accurately predicted, and there is about a week of allowance, which needs to be prepared in advance, sometimes luck is bad and it will go wrong (suddenly it will go wrong a few days earlier).
The length of time, the blood loss, and the severity of cramps vary from person to person. Some have cramps for three days, while others have cramps for a week. Some have little blood loss, while others have blood loss. Some people have no reaction, while others have severe pain. The cramps will change with time, and the cramps before were not always painful.
The menstrual flow cannot be controlled for a few days, and the bleeding will continue for 24 hours, so only the use of tampons or pads can be done to prevent the bleeding on the clothes and chairs.
Diarrhea is mainly caused by the release of prostanoids. When the period is not yet over, you should take ibuprofen to effectively relieve the pain in the month. After the period begins, you should not take it.
Because of the increased blood flow in the uterus and the excessive release of prostanoids, it is easy to have diarrhea before the period.
If you suddenly have diarrhea, it will come in two days.
The sanitary napkin should be changed every two or three hours, otherwise it will easily grow bacteria, and the worst case is to change the sanitary napkin every six hours, that is, 42 pieces, if you add the pre-prepared pieces, there may be 50 pieces, not one piece every month.
(Here, the change is that the tampon should not be changed often, about 5 to 6 hours, and the longest 8 hours)
The hormones in the menstrual period may be more violent, and the ovulation period may also be unstable because of the changes in the internal hormones. It is very unfortunate, and the body makes trouble for itself.
But the official crime rate data shows that the ability of women to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotions as an excuse.
Not only does the blood flow, but also the detached uterine mucosa.
After the menstrual period, the cervical mucous membrane is the thinnest, and then gradually thickens, which can be understood as that the uterus is a house, and that the mucous membrane is built every month (the mucous membrane thickens) to welcome guests, and that the guests have not come, and that the new house is built next month (the mucous membrane thickens), and so on.
The menstrual cycle is very inconvenient. For decades, it is 24 hours of bleeding every month, and it will cause abdominal pain and back pain. Who wants it?
But the baby was born because his mother had her period. The period was to prepare you for the first time to live in a house for 10 months. We should thank our mother for regular and healthy period.
Previously, many things were suppressed for women, and society said that it was dirty, shameful, and everyone thought it was like that, but the times have changed.
If someone feels that the menstrual period is disgusting, that the preparation of the female body for the birth of life is disgusting, that it should not be said in public, the girls stood up and did not have to think about it, never experienced it and never understood it, and the men who have never experienced it and never understood it, do not have the courage to face their mothers, and do not have the courage to want their children?
Finally, sisters try to use tampons, they really work.
Today is the winter solstice, and the gift was wrong.
You need to order a separate meal for the children.
We hope that the shop should check the quality at any time during the busy time.
Do you feel tingling when you take a bath in a foot bath?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in foot therapy and health. Today, the author of the store will answer this question, and hope that it will help you.
As people's health awareness has increased, the foot bath has become more popular among consumers, and there are a number of products in the market from less than RMB 100 to more than RMB 1,000, which gives consumers a lot of choice space.
In the relevant data surface, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of foot baths and other health appliances such as foot baths are hot, but foot baths do not have a special industry standard, so there are some safety risks.
It is really dangerous to soak your feet in an electric water.
Mr. Li told the reporter that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday present. But when his father was taking a bath, his feet felt numb.
Mr Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath, but when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation on his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen and it turned on. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually charged.
Then he contacted the merchants, and the merchants' attitude was not bad, although he had withdrawn the bath tub. Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that there is no clear industry regulation on the setting of the highest temperature for the foot bath, which has been popular for a long time.
However, in general, a foot bath is unlikely to have a problem with electricity, but it is not excluded that some products were not strictly inspected at the factory.
Therefore, when buying, choose a separate foot bath.
The water and electricity are separated, there is no safety risk.
At the same time, you can take an electric pen to measure.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opened - Viewpoint Top - Hunan Daily News - Xinhua Online
Hunan Daily on October 10 (all media reporter Zhang Xianwu, Hu Wuyang, photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Expo and new tea promotion meeting was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center. The exhibition of tea industry, innovation of tea technology, promotion of tea culture, and acceleration of the goal of tens of billions of tea industry were shown.
侯顺利, Deputy Director of the Council of the General Administration of the People's Commodity and Commercial Cooperation of China and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan of Anhui Province, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Jianhua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand introduction at the opening ceremony: the source of the red tea in Lixing, and the rise of red tea as a "five-color湘茶" injected new energy.
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of the ten billion yuan Hunan tea industry, forming a development pattern of "three Hunan four water and five color tea."
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and the main tea types such as green tea, black tea, and red tea have stepped up their efforts. The main producing areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism, and have driven the tea farmers to increase their income.
The Feng Shui will change, and the red tea will take off again.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after harvesting green tea, they would harvest red tea and black tea, and that tea farmers would have income all year round. The output value of the tea garden would increase steadily.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Nujiang was honored with the "Honghu Origin".
At the newized red tea exhibition hall, Fujian tea merchants saw a high-altitude tea called "ice spring" and immediately ordered it.
Wang Jian, Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current situation and other factors affect the tea market, but from the tea expo site, the highlight is varied.
The new age red tea has a bright red hue, and has added the tea culture connotation. The Hunan tea industry greets the new spring with joy.
If these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it, because there is no place to park and he couldn't bring it up.
Formal logic is the study of questions that cannot be directly answered through sensing.
The metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy and aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" is derived from the words "metaphysics" in the "Classics of the Qi" and "metaphysics" in the "Qi". It was translated by Japanese井上哲次郎 (Meiji era) from metaphysics.
The philosophical branch includes ontology, natural theology and its extension problems.
The ontology is "researching which nouns represent real existence entities, and which nouns represent a concept."
Formal naturalism refers to denying the existence of God.
Its basic idea is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, which is supported by philosophers who support science and evolution.
The method of naturalism refers to the study of God.
Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the essence of consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain).
The two views of dualism and univocity are the two main ideas of discussing "the relationship between the soul and the body".
Knowledge theory is a branch of philosophy that studies the essence, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically considers and studies human moral life; in this case, ethics is a set of behaviors accepted by a group or a culture.
It is mainly divided into abstract ethics (abstractly research ethics theory or the essence of criticism) and normative ethics (judge different moral views and give moral suggestions for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of ethical behavior the people should follow, applies ethics (applies ethics theory to actual life conditions, including biological ethics, political ethics, etc.), describes ethics (collects information about how people live, from observed styles to summarize.
It does not examine ethics from the premise of the expected theory, but investigates the real choice made by the moral agent (moral agent) and observed by the real decision, which is the driving force for all ethical factors in this decision, and studies the ethical view held by social groups.
Ethics history includes Greek and Roman ethics, and medieval Christian ethics.
Part one: The ethics of humanism, with representatives such as瓦拉 and Montaigne.
Part II: The ethics of religious reform, with Calvin as a representative.
Part III: Political ethics, with Machiavelli and others as representatives, and modern ethics (17th-18th century, British experience ethics, represented by Hume and others, 17th-18th century, European rational ethics, represented by Spinoza and others, 18th century, French enlightenment ethics, represented by Voltaire and others, 18th-19th century, German Academy ethics, represented by Descartes and others, 18th-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, represented by Bentham and others, 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, represented by Spencer and others, 19th century, new Kantian ethics, represented by Locke and others, 19th century, new Hegel ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Greene, and transitional ethics (non-rational ethics, represented by Kierkegaard,叔本华 and Nietzsche).
Logic is a discipline that studies "the principles and standards of effective inference and proof".
Logic usually includes three parts: syllogism, deduction and induction, and can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.
The aesthetics is a discipline focused on the study of the essence and significance of beauty.

丁子霖: To my friends.
I sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance during the 30 years after my family's death, especially since I had called for humanitarian assistance abroad and in the United States in my personal capacity in the early 1994.
Nowadays, most of the deceased victims’ old parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up to be employed.
Your bravery helped us through the most difficult time.
At present, the COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping the world, and most of the donors have retired.
Therefore, I implore you to stop donating to the Mother Group of Tiananmen Square, a humanitarian aid activity that should have been completed long ago.
I will always remember your kindness and believe that your actions will be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me!
May you accept my sincere blessings.
陶业按：Let me introduce you to the history of the United States of America (US) and the Minnesota Chinese Democratic Foundation (MCDF) for humanitarian aid for 32 years.
In the course of humanitarian assistance, the United States School of the United States and the Minnesota Chinese Democratic Foundation are parallel organizations. The implementer of the project often crosses.

The aid was often not delivered to the people of Tiananmen Square in a timely manner.
In 1994, under the advice of Ding teacher, a special group was set up to coordinate and handle the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, the MCDF set up the "6.4 orphan education fund", which was implemented for 11 years. In 2009, after graduating from all the 6.4 orphans, the MCDF set up the "6.4 poor old people special care fund", and has been implemented to this day.
The funds for these projects are mainly from donations from the campus and society during the Six-Day War and from individual donations. They are also supported by the Brother University Democratic Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Prison Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the people of Tiananmen Square finally received a donation from Hong Kong in the name of Tiananmen Square.
During this period, China Human Rights also independently carried out its humanitarian rescue project.
We understand that Mr. Ding called for the suspension of the donation to the Tiananmen Square on April 6 was to consider the donors. We are all retired old people, and our income is not as abundant as it was before retirement. We sincerely thank Mr. Ding for his “Letter to Friends”.
We will respect their decision and terminate the project within two years, and restore it in the event of need.
Thank you and respect to those who have been generous and risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid for years.

Package price: 1000 yuan
Thank you for the review of the rabbit. I originally said that the rejection of the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style. But when the finished product came out, it was so beautiful.
Thanks to DanDan's recognition, your satisfaction will give us energy to continue forward and we will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great and highly recommended to all of you!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography and post-production, it is unbeatable.
The makeup artist is very delicate, and can match your style with makeup that suits you. The makeup used by the makeup artist is also high-end brands.
Of course, Liu Yanyan is even more professional than a photographer.
The whole studio is very artistic, and there are two little cats to play with.
We are working in Beijing. All the photo studios in Beijing need to queue up for 6 months in advance. Some of my colleagues have been working in Beijing. I have watched the finished film and found it just so so.
I have been searching for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and we feel that this is the short version of most people. Photographer Li Ge will take pictures and record the natural and beautiful moments.
Make-up artist, photographer, post-production, a fine team.
We and everyone around us were amazed at the sight.
She has already recommended her friend to go, and her friend has just seen the negative film as well.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, and more people will find it and make it their style, rather than being uniform.
Thank you very much for the five-star review of Qi Yue and Xiao Ling, both of whom are very creative and thoughtful newcomers. We are a creative studio, and we will do our best to complete the job even if the customer doesn't like it. Thank you for meeting me.
The sweet and kind assistant, and the lively and lively photographer teacher, every member of the team is super nice. A wonderful shoot, a wonderful experience, and the result is much better than I expected. Everyone worked hard. Thank you so much. 😘😘
Thank you for the review by Xiaoyu. It is a chance to meet you. Our trust in you is the same as the distance of thousands of kilometers. I am happy to meet you. Next time, I will come to Qingdao to play.

A programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to train in a place, but if you do not have this idea, it is better to learn by yourself, because the training cost is very high and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you are planning to get into this industry, training is definitely a good choice, especially for those who are weak in their ability to self-control.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, we should look at the strength of the institution's teachers. If the strength of the teachers is not strong enough, the training institution will have little meaning. Of course, some new training institutions have not been very strong.
Secondly, before choosing the training institution, you should inquire about this training institution, and you should inquire about the students who have graduated from this training institution, because only the students who have graduated from this training institution know what the course is about.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer this question, because I don't have a certain introduction to your situation, and the relationship between learning this thing and your situation is very important.
For example, your specialty, your age, your interest in learning a language, and even where in the city you want to study or want to work, these will be related to you.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or if you have graduated from a computer-related field, I would personally suggest learning by yourself, which is the least efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also quite good, but it takes a lot of time and money to learn, so you need to focus training for 3-6 months.
However, if I say these cases, it is very convenient to learn by myself. Nowadays, many online learning resources are free, or you can go to b站 for many training resources. If you can't find the resources, you can contact me and get free resources or detailed consulting.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, then it is recommended to go to the training institution to learn, so that the learning is not very difficult, the teacher's explanation is very detailed, and there are people who can answer the problem. In addition, in the planning or supervision, it is also helpful.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal promotion places, and recommend them to companies after learning, so that the interview for jobs after learning can also save a lot of things.
Here are some of my opinions, as I mentioned before, because I don't know your situation, I only give you a rough introduction and don't give you a detailed introduction. If you have any other questions, you can contact me at any time.
I said that I saw it before 1.
What is it?
I haven't said it yet, what are you doing?
I, on the other hand, take on all kinds of (installation, cleaning, repair), wall-mounted hot water heater, water purifier, washing machine, dryer, air conditioner, toilet, stove, window cleaner, glass cleaner, and home services.
Thank you for those who gave me a thumbs up. To work hard for life. Life is hard but I have to keep going.
Life will not let anyone down, and if you like, you can follow me on Instagram. Thank you for those who give me a thumbs up.
Life is like this, others only look at the result, and we have to bear the process of facing life. In the face of life, besides being strong, we have to continue, and there is no choice but to continue. We can turn back, but we cannot turn back.
Cleaning is a job, and it is also a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is beautiful because of care.
We clean the most dirty job, but we will do it with the most serious attitude. We will clean every corner of the client's house cleanly, and we will see the satisfied smile on the client's face and the raised thumb, and all the hard work will pay off!
My daily work
-Your request, my service.
Serving with care, cleaning with care, and keeping the beauty.
The details you care about, such as cleaning the house, will be done for you. I can do it for you. I love you.
The family is clean, the tree is clean, the service is perfect, and the family is clean.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
The crystal light is beautiful, but it will become dull and dim if it is not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can it shine brightly. The same is true for life.
To succeed, you have to do it with your heart. To make it perfect, you have to do it with care. We are serious.
Give me the opportunity, and I will definitely make you satisfied, quality means everything, because professional is worth being trusted, and your trust is my encouragement!
The current industry is not easy to do!
But I always believe that if I take a serious attitude, be consistent, and work hard, I will be better than others at least."!
The moment of the day is in the morning. All good things begin in the morning. Hope you carry happiness, luck, health, and happiness when you start a new day. Good morning!
When I was a child, happiness was a thing; when I grew up, happiness was a goal; when I was mature, I found that happiness was a mental state, and I understood it.
Do the most authentic and kindest of yourself, follow your heart, have no regrets in this life; life is a road, follow your own path; two treasures in life: good health and good mood, live a beautiful life to the end!
In every stage of life, there will be different problems.
Many times, not your ability but your willingness to face the challenge is what holds you back.
If you can't avoid it, then face it.
If you are afraid, you will be defeated by difficulties; if you dare to face difficulties, the problem will be solved.
Chinese and Saudi策展人合作举办沙特首届当代艺术双年展新华网
Xinhua News Agency Riyadh, December 12 (reporters Wang Huiyao and Hu Chong) - Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art two-year exhibition - Dali Contemporary Art Two-Year Exhibition, officially opened to the public in Dali JAX art zone in the west of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on December 11. 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participated in the exhibition.
The two-year exhibition was jointly organized by the Saudi-Dariya Foundation and the Chinese UCCA Yunnan Contemporary Art Center. The director of the Chinese UCCA Yunnan Contemporary Art Center, Xu Xiaoyu, was the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this two-year exhibition is "rock climbing through the river", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the economic transformation in the era of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
This two-year exhibition occupies nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition hall spans six connected buildings. It is presented in six units: "Grimping the Rock", "Transmission as an Experiment", "Fringe Thinking", "Going to the Public", "Wonderful New World" and "Art's Mentality."
Among them, 27 Saudi artists' works accounted for more than 40% of the total number of the exhibited works, including painting, installation art and performance art; and 12 Chinese artists' works were equally popular, some artists using recycled materials in a novel way, such as Xu Jing in the 2014 series of "The Last Story" (The Last Story, The Last Story, The Last Story), reimagining a classic landscape painting with waste materials.
Barclay, chief executive of the Dali Biennale Foundation, said he hoped that this biennale would establish international dialogue and allow the global audience to learn about the flourishing cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia and strengthen interaction.
田霏宇 said: "The aim of the biennial is double. It not only allows Saudi Arabia's contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, but also allows Saudi Arabia's audience to integrate into the contemporary art world."
It is reported that a series of lectures will be held during the opening week of the second year. Artists, curators and ideological leaders in the creative industry will discuss cross-cultural exchanges, contemporary art development and other themes.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of village public service positions - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (reporter Lin Bingfeng): In order to continue to provide employment assistance for the poor, consolidate and expand the results of the poverty eradication, Yunnan Province has recently issued policies to promote the management of public service positions in rural areas to help in the overall promotion of rural revitalization.
The relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial People's Employment and Social Security Department said that at present, Yunnan has developed 4.83 million village public service jobs, which are used to provide employment for rural disadvantaged groups such as the poor and the poor, and to help the poor achieve employment growth and increase their income, consolidate the results of the poverty eradication drive, and effectively improve the capabilities of various public services in the countryside.
This new regulation was jointly issued by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of Yunnan, Rural Renewal and Development, and Finance, and was mainly aimed at uniformizing the scope of the target group for recruiting village public service staff, the management of funds, the development of posts, and the management of posts.
In the staff development setting, the new regulations clearly state that according to the principle of "need-based staffing, on-the-job training, dynamic management, and total control" and "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible" and "one person for one job, voluntarily public, and unified management", the staff development setting should be set.
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of notice, declaration, inspection, publicity, appointment, on-the-job training and placement.
In addition, the new rules also define the specific responsibilities of the development departments of village public welfare posts, the subsidy standard and the subsidy method of village public welfare posts, and stipulate that the development departments of village public welfare posts should purchase accident insurance for village public welfare posts personnel; and that the relevant departments should periodically monitor the subsidy distribution of village public welfare posts.

Hello
Can you cancel the order?

Is it cancelled?
Second, although the right-wing has a prosperous era in history, it is short, so it is short because it gives a little sunshine and a little hot water; if it is prosperous, it wants to climb the mountain, if it is hit, it wants to cling to the grass.
However, in reality, the right-wing played a positive role in social progress.
The positive significance of the right-wing should not be negated from the perspective of ending the definition of truth standards, developing the economy, improving science and technology and promoting political institutionalization and human rights protection.
Three. As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with Li Weidong's some opinions, I care about his opinions and respect him. Because he is serious, he is serious about China and the social problems in China.
But I object to his anti-communist theory, and I believe that anti-revolutionary revolution is inevitable, and that revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, loss of human life, and the confusion of political groups.
Four. Change or improve China should have patience and a sense of responsibility for the country and the people, and those who try to make political gains in the fire are not right-wingers, but idiots.
Let's talk again.
Left, in fact, is a bunch of time and political orphans.
If the right has a positive impact on society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right's opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed, while the left will not, because the left wants what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Five. I recently saw some friends yelling at the enemy while arguing with them, and I felt that it was not necessary.
Do not try to argue with the traitor or the lunatic, both of whom are stubborn and unreasonable.
And don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make the traitor and the idiot admit, why?
I told my friends this: when the fools call you five yuan, when the lunatics call you dog, it proves that our middle road is right!
Many people had ideals when they were young, but they forgot them when they were old, or pursued ideals, but they became obsessed.
And the pursuit of the ideal is getting farther and farther away, and even the young lion is becoming a dragon.
I think that the term "right" and "left" refers to the constraint and freedom respectively. According to the history and culture of China, the overall direction of China should be left.
On the other hand, the domestic right-wing freedom is focused on efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthening supervision is more focused on fairness and security.
Now the general public wants to focus more on fairness, while China and the United States are fighting, and the left is certain, and it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, I can just like it.
Nothing more to say, just that the flower is so brave
In the past two years, the blockade and blockade of the US against Huawei chips have not only brought Huawei into unprecedented trouble, but also caused huge losses for "US-based" enterprises.
The United States has imposed a blockade on the Chinese chip industry, forcing its own and its allies' related enterprises to block the Chinese chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence is that the global chip supplier's orders and profits will be affected, causing the research and development investment of chip production enterprises to decrease and the production capacity to decrease, resulting in the shortage of the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the shortage of semiconductors has hit all sectors of the world, such as the suspension of car production and the rise of mobile phones, and all industries that use semiconductors are affected.
In order to control the “chip” autonomy, more and more powerful technology giants are starting to move towards the “decoration” road.
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control rights, and to restrict the development of China's semiconductor industry, the US recently made frequent moves. It was also the host of the "chip summit". It was also invited by 64 major players in the semiconductor industry to form a semiconductor alliance, and it was also funded to support the US-based technology giants, such as the US-based technology giant Intel to regain the leadership in the semiconductor industry. It was also funded to build two wafer processing plants in the United States in Arizona, and to open the chip manufacturing business to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC and be likely to take away TSMC's "job".
This is because Intel, as a major American technology giant, has been investing in semiconductors for decades and has a large talent team and technical reserves. It is certain to rise up quickly and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, for the decision by Intel, the founder of TSMC, Zhang Kejiang was indifferent.
At the "2021 Master智库论坛" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmai spoke out of the box. He did not hesitate to speak out of the box at the "2021 Master智库论坛". He said that Intel is building a chip factory, which is quite ironic.
Zhang Keqiang dislikes Intel's move into the chip industry because he still has grudge against Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel 30 years ago.
In the sixties and seventies, Intel was always a jewel in the crown of the United States' manufacturing industry. It was at the top of the world in the semiconductor industry.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chip was controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip was completed by a factory from design to packaging. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model has made some small enterprises unbearable, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs have to look away from huge production line construction costs.
In the wake of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show the phenomenon of division and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongjiang heard that there were special companies specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there were special companies specializing in design, then it could be established a special factory for wafer manufacturing.
Shortly after, Zhang Kejiang's idea turned into reality, and TSMC was born.
Taiwan Semiconductor plans to focus on the single step of "晶圆加工", not design, and provide only wafer manufacturing services.
At that time, the newly established Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was just a junior in front of Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Kejiang once sought Intel investment, but at that time, Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing process of the chip industry, it was obviously arrogant, and it refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Keqiang also believed that Intel was despised at that time.
You may not have expected that the big players in the semiconductor manufacturing service industry would have to start doing the wafer manufacturing.
So, Zhang Keqiang thought that Intel's entry into the wafer manufacturing was ironic.
Nowadays, TSMC's market value has exceeded Intel.
In the face of the strong offensive of TSMC, Intel was also not able to remain silent.
Nowadays, TSMC has been pushing towards 3nm chips, while Intel has been stuck at 7 years ago at 14nm.
It is not easy to catch up.
Don't wait
It has been ordered 2 hours ago at 19:06.
Today, let's look at some strange hot topics.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly choose three hot topics: February 2nd's rising of the Dragon, the rise of Lixing Friend and the case of goods拉拉, and the spread of the public opinion formed a wave peak, and then the "指数下降" (smooth curve) finally disappeared. If there is secondary public opinion, there will be a small驼峰 again.
They look similar to the model shown on the Internet Information Office's official website.
What is an abnormal public opinion?
Randomly choose six hotspots from the same event, showing a "monolith", "slicing edge", and "dividing cliff".
The "solitary peak" refers to artificial heating, which quickly rises to the top of the hot search list, and attracts the attention of the public; the "symmetrical peak" refers to periodic heating, which ensures the topic occupies the top of the hot search list, and the "divide and conquer" refers to collective evacuation, which ensures that the hot search can play its "function" and go to the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the hot peak of one event coincides exactly with the cold peak of the other event, and the time difference is not more than a few seconds, which is undoubtedly a unified batch of watermen who received the mission to launch a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black public relations is evident: dozens of hot trending topics simultaneously on the list, which attracts people's attention, which is responsible for publicity, which drives the war, which moves people's eyes, which affects cognition, which misleads judgment, which drives emotions, which entices decisions, which are detailed in stages and nodes, almost all of the elements in the dissemination of public opinion.
The dissemination is a science, let alone the position, emotion, all subjective factors, and just from the objective data, black public relations will also disappear.
Every time you walk, you leave a trail. This trail, we will dig it out together.

Mauritius and other countries have discovered the first cases of infection with the Omiyak strain of the poisonous bacteria - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 12 (Xinhua) -- According to the reports of foreign reporters of Xinhua News Agency, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have reported for the first time that they have detected the infection cases of the variant virus of Opimicin.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of infection with the Omisken strain on the 10th.
According to the Minister of Public Health Kailash Jagadapal, one of the infected persons was a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27; the other infected person was a local resident of Mauritius who had contact with a recent person who had visited South Africa and returned to Mauritius on November 30.
After being quarantined at the hospital, the two infected persons' nucleic acid test results turned negative. They have now returned to their hometowns.
The Cyprus Health Ministry announced on October 10 that it had confirmed the first three cases of infection with the Omyakon strain.
The three were students and came back from abroad earlier this month. They were all mild cases and did not require hospital treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omink戎毒株, the Sez government has been increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, all 12-year-old and older passengers entering the country by plane will have to pay a fee to undergo a nucleic acid test at the airport.
On the 10th day of the month, the State Health Department also announced that it would start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in the country with the Pfizer vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Qubiza Chimpinda, said on September 9 that the country had discovered the first three cases of infection with the Opimuki strain.
The country's health department sequenced the genomes of 12 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and discovered the three infected cases.

Initially, it was recommended by a friend because of trust, so I chose to see. At first, my budget was 7,000.
He started a series of tricks at the shop.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my floor plan, and they didn't measure the house on the spot, so they could quote me that my 135 property was worth 7 million, and I didn't know what materials they were using.
Their second trick is that once you go to the store, you will be dragged to pay the deposit (and this money will never be withdrawn unless you have enough experience to fight with them in theory).
When I was hesitating whether or not to pay a deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that you can get a certain discount if you pay the deposit today.
This is a big hole, and I am the example of being cheated by my brain impulses. I paid more than 1,000 yuan in advance.
He gave me a lot of questions, including 7,000 without water and electricity renovation, and without any doors and cabinets in the bathroom. These three are the main costs.
In addition, their service charges are higher than those of other companies.
I lost my trust in this company, and I didn't have time to explain everything to me before signing the contract.
When I went to ask them for the money, they showed a lot of experience, with a special team to deal with you.
Either way, it is the customer's problem. They are not responsible.
All kinds of excuses and many details, I don't want to say them all, but don't choose them, because my friend's house is also not good quality, and you will have to pay for it later.
Terrible, they are the original head decoration that deceived people, now they are changed into great beauty, and now they are changed into other things.
So don't choose such a terrible contractor.
Then, when choosing, you can search for these on the Internet and check them out. Because the renovation is not a small amount.

This is so terrifying, please cancel the order within 30 minutes!
Isn't there another way? For example, changing address?
Okay, then don't cancel the conversation. If you don't refund me within 5 to 10 days, I will take action.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes.

The sky is full of stars - the Pleiades meteor shower arrives at its peak on the 14th - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (reporter Zhou Yiquan) - As the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Polaris流星雨, which is one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will come to a climax on December 14. If you are a fan of meteor showers, you can observe it at night after midnight that day.
Beijing天文爱好者安久在青海拍摄的双子座流星雨。
Most of the meteor showers’ parent bodies are asteroids, but the parent body of the Pleiades meteor shower is the 3200th asteroid, Faeghan, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Pleiades meteor shower is also the second one that is not caused by comets.
Xiao Jianpeng, member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in天文科普, said that like a Christmas movie, the double-hemisphere meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year. "The screening date" can be extended from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability, and is called the third big meteor shower in the Northern Hemisphere.
One significant feature of the Sagittarius Ceti流星雨 is that the meteorite speed is slow, the color is rich, and there are a lot of fire meteors. It is suitable for both sightseeing and amateur astronomical photography.
Yu Jie, an amateur astronomer in Tianjin, photographed the double star nebula on December 13, 2020.
According to the astronomical forecast, the double-phoenix meteor shower will arrive at its peak on the 14th and 15th of the month of December. At the peak, ZHR (in the ideal observation condition, the radiation point is above the head) is 150.
The recommended index of the Sagittarius Ceti.
Last year, the 'fallen flower' double-horned meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's double-horned meteor shower will be influenced by the moonlight, and the show will be a little less impressive.
On the 14th day of the lunar month of the eleventh year of the lunar calendar, the lunar phase is a full moon, and the bright moon will cause interference in the observation. Fortunately, the moon will come down at the end of the night, and the radiation point of the Pleiades meteor shower will also rise higher at that time.
Those who like the meteor shower can observe the meteor shower in the afternoons of the last few hours of the moon falling. However, it is necessary to take care of the cold and warmth. "
How can we observe more meteors?
It is not advisable to observe in the city. You can choose a place with a high elevation, little light pollution and a wide view of the north-east, and then wait patiently until the moon is down to observe in the sky.
It is necessary to pay attention to the fact that the Sagittarius Ceti流星雨 flows in all directions, so it is not necessary to keep looking at the Sagittarius Ceti radiation point all the time.
If you are a fan of photography, it is better to choose a wide-angle and large aperture lens to capture a brilliant "asteroid shower". When shooting, use a high ISO and the maximum aperture.
Based on stability and continuity, the tripod, spare battery and shutter line are also indispensable. "
He reminded that.
What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in the market positioning?
My understanding is that the traditional TV mentioned by the subject refers to the liquid crystal TV, while the difference in market positioning between the laser TV and the liquid crystal TV is mainly two points:
First, laser TV focuses on the large screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of the LCD television, the laser television clearly focuses on the large screen market, that is, the laser television itself is a product for the large screen.
At present, the mainstream LCD television size is generally 55 inches to 65 inches, while the laser television size is generally 75 inches or more, and the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meeting the user's demand for large-screen televisions.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TV in global sales and sales has been increasing, and it has exceeded 60% in the overall TV sales of more than 80 inches.
According to CIIHK's prediction, in 2020, the sales of laser TV will increase by more than 140%, continuing to maintain a high growth rate.
The good performance in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in protecting eyesight.
Based on the imaging principle of the reflected light of the laser television, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eye. Compared with the backlight source of the liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object in natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is smaller.
China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute (CESTI) conducted a strict comparison test of laser television and liquid crystal television under the same conditions with the same audience, and obtained 144 test data.
Data confirms: Laser TV has a strong eye-catching property, and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when the importance of vision health has increased, laser televisions not only attracted more and more users, but also opened a new breakthrough for the television market.
Second, laser TV focuses on the high-end market.
In contrast to the downward trend of the LCD TV price, the current market price of laser TV is generally higher than 100,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price gradually increases.
Why is the laser TV so expensive?
Of course, it is right.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, the laser television has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD and projection television.
With the super-short focus projection technology, the projection distance of the laser television is shorter than that of the traditional projection equipment. It can achieve 100-inch big screen experience in a short distance, and the space requirement is not so great, and the main body is small and occupies little space.
In terms of brightness, large brands of laser TV can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, it has a lower heat output and a smaller loss of equipment. The lifetime of the television is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models also include 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, and virtual screen, which can give users a more shocking visual and auditory experience.
It is not a fake demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and investment and output ratio, the laser TV is not a game for the sound player. If you want to balance the big screen and the viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. After weighing the pros and cons, you can judge it yourself. It is better to be safe than sorry.
In simple words, the ultra-wide-angle near-focus projection machine--laser TV has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors to be close to the screen, which is not in line with the optical optimal design.
In order to block some environmental light, use a micro-structure Fresnel screen, which is costly, and the price of 80 inches is basically the same as that of 65 inches.
And there is one more thing, I really hate the manufacturers of the projection equipment to use the mirror reflection as a selling point. Please, the light that can be seen on the screen of the projection equipment is the direct light, and the light that can be seen by the eyes of the eyes is the direct light. The light that can be seen by the eyes of the eyes on the screen of the projection equipment is the direct light. Isn't the ceiling of the television screen also illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not a reflective screen, it can't be like.
The hot spot effect of the high gain screen (light spot) was overlooked, and the fact that a large amount of light was reflected back to the eyes at a certain angle was just too painful.
The photo and visual art and visual art and visual art and visual art photography and visual art photography and visual art photography and visual art and visual art photography and visual art and visual art photography
I added the date of the appointment on the WeChat, and the sister put the available time for me. The reply was timely.
Before going, I had a look at the store's photography work, more of which was outdoor wedding photos, which were very beautiful and involved a variety of shooting styles.
After arriving at the party, I talked to my sister about my thoughts and asked her to help me try on two styles of clothes that I struggled with. Finally, I decided to start my make-up look. The photographer would set up some props before shooting, and would guide the action, and would also be very careful with every detail.
But maybe because I didn't communicate with you about the specific shooting ideas, the style that I wanted to shoot was not what I wanted to shoot, but it was pretty. 🙊🙊
After shooting, the photographer will help choose photos, exchange the style of post-production, and feel quite careful.
The repaired film will take about half a month, waiting for the effect~
For the second time, I won a photo-tasting霸王餐 event. Most of the clothes could be chosen for a photo.
Finally, she chose a black silk skirt to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about two hours. The photographer who is responsible for the shooting is a 95-year-old brother. I feel a little awkward at first, but I hope that I can give more suggestions on the shooting process in the future. He is very talkative and enjoys the shooting process.

It's on the first page, and you can also check Queenie.
I filled in the name and phone number before going to the store, and I could choose the wedding dress. I changed three or four dresses for a while, and I was very patient. After choosing the dress, I had to wait for a long time for the make-up. The service was also good. After shooting, I would teach you how to put on the make-up. However, the feeling on my face was a bit big, and I had to wait for a few days before I could receive the finished product.
The environment is generally good.
There are many options for clothing.
There are about three makeup spots in the studio.
The service was very warm and careful.
The hairstylist was patient.
The photographer will also be very serious about teaching you the movements.
Not satisfied, the photographer will also be willing to take a photo.
(Experience) The style may have been a bit overdone. The original eyelid was split into three eyelids.
The eyebrows were also shaved. It was a bit awkward for some people not to draw eyebrows.
The picture was taken ten days ago, but the P picture effect was not very satisfactory. I felt that the eyelid piercing was still obvious.
Because it was not clear what style I wanted, I tried two styles. Finally, I chose the black dress. The little sister said that this style was more retro.
After choosing the right clothes, I started to make my hair and makeup. The hairstylist and makeup artist were very patient in helping me make it. The result was very satisfactory.
After making my makeup and hair, I started taking pictures. The photographer was always encouraging me to pose. The process was very easy and harmonious.
After shooting, I carefully selected four of my favorite photos for editing. The little guy said that within 15 minutes of shooting, it would be complete. I was very satisfied at the end.
I've been without a response for three days... because your system can't identify my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card for every payment
I have to pay the fee every time now
Can I be exempted from paying my monthly fee?
Does a small umbrella buy insurance?
The small umbrella is an internet insurance broker platform.
From the point of view of setting conditions: according to the Insurance Broker Regulatory Authority (IBRA) in 2015, if you want to become an insurance broker, you must meet the following three keywords: shareholders, the initiator in the past three years has no major violations of law, and the minimum limit is RMB 500 million. You must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC).
The three actually are very strict, summarized, and it means that you must have strength, must be approved by the State Authorities of the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (BIRC) and must have a good attitude of shareholders. As a small umbrella insurance for insurance brokers, the small umbrella insurance for insurance brokers, the insured person does not need to question whether the small umbrella insurance is legitimate or not, since there are three thresholds, and not all insurance companies can reach them.
In this regard, it is not bad, and is worth trusting.
From the insurance product point of view: The umbrella insurance is a insurance supermarket. Many companies' star life insurance are sold on this platform. For example, the latest on the and泰超级玛丽5号 life insurance, the insurer and the insurer are the same as the and泰人寿. The umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary. You don't need to question its reliability.
From the point of view of payment mode: The products of the Internet platform are generally more competitive than the products of the traditional channels because they are less expensive than the operating costs of the branch offices and the salaries of the salesmen, so the products of the Internet platform are generally more competitive than those of the traditional channels, and the payment mode is flexible, supports monthly payment, reduces the payment pressure of the insurer, and at the same time can fully leverage the lever of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the point of view of professionalism: This is especially important, because insurance is a highly professional industry, and many Internet products can be insured by customers themselves, so there will be many misunderstandings in this area, and in the field of health notification and professionalism, non-insured professionals often add their own subjective consciousness when insuring, believing that they are healthy or fit, so that there are many potential liabilities for reimbursement.
I have done insurance phone sales for myself in "Tencent Micro Insurance" (the same as a raincoat), which is an Internet insurance broker platform. I tell everyone very responsible.
Internet insurance is real and credible, and unreliable is the person. The Internet channel has no professional staff, and there are many sales misguided.
For example, 1 yuan insurance covers 600 million, you can buy insurance and get a mobile phone, you can get 6 million of the premium of the life insurance, but these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are not enough to tell the insured person that the first month is 1 yuan, the second month is normal cost, and the premium varies from 20 to 200 yuan, and many customers are not clear about what they paid for a few years.
You think you can spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company will pay 60 million (the world is falling off the cake).
The free gift of mobile phone is only given to the special insurance number such as 66666, 88888, etc. If the winning message is sent, you will not have to exchange it, and no one will remind you.
(This is another pitfall for the insured) Free to get 6,000 life insurance limit, is short-term, if only relying on this, there is no other commercial insurance, and if there is a serious disease, 6,000 can do what, solve the problem, and the life begins to run naked.
At present, the misguided sales of Internet insurance have been severely punished by the state.
Therefore, overall, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, and the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
The author suggests that the subject should consider the matter in a comprehensive and cautious manner. In fact, many offline insurance brokers’ products are more extensive, and the opportunities and products are more numerous. Some products are also more favorable than the Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers, insured offline products, and saved the cost of insurance for each person at 2000-3000 yuan/year.
If you have any questions, please contact me and communicate with me.
Me: Mingya Insurance Broker, I have 3 years of enterprise management training experience, served more than 1,000 enterprises users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies, and will tailor insurance products for customers from the customer's needs before insurance. In the course of insurance, I will do my best to win the best insurance results for customers from three insurance companies. In the course of insurance, I will organize the insurance documents for customers and make them safe and worryfree.
Growing with each customer.
I hope my answer will help the subject!
According to the definition of insurance supervision department, internet insurance is a type of insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance process by clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insurer autonomously.
Although the insurance of the Internet insurance is not as "ceremonious", even if the printed paper contract is not printed, it is still effective and legal.
This model, a bit like "telephone sales," has a fatal flaw: the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades, so when we buy insurance, should we really think about the "middle man" we choose, which is a "middle man" that can be with us for a long time and will also provide us with services many years later?

Thank you for helping
From the beginning to now, I have always opposed any form of calumny and abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eradicate this bastard.
If you don't look at the party and the faction, the first thing to be countered is this unsophisticated style.
From when you started asking for Facebook friends to when you tried to post your father's name on social media, I have been unresponsive.
After that, you have become more and more insistent not only to continue tagging me, but also to continue discussing with your so-called friends on Facebook about me some obscure, humiliating remarks, such as my appearance, my body shape, my good health, and so on, and so on, and so on. I... I...
But then I received several friends' messages about your Facebook friends' photos and comments about your face.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't continue to be silent.
After uploading the news on my complaint, you have no mercy and are even more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are or what status you are, in our society, it is necessary for men and women to respect each other.
Yes, you can continue this kind of humorous, concealed, humiliating and insulting speech, or you can continue to say that you care and care about me, or you can continue to say that it isn't harassment, or you can continue to deny that it isn't your design, or you can continue to publish all offensive statements.
No, I can't and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My looks and figure don't need you to judge.
I even don't think that any girl would be willing to let someone so humiliate herself to get famous.
My friend asked me, how are you?
I said so, and you won't believe it.
I think no girl would have been so bullied and still be able to say that she was okay.
Only those who have no basic ethics will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of people.
I cut some comments for you to judge
You should not be able to fake it yourself.
I can only say that you are a civilization enemy.

Vietnamese People’s Daily - Prime Minister Nguyen Minh Triết attended the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
During the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major meetings were held to discuss the themes of digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation and digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development during the pandemic.

US Three航母集结中国周边 最强大武器罕见访问关岛，2022-01-17 多维 亲中共媒体 多维报道：中美关系的最新消息：最新卫星图像显示，美国的三艘航母正在中国周边集结；美国媒体还披露，美国海军武器库中最强大的武器之一罕见的访问关岛，对印太地区美国的盟友和对手释放重要信号。
According to the China智库“南海战略态势感知平台”, on September 9, a satellite found a US carrier "Vinson" (USS Carl Vinson) in the vicinity of the Barabbas Strait.
The Baracuk Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic place on the first island chain in the western Pacific.
The platform predicts that the "Karl文森" will deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the F-35C fighter aircraft and the CMV-22 “fish-eagle” carrier transport aircraft on the “Carl Vinson” frigate.
The U.S. Navy is currently sailing in the Pacific Northwest. Besides the "Carl Vinson" (USS Abraham Lincoln), there is also the "Abraaham Lincoln" (USS Abraham Lincoln) from the United States.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C fighter aircraft squadron for the first time. The squadron is part of the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two frigates, the US Navy is currently deploying the Ronald Reagan (USS Ronald Reagan) frigate in the Asia-Pacific region.
The frigate battle group also includes the “Shaplan Lake” missile cruiser and the “Starkard” missile destroyer.
Three U.S. Navy ships are assembled in the vicinity of China for the first time, and the most powerful weapon rarely visits the island of Guam in 2022. On January 17, 2022, the “Antarctic Situation Sensing Platform” released the latest satellite images, showing that the three U.S. Navy ships were assembled in the vicinity of China.
(Twitter @南海战略态势感知) Three U.S. Navy ships are assembled in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon rarely visits Okinawa in 2022. On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the U.S. Navy transport aircraft CMV-22B.
According to the @南海战略态势感知 Twitter account, the most powerful weapon in the U.S. Navy’s stockpile visited the island of Guam last weekend.
The USS "Nevada," carrying 20 three-pronged ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
Three U.S. Navy ships are assembled in the vicinity of the Chinese coastline, and the most powerful weapon is rarely visited on the island. The analysis said that this is a signal to the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first time that the ballistic missile submarine visited the island since 2016, and it was the second public visit to the island since the 1980s.
Three U.S. Navy ships are assembled in the vicinity of the Chinese coastline, and the most powerful weapon rarely visits the island of Okinawa. China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea in recent years.
The picture shows the island of Yuyuan in the South China Sea.
(South China Sea Research Forum) In the statement, the US Navy said that the俄亥俄-class nuclear submarine "Nevada號"'s visit to Guam this time strengthened the cooperation between the US and its regional allies and showed the US’s capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and commitment to regional security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
The ballistic missile submarine is usually called the Boomer submarine.
The movements of the 14 "Red Sea Submarine" of the US Navy are usually strictly secret.
The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the “雷鸣潜艇” a “most important survival weapon” in the three-sphere system, including the launch tank ballistic missile and B-52, which can carry nuclear bombs.
When talking to his friends, Zuckerberg responded that he faced "unprecedented" competition. Why?
Meta (originally Facebook) is a real advertising company, and its income is mainly from advertising. Today, the advertising company that makes money is the one that has a flow of traffic.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc., whatever the positioning of functions, is a meta traffic channel.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest 'advertising alliance'. Many apps can connect to Meta's advertising platform through Meta's advertising platform.
But the times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta can't get the user's data information again, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is friendly to users, and will be obvious to users whether or not the App allows it to obtain its own information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
If Google does another stab, the impact on Meta's income will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in the previous Meta's income growth has weakened (the proportion of this factor is not certain, but it exists).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Meta receives at least 10% of its income from China every year, mainly from the contribution of companies in China.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is around 100 people, and there are several major distributors in mainland China.
Companies in China want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is the only advertising channel that cannot be bypassed. The money spent on Meta is mostly spent on Meta.
Interestingly, now TT is one of Meta's main competitors, but in the past two years Meta has been able to make a lot of money from TT.
All the local brokers are helping Tencent to advertise there, and Meta's performance in China is quite good.
Recently, I have not specifically studied, but I will definitely not be better than before.
The stage of massive money burning by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new flow channels was not smooth.
Facebook is getting old, and new platforms, including TT, are no longer in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only focused on income, but also on the future expectation.
Obviously, Meta's expectation is not enough.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg talked about the "first universe."
The Yuan universe is definitely one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the Yuan universe is relatively long. This story is not enough to support Meta's market value in the past two or three years.
Therefore, in the next two years, Meta will be more difficult.
Although Facebook is now very prosperous, it has 1 trillion to 2 trillion dollars in income every year, but now Facebook is very nervous, and it is not good to compare it with other Internet enterprises and high-tech companies.
Although his several social software are now popular, mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., he has no confidence in the rapid development of TikTok, and the disruption is just a blink of an eye.
And making the concept of the Infinite Universe unachievable in a short time is very dangerous, so Facebook is very dangerous, and that's why Zuckerberg is changing the company name again and again, and is constantly searching for a new path, but I think his path selection is wrong, and it is a wrong path.
