Students sing the lead in the science conference of Zhejiang University Students sing the lead in the science conference
To wash your hands with air, take a breath to judge the disease, and precisely search for the sources of fog and smog. Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year of Zhejiang University, a series of brilliant academic achievements were honored.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. The research covers a wide range of fields such as the environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, and humanities education. Students started from a curious idea and created a number of high-end inventions with great application value. Some of these projects have won prizes in domestic and international competitions.
Biological sensors: Your home medical doctor
Zhang Diqiang, a doctoral student in the College of Biomedicine and Engineering, demonstrated a biological sensor on the mobile phone side that was only half the size of a smartphone.
You just need to breathe deeply. This instrument can first test your health by analyzing your breath.
Zhang Diqiang said that this sensor is connected to the smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the smartphone when the gas is emitted.
The smart wristbands that can test the health can generally test physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biological sensor uses a new material, graphene, which has a keen sense of smell that allows it to more accurately reflect the health of chemical elements.
Intelligent surgical light: Doctor's high energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won the silver medal at the 44th Geneva International發明展 this year.
Guo Linning, a student of the College of Electronics Science and Engineering, and Sun Junfei's team opened up a new idea in the defects of the traditional surgical light and invented an intelligent LED surgical shadow light.
"Many diseases can be detected and removed at an early stage, and this is related to the lighting in the operating room of the doctor."
Jing Junfei said that, for example, in the early detection of cancer, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cell will spread.
This intelligent surgical light has four light plates. Through the adjustment of the spectrum, it can enhance the differentiation of different organs in the light.
In the course of the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate of the light spot according to the needs of the operation and the personal habits of the person.
This intelligent surgical light has already been tested in the affiliated邵逸夫医院 of the Medical School of Zhejiang University and the affiliated Children's Hospital of the Medical School of Zhejiang University, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: cool and efficient
To wash your hands with water is the most common way, and you may only use soap and hand sanitizer, while some of your classmates have invented an "Air Hand Sanitizer".
Our weight can be compressed out of the air just by standing on the toilet of the device.
It feels like a tank.
The compressed air is formed into a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
So we can wash our hands clean! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiment proved that the effect of this method of hand washing is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device can only rely on our own gravity as a drive, which can ensure the cleanliness and save 91% of water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, this invention won the only gold medal at the Second Global Challenges Summit.

One of the most meaningful certificates - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the skills certificates I feel is important besides my driving license.
普及一下：急救措施其实是做发生突发事件的时候的应急救援，即在救护车来之前的抢救。
It is well known that in the process of the ambulance coming, there is actually a certain time. And this time is the most critical.
This is the time for emergency treatment.
If I really have a heart attack, a stroke, and a sudden death, the window of my life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So, those around you know how important it is to learn how to perform CPR.
When someone falls down in front of us, we can use professional knowledge to rescue them instead of just standing there and doing nothing. This kind of helpless feeling is so terrifying.
In China, we have 300 million accidental deaths every year, the most dangerous of which is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, 15% of people can be saved.
In Las Vegas casinos and hotels, 80% of people can be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%."
This is the first reaction founder Lu Le said.
If someone has a heart arrest, their breath is gone, their heartbeat is gone, and you press on their side is of no use.
It is necessary to perform artificial breathing and chest compressions to save the person.
I found that there are few people now who have the consciousness to learn emergency response. But it is too late when things happen. Therefore, I call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can react to emergencies in time.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
You can register at the local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. Students also have discounts.
PS:The last picture is a record of the goals that I wanted to complete before my 25th birthday, and the ambulance permit was added to the target list a few months ago. But it has actually been completed!
Next, I have to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I have seen a diving rescue certificate on the red book. I think it is necessary to have a diving rescue certificate to take this certificate. So, in fact, a diving rescue certificate is very useful!
I ordered #number#
Among them, 13 yuan of crab cakes!
I've never tried
How do you not write clearly?
Is it 13 yuan?
Yesterday, the #PRS_ORG# forgot the food. This time, I just ate a shrimp饺!
Because I saw that the code was effective before I entered it.
First of all, let's talk about the conclusion. I personally believe that "Far and Away" is a complete piece of garbage. In various senses.
But you say that the movie is not a highlight, and that is not true at least the score is good.
There are many kinds of bad films, and the one that makes you fall asleep in the cinema is one, and the one that makes you angry after you have watched it is another. The one like "Four Kingdoms" for the audience is like a monkey on the峨眉山, it can use countless ways to ignite your anger.
In terms of insulting the audience,韓寒真的是天賦絕倫。
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creation in the K系小说, difficult to name, and with holes like a coat of wind on the little Mac.
Even after you have watched it, you will doubt whether there is a hidden metaphor hidden in it. But when you carefully think about it, it is actually a piece of shit.
First of all, I am very difficult to understand some scenes.
The home of the main character should be on a small island in the south of the country, where he lives with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the scene was arranged for a grandpa to drive a small面包车 to take her to the Northeast to see snow.
Old people are sitting on a面包车 from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his father are very relieved.
Then the old man disappeared.
How did the main character get the business license on the scrap ship?
Why can the gangsta biker on the island easily block a mountain road?
Then a truck delivering steel bars to the middle of the road stopped at the roadside and no one could find the drivers around it.
This effect is too obvious.
Why a small criminal who is suspected of violating the law and has a poor credit rating became a deputy?
Why didn't the police come to the loan shark in the movie? The police asked whether there was any difficulty?
An adult knows how to use a smart phone, but he or she does not know how to use the key card to open the door at the hotel, and then forcefully arrange to find the hotel owner and sit outside the room for the night?
This inexplicable situation is all over the film, and because the plot is so ridiculous that I will feel pain when I remember them.
In addition to the plot, the worst thing is the main idea of the film, that is, that the film has no main idea at all, that is, a面目可憎的缝合怪.
At the beginning of the film, you may think he wants to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you may think it may be an inspiring film. At the beginning of the film, you may think it may be a drama about the survival of the small-town youth. After watching half of it, you may think it may be a drama about the struggle of the small-town youth. After watching it, you may not know what you have watched.
For most people, it is actually very familiar with various film patterns. For example, if you want to film a motorcycle racer, you will inspire + comedy, and then tell the audience how an ambitious菜鸟 is gradually moving towards success.
If you want to make a love movie, you have to tell the true story of the love between a town youth and a server girl.
If you want to reflect the reality, your story can't have anything in opposition to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle was just burned, and the role of a person who can sing and can still sing was played by Yu Zheng) so I can't go ahead and do some crazy ideas that Kennedy couldn't stand.
As for the main character, who is clearly not mentally handicapped but seems to act like a five-year-old child in certain aspects, I wonder whether this is the reason for the performance or the requirements of the director.
And there is something else I don't understand. Why is韩寒 so enthused to add a crash scene in his own movie?
Such a film arrangement is in the Chinese New Year film festival, is it to block the audience?

The inspection well masonry brick machine is widely used for the new construction materials of underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity and gas.
For example: inspection wells, water tanks, drainage ditches, gutters, chemical tanks, and small structures, bridges wing walls.
The advantages of using concrete module to build the inspection well are that the module has a concave and convex structure on all four sides, and the combination of brick construction forms a chain lock.
The tensile strength of the wall of the well is far better than that of the friction brick.
The modules are hollow structures and the joints between the vertical holes and the horizontal holes are connected, and the vertical holes and the horizontal holes are connected. After the injection of the cores, the concrete network structure is formed, which plays a role of secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The modules are equipped with studs, and the vertical studs and the horizontal studs are increased in strength accordingly.
The inspection well and drainage well built with the concrete inspection井 module are less likely to collapse, sink, leak and other phenomena. The mechanical performance of the wall module of the inspection well and drainage well is stable, and the operation is simple. The forming size is standard.
The intelligent control system of the concrete inspection well module brick machine is equipped with a one-button touch screen LCD monitor to monitor the mechanical operation of the whole process, so as to realize ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of the raw materials, density operation, safety logical control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the wall module adopts a single cylinder hydraulic and conveying, and a double cylinder hydraulic and conveying.
An independent hydraulic integrated station, avoiding the impact of the main vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.

South African doctor: Omikran's impact is strong but most cases are mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the mutation of the COVID-19 virus are milder than those caused by Delta, although the speed of transmission is faster.
According to the report of the United States news agency, with the spread of the variant of Opimic戎 in South Africa, a doctor group of more than 5,000 doctors in Houten, South Africa, reported that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they treat at present are relatively mild, such as body pain and coughing, which are similar to the symptoms of the flu.
Dr Unben Pillay, director of the organization, said he saw dozens of patients every day, but no patients needed hospitalization.
皮莱说 ： “他们能够在家里控制疾病 ， 大多数人在隔离 10 至 14 天内康复。 ”
He said this included elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to fall into a critical condition due to the coronavirus infection.
He said that compared with the first wave of the Delta epidemic, the patients he treated were "suffering from difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen level."
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days."
Two weeks after the first report of the emergence of the Ominkine variant virus in South Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although collecting enough data takes several weeks, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the summary by the National Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease of South Africa: Only 30% of the coronavirus patients who were hospitalized in recent weeks were suffering from severe symptoms, which was half of the proportion of severe symptoms in the first wave of the pandemic; the average length of hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent coronavirus patients died, while the death rate in the early outbreak of South Africa was 20%.
William Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, cited data from the National Institute of Health and other reports as follows: "At present, almost all indications suggest that it is a mild disease. "
He added: “It's still early, we need late data.
In general, the time of hospitalization and death is later, and we entered this outbreak only two weeks ago. "
At the same time, scientists from all over the world are observing the number of cases and the inpatient rate, while testing the effectiveness of the current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the main new coronavirus variant in the world, the outbreak of Omikrog has occurred in dozens of countries, including South Africa as the epicenter of the epidemic.
According to the health officials, the new cases discovered in the first week of December increased by 400%, and the tests showed that the Omiyik variant accounted for more than 90% of the cases.

Education Commentary: What is needed to save the kidnapped children?
If the famous publicity slogan of "no trade without murder" is compared with, it will be found that in the good environment without the demand for "treating trafficking", the community self-management and the whole people's anti-trafficking will make the traffickers have no profit, risk and high cost, so that such crimes will not happen again and again.
Recently, the child missing information emergency release platform of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the公安部 was launched.
This is a platform for the establishment of an authority channel for the release of information on the disappearance of children and the timely return of the abducted children.
I heard that the app was called "Team Up", and I felt very warm.
New technologies not only have a name of "artistic" and full of emotion, but also use information technology appropriately and effectively.
The main goal of the trafficking law enforcement is to return the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Secondly, the trial and punishment of the suspects are secondary.
The meaning of criminal punishment can be summarized in many "big words" from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
However, before the trafficking case was solved, priority should be given to the victim's personal safety.
It is important to distinguish between the seriousness of the matter and the urgency of the rescue. Under the urgency of the "search and rescue" purpose, such as whether the "trafficking in children should be sentenced to death", such controversial and disputed issues can be temporarily put aside and discussed cautiously. However, the rescue of the child should not be delayed.
According to the experience of the investigation of such cases, human traffickers often move away from the crime scene after getting a success.
If the search and rescue operation takes one minute longer, the child may be further away from the parents, which will increase the difficulty of solving the case.
In this case, taking out such effective measures as "团圆" platform, which directly helps to solve the case and find the child, is indeed a pragmatic action.
In the end, “crack-down” is a huge task that needs to be done in the whole legal system.
To combat crime and safeguard the rights and interests of children and their parents, from the improvement of legislation to the guarantee of judicial justice, to the meticulous enforcement of law, it is necessary to implement the care for children and the weak.
In addition, the prevention of the trafficking of children can be done better from home to society.
For example, a common case, a family of three was sitting at the railway station for a rest. Their parents were sleeping and woke up to find that their child had disappeared.
It is not possible to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a young child’s parent, you should at least have some protection awareness.
Parents can take turns to rest or put their children in a safe place to prevent them from being taken.
From the other side of the crackdown on trafficking in human beings, it is also necessary to pay attention and punish the side that buys the kidnapped children.
The single illegal act often only part of a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the法定 penalty for the crime of child trafficking is 5 years; the penalty may be death if the crime is particularly serious, and the property may be confiscated.
The penalty point is high and the maximum penalty is heavy. Under the trend of "lightening the penalty," the kidnapping of children is obviously a relatively heavy penalty.
There are still many cases of human trafficking every year.
It is obvious that some people have backward ideas on raising children and a weak legal consciousness.
The legal education of this group should be synchronized with it.
In order to effectively control the trafficking of criminals, it is not enough to rely on the strict enforcement of the official.
If the "market" for拐卖 exists widely, the traffickers will be interested in money, constantly innovate the methods of trafficking, and form a situation of "tactics with law enforcement officials." The trafficking action will inevitably fall into a low-efficiency pit.
Therefore, breaking the backward concept, popularizing legal knowledge, and also helping to solve the problem of trafficking and buying children’s crimes.
Yang Zhengdong delivered the essence of the Sixteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the provincial Party Conference at Ma Boxshan
From the 100-year struggle of the Party, we can draw inspiration

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: raw olive oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil). There are five grades.
Extra virgin olive oil or natural olive oil is obtained directly from the fresh olives by mechanical cold pressing, filtration and other processing to remove impurities.
According to the acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin olive oil (Extra Virgin): Extra Virgin olive oil is the highest level, the highest quality, and the pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a gentle fragrance of plants and a pH of less than 1%.
Premium virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): The acidity is slightly higher, but not more than 2%, and the taste is pure and aromatic.
Extra virgin olive oil (Extra Virgin): flavor and flavor are acceptable, the acidity is not more than 3.3%.
refined olive oil refers to refined olive oil, which is the refined olive oil after the initial refining of the refined olive oil with a pH value of more than 3.3%, or becomes "two oil".
refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Extra Virgin Olive Oil): Extra Virgin Olive Oil is refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of raw olive oil to temper the taste and color. Its acidity is less than 1.5% and is yellow gold in color.
refined olive impurities oil or refined olive pomace oil (refined olive pomace oil): It is obtained by dissolving the olive oil in water and then refining it.
You have probably noticed the importance of the acidity of olive oil in the classification.
You should know that the olives come from different vineyards and different olive varieties, so the quality of olive oil will be different.
The best growing conditions for olive oil:
The Mediterranean coastline has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for the growth of olive trees.
In addition to the Mediterranean coastline, other areas can only be planted sporadically.
Major production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc. are also similar to the climate. Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc. are also far away from the equator.
The harvest month of olive oil:
In the three to six months from March to June, the olive tree flowers and bears fruit. In July to October, the fruit develops and matures. The fruit transitions from green to red, purple, and eventually turns black.
November to February is the fruit harvest season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Oil's nutritional content:
Oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, which include oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Oil is considered the most suitable oil for human nutrition by far.
The summit ended, Biden said that the flame of freedom will never die.
The online "民主峰会" ( Summit for Democracy) convened by the US President Biden and attended by leaders of governments and citizens and the private sector ended on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom was burning in the hearts of all people around the world, and the專制政權 would never be able to put it out.
He also said that he planned to hold the second Global “Democracy Summit” next year.
The Taiwan government representative and member of the Legislative Council,唐凤 and the Hong Kong activist for democracy and human rights currently in exile, Chou Zhenghe, also spoke at the summit the following day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work that is before us is.
But we also know that we can meet challenges because I have said before that like this summit, the world of democracy is everywhere.
The專制政權永遠無法熄滅自由的微火,它在全世界和世界各地人們的心中燃燒。
Biden also said that the defense of democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said, "As a leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the bar of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, and be more powerful to withstand authoritarian shock and buffer, as well as people who want to pursue power openly before the public interest. "
The theme of the "Democracy Summit" the second day was to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and fight against authoritarianism, and to counteract digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values.
This day falls on "Human Rights Day."
On the same day, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Guterres, also said in his opening speech that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially the challenges brought about by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "It is time to reaffirm the common values and positions and the resilience of democracy.
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving problems of inequality, combating corruption, updating social contracts, investing in high-quality education, and expanding opportunities for women.
This also requires resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including all the tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Hong Kong civil rights activist Law Chi-kwong delivered a keynote speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding the participants to keep an eye on the human rights situation of Hong Kong and other Chinese minority groups such as Uighur and Tibetan.
He said: "Over the long term, the world has always accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold China accountable.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use all our resources (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Luo Zhengchun also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't know (the threat of the Chinese Communist Party to our democratic values).
And that's the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason we must change. "
On the sidelines of the Round Table Discussion on "Challenging Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democracy Values," Taiwan's Minister of Civil Affairs,唐凤, released the "State Declaration," emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and totalitarianism.
He also shared how he used information transparency and building trust to fight the pandemic.
He said, "We have always stood firmly at the forefront of global anti-authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the pandemic, the authoritarian governments all over the world rationalized the violations of human rights for the sake of public health and collective interests. The global democracy showed signs of retrogression.
However, in Taiwan, we do not need to close the city to control the epidemic, and we can defeat the fake information without removing it. "
At the same time, the U.S. Department of Treasury announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries that had been found to commit serious violations of human rights, as well as investment restrictions on a Chinese company that had been found to use surveillance technology to help commit human rights violations.

I know.
But the restaurant didn't know why it was delaying the delivery time
I wanted #NUMBER#
Anyway, I didn't call
I won't eat
I will definitely complain
You can't get it, how come you didn't tell me sooner
Waiting so long
No, I haven't received the call

I want to cancel the order
Why don't you cancel
Hello, the restaurant chicken is alive
I want to try tennis, but I am afraid that I will not be able to continue, so I want to practice for a little bit at a similar price.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendship. If you cannot distinguish between the two, the normal situation of the expensive camera will be more friendly than that of the cheap camera, which is actually industrial garbage.
They are very weak in strength, and the ball hits the racket and vibrates very much. Hard balls cannot withstand it. High-quality players are very difficult to handle.
Their logic and subtext are - tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, you know you can't buy expensive, make a cheap toy to fool you, you play twice, you won't play again, so the camera is cheap, you don't feel pain.
Wait for you to be able to distinguish the good from the bad, so that you can improve, and come to me here to buy the expensive one. I will earn twice money.
It is suggested to pay the same price and buy a used better racket. Choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous. So the used racket is not expensive. The new racket is 500 and 600. The used racket is 200. What if you have a ten thousand yuan racket?
It's quite friendly to newbies, but after the newbie phase, it's useless. But most people, especially women, can't pass the newbie phase.
The delivery time has been repeatedly delayed
Can you help me follow up?
Delay
Thank you
So, in fact, I already have credit?
Next, do I need to order again? Was that one no longer important?

In fact, there are many requirements for girls with small bodies in terms of clothing.
Girls who are fat in their bodies should wear skirts that are not too short or too long. They should be about the same length as their knees and cover up the bulge in their hips.
If the skirt is too short, it will show the fat on the legs.
It will make you appear shorter and fatter.
If you wear out the upper, middle and lower sections, it will appear that you naturally grow taller, that is, different colors for the upper body, skirt and hose skirt, so that a slender feeling will appear.
In fact, many dark clothes are the staple of thin girls (this is the author's experience), dark colors are also a good way to cover up your body fat, and elegant black skirts are also the first choice of thin girls.
Wearing dark colors, especially black skirts, will make you appear thinner.
If your leg is very fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too much.
It should be more popular and not too bright in color.
In order to prevent people from paying attention to your legs and feet when you get fat.
For girls who are slightly fat, it is necessary to tell them the key to clothing combination.
Girls who are underweight should not wear tight skirts, and upper garments should not be too short or stuck in the skirt. This will make people feel uncomfortable. If your legs are thick, you can wear black ankle socks or grid socks (the kind with fine stripes), and choose soft-printed tulle dresses, which can be paired with a tucked-up shirt.
Of course, there are also some requirements for petite girls in terms of short skirts.
胖女孩穿短裙，应该选择与短裙颜色一致的上衣，这样会使你胖胖的身材增加高度的效果。
Short skirts paired with heels can make your legs appear longer, which is the most IN combination in the summer.
If you are fat on the top and thin on the legs, you can choose a dress that is elegant.
Not only can it conceal your belly, but also show your advantages.
Short skirt will make you look slimmer. It is suitable for girls who are fat. The shirt should be a little tight to form the layers.
Simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt,胖MM can also try.
Small girls can also wear fashionable clothes.
As long as you can master the rules of clothing combination, the little fat girls will also be the focus of attention.
After making changes in clothing combination, we should also do more exercises in life to get off the label of petite girls as early as possible.😄

Girl donates her life to her sister's cause: "I thought it would be better if I got a physical injury" - Xinhuanet
An 11-year-old girl stood in front of a big wooden board and wrote on the board, "The human meat target, 10 yuan for a shot."
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou Girl Giving Up Her 'Leap Target' To Help Her Sister" went viral on the朋友圈.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a big wooden board that is slightly taller than people. The board says, "Domestic meat target, 10 yuan for a bow and arrow." This shows that the arrow can be fired after the person pays.
The act sparked heated debate among netizens.
Last night, the person in charge of the Propaganda Department of the Pudong Sub-district Police Department of the杭州市公安局 confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police had confirmed that the girl had made such extreme actions because she was raising money for her sister, but such actions were not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
Girl arrested for street "arrow target" fundraiser
In the pictures circulating on the Internet, a girl with long hair stands at a large wooden board in the shape of the "o", on which black ink is written the words "people's flesh targets, 10 yuan for a shot". A wooden board written with her bank account and WeChat and Alipay accounts is in front of her.
The picture went viral after it was posted online.
Some netizens believed that this was a "ballistic begging", while many netizens sympathized with this.
We found the scene when we patrolled the square at about 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and the number of spectators had grown considerably.
In an interview with local media, a police officer at天水派出所 said that there were two girls who were selling on the spot. They were both in their 20s and looked young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who was doing the “human target” was crying and begging the路人 to play the game; another girl was helping to yell at the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia, and she needed the cost of the operation now, so please help.
We contacted the local police in貴州 to learn that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the person in charge of the Propaganda Department of the Pudong Sub-district Police Department of the杭州市公安局 told the Beijing News reporter that the girl’s name is Jia Yili. She is raising money for her sister Jia Yanhui.
However, due to the treatment still needs more than 30,000 costs, he couldn't think of a good way to raise funds, so he made such a behavior.
He said that during the whole process, two girls were targets and one girl was responsible for helping, but they were not involved in the whole process. No one shot arrows during the whole process, but some people watched and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After the police examined the arrows used by the security department, it was found that they were not under control.
The person in charge said that "it is not advocated to take such eye-catching fundraising methods".
After being warned by the police, she has left the police station.

What is the most popular in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, there was an article called "Quick! The Olympic Project Manager Can Impact the Gold" that was very popular. It mentioned that the project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects. No one else can do it: moving bricks, going out of town, working late is the daily life of the project managers. Calling the fire, taking the blame and apologizing are no problem.
An article that seemed a joke but also spoke to the daily hardships of the project managers, which represented the incapability of the current project management work.
And people working in the project management field are gradually choosing some actions to get rid of the difficulties in their work.
From the number of people applying for the PMP (international certification of project management professional qualification), it can be seen that more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the report on the development of China's project management in the 20th century (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the total number of applications for the PMP® had reached nearly 60 million, the number of people passing the PMP® certification had reached about 42 million, the number of people with valid certificates had reached about 30 million, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificates in the world.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMPs has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that simple copying of "the old experience" is no longer acceptable, and the瞬息万变的 working environment tells us that we must learn to do things on the shoulders of giants.
Is it true that passing the PMP will ensure smooth project management?
Many beginners in project management said that by studying relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the knowledge points of the ten fields and five process groups of project management, but they are still confused when they actually carry out project management work.
Many project managers often feedback the following questions: The management cognition is not adequate, relying on personal experience alone, having only theoretical knowledge of project management, and cannot practice; the lack of a systematic project management process system supports the work, cannot be implemented in the work, the project estimate is inaccurate, the control is poor, the project is dragged and delayed again and again; members are not clearly divided and the "old oil" in the team does not know how to deal with it. Cross-border assistance and communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, after more than ten years of focusing on product innovation and research and development management, many excellent enterprises have trained a large number of product managers, project managers and other key research and development personnel, and won honorary titles such as "The Demonstration Base for Training Research and Development Personnel of Chinese Enterprises".
The online course of "Research Development Project Manager Training Camp" This is a kind of online fragmented learning that combines a number of practical cases, tools and methods of research and development enterprises, helping you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of the project manager and take your own project management to the next level.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less investment to promote the training process of project managers, so as to bring about efficient operation results.
Without being able to speak, it is possible to first see how other students evaluate this course: This course not only consists of experts from China Media Capital (formerly Huawei R&D Management Team), but also combines the international advanced project management methodology with the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, so that students can convert the learning content into specific work after class.

The transaction amount of the national online payment business during this year's "11. 11" festival reached RMB157 billion, a new high compared with previous years.
The colorful multi-tiered discount voucher and the live shopping on the spot once again grabbed the attention of consumers, who were once again benefiting from this wave of consumerism. On the one hand, this wave of consumerism made people sigh that the national consumer power was getting stronger and stronger. On the other hand, it had to be more calm to think about the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer groups in contemporary China.
Just before the “12.12” holiday, China Credit Union Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “China Credit Union”) issued a call for rational consumption, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumer awareness and consumer habits, and refusing to be fooled by blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, which was 2.04 higher than in 2019.
Overall, the performance of China's residents on the level of financial consumption is better, but it also shows greater differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills. It needs to be further improved in terms of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and adolescents is relatively low. The “old and young” will still be the focus of continuous attention in financial education; the “China Youth Debt Report” released by尼尔森 and the “2019-2020 China Youth Consumer Report” released by CCTV财经 showed that the young generation has huge consumption potential. Credit consumption has become an important way of consumption upgrade. 86.6% of the young people are using credit products. Nearly half of the people do not accumulate debts. Although the overall trend of rational consumption is shown by the young generation, it is quite different from the “over-consumption” label that has been attached to them by the outside world. However, some young people do exist over-consumption, following the trend of consumption, and thus have created a huge financial pressure and debt risk. This has even led to social problems gradually increasing. Financial enterprises should be brave to bear social responsibilities and conduct positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, JCB has been committed to providing high-quality and thoughtful services to help the masses build their own happy lives, advocating for consumers to set up a good and correct consumption attitude, and actively responding to the call of the regulator to enhance consumer awareness, especially the rational consumption consciousness of young people.
In the past few years, JTC has carried out a variety of comprehensive and diversified activities to popularize financial knowledge for young people, including college students, and has also quietly influenced young people's consumption needs through cooperation with top domestic universities and other forms of creative practice contests, helping them establish rational consumption concepts, reasonable planning of consumption needs, and then help them accumulate life wealth.
On the eve of the Double 12, JCB reminded all friends of consumers to set up reasonable consumption awareness and the correct money concept, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid the consumption loan misconception, and avoid affecting personal credit and future economic life.
It is necessary to plan in advance and pay in time.
If it is late, the late record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have adverse effects on the economic life in the future such as buying a car or a house.
At the same time, while enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose legal institutions and channels and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have the business qualification.
In the future, JCB will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updating and evolving financial products to provide consumers with more in line with their needs and diverse services, continue to help the masses improve their financial knowledge level, and help consumers cultivate a rational consumption and moderately borrowing concept, and become a consumer finance partner that can be trusted for life.

Vietnamese People’s Daily Online - The Gulf Cooperation Council Responds to Common Challenges
The stopover of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman includes Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first time that the King of Saudi Arabia has visited Qatar since the blockade imposed by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies on Qatar in 2017, which led to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed comprehensive sanctions on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, while having close relations with Iran.
The diplomatic tension seriously affected the internal solidarity of the HKSAR and had a negative impact on the economy of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the陸海空路線通往卡塔爾。
This crisis was only resolved at the Summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council in January 2021, when all the Gulf countries signed a deal brokered by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors by the two countries.
Arabs of the Gulf have resolved differences to restore relations with Qatar from the need to unite to meet the interests of all countries and regional stability, aiming to deal with common challenges.
During the visit of Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct陸路通道 between two neighboring海湾 countries.
The 725-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel of citizens of the two countries and integrate the supply chain.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest 50 billion US dollars in Oman. Two countries signed 13 cooperation memorandums worth 30 billion US dollars.
The visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to the Gulf countries coincides with the negotiations between Iran and the major countries of the world on the JCPOA, an Iranian nuclear agreement condemned by the Gulf countries because it cannot be resolved on the Iranian missile issue.
All the Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and regarded Iran's nuclear program as a threat to regional security.
All the Gulf countries believe that without solving the Iran missile problem and taking action to contain Iran's activities in the region, it is deficient.
Faced with the failure of the nuclear negotiations between major countries and Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted direct negotiations.
Its aim is to stem the escalation of the tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that can slow down the economic growth of member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) will be the first summit of APEC countries since the controversy between some member countries and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-assess the contribution made by its diplomatic achievements in promoting the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, while proposing various measures to ensure that its member countries fully cooperate to deal with common challenges and make a contribution to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Good
It is said that the exhaust sound of the super sports car is the largest in the new mountainous area!
Our team brought this car to you this time, which is the dream of many men.
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini and the replacement model of Murcielago. Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price of the motorbike is nearly 200,000 Yuan, and the road tax is nearly 15,000 Yuan a year. What is the name of LP700?
With 700 horsepower, how fast can you imagine?
Okay, I don't know, the data says that the 0 to 100 km / h acceleration takes only 2.9 seconds, which is about the myvi of the average person reaches 30 km / h when the average person reaches 100 km / h.
The low profile body, the arrogant cutaway door, the huge exhaust pipes all around the car, and the 6.5 v12 engine that is unobstructed by glass, perfectly define the style of Lamborghini.
For the description of the car, you don't need to say much, just Google it yourself, and the author has compiled some explanations that may not be provided by Google!
It is too much attention, where everyone is looking, and it is not comfortable!
The 1km oil cost is around RM1 (car owners don't care)
Practice the position of stopping and going. Otherwise, it will be a bit awkward (as you can't climb out of the car and get stuck halfway).
The engine sound is too loud, and you will suddenly be deaf when you get out of the car. (But it's still fun)
The car is too big, and it will be very narrow and very afraid to be knocked by the neighbor's car when it is parked in the ordinary parking lot!
It's lonely because there are no competitors on the road (I told myself, not related to the owner, hahaha)
Please don't misunderstand. The supercar in this video is not for sale. Sorry!
If you want to shoot a video for your car, please contact us!
More unknown car information, The Car Guide / People's Car Journal
It involved a car worth a million dollars!
You may have heard of Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, while the price of the Porsche 911 is in the tens of millions.
Yesterday, millions of cars crashed into each other in just a few minutes: the Porsche 911 and the Lamborghini Chiron!
The result is right!
University spirit and the spirit of the times - Xinhuanet
The university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and values that have been accumulated over time in the development of a university. It is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to present, the spirit of university plays an important role in the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the establishment of the world's first modern university, the university has carried out a unique mission different from other social organizations. For universities in China, it emerged during the national crisis in the autumn, and its spirit has been deeply affected by traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocates the value concept of "rectifying the world with virtue and cultivating the country with learning" and the patriotism of "promoting education and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is increasingly obvious, and the competition for education, science and technology and talent in the global scope continues to intensify. As an important "供给侧", the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the introduction of the overall plan for the overall promotion of world-class universities and top disciplines provides a higher and more updated requirement for the development of universities.
How to make rapid progress in the world list of top universities in a short period of time, and how to accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having a certain gap, so as to achieve "弯道超车"?
In addition to the confidence in the firm goal, the confidence in the path, and the confidence in the ability, colleges and universities should also give full play to the three advantages: first, the advantage of being in a later stage, by continuously introducing overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-renowned universities, and achieving a significant improvement in academic level and the quality of education; second, the advantage of cultural inheritance, by inheriting the wisdom of the Chinese civilization for 5,000 years, by promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, and by consolidating strength, building a brand, and improving the image; third, the advantage of institutional strength, by giving full play to the advantages of socialism, strengthening the drive of the goal, gathering consensus and working together, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for the acceleration of the school to catch up with the world’s advanced level.
It is especially important to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university in one place. At the same time, all schools must show their individuality and characteristics while playing their advantages.
The distinctive features of the school should not only have Chinese characteristics that are common to China, but also reflect the unique target定位, educational tradition and resource禀赋 of each school.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we will emphasize on the following three aspects in our education: Firstly, we will emphasize on the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents. Secondly, we will promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system. Thirdly, we will actively cultivate the cross-disciplinary emerging fields and outstanding cross-disciplinary achievements.
In the process, especially, it is important to always adhere to the spirit of university, and let the spirit of university and the spirit of the times resonate.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of "Study Innovation," the common value of "勤学,修德,明辨,笃实," and the common vision of "海纳江河,启真厚德,开物前民,树我邦国" jointly constitute the latest expression system of Zhejiang University's spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct teaching direction and continuously accumulate cultural height and consolidate the spirit. It is rich in content and profound in significance.
Among them, "Hai Nanjiang" emphasizes the spirit of openness and tolerance, which reflects the spirit of "using talents in the world for my own use", and manifests the good concept of absorbing high-quality educational concepts from world-renowned universities. "The true virtue and great deed" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and perfection, which means that universities should not only seek truths but also educate virtue and cultivate character. "The opening of the people before the people" emphasizes the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the need for new knowledge and the innovation of scientific research, as well as the need for reform and development and the renovation and change. "The building of the country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always be associated with the national destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
An intelligent person listens to what is silent, and a bright person sees what is invisible.
China’s colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, grasp the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction into a world-class university.
At the same time, we must uphold humanism and independence and let the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the national spirit stir each other, so as to provide endless power for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation as well as the common ideal of mankind.

At the moment when NFT is rapidly spreading, a new concept has emerged in the cryptocurrency community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" generated huge influence in Southeast Asia. Some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic started to earn stable income in this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet cultivation game based on blockchain technology, which combines various game modes such as NFT. It is currently the largest NFT project with a transaction value of more than $30 billion.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily income exceeded US $2.8 million, reaching the same as "King of Fighters".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded 100 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" will send a new "palytoearn" model to more people. Through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players will no longer be a single role. In addition to enjoying the fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This main body is not granted by the game maker, but by the blockchain technology.
I got a news about a friend's stock price and the biggest feeling I got was the choice of the enterprise in the race, that is, the choice of the investment target industry. First, the enterprise should choose an industry with a large growth potential, at least 1 trillion market size. Second, the enterprise should choose an industry with a good growth potential in the future, considering the growth potential of the industry after 3 to 5 years. Finally, the enterprise should choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and the slope refers to the competition pattern of the industry.
Cheering on the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the strategy of 2022.
The strategy is to "do the things right", that is, to do the things right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing", that is, to do the right thing.
The strategic goal is to find direction, while the tactical goal is to land, and there is space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, how to increase customer numbers (tactical thinking) above, can think about the continuation of the current field or the extension of the horizontal field (strategic thinking); for example, how to improve customer retention rate (tactical thinking) above, can think about how to improve core customers and high-value customers's retention rate (strategic thinking); how to increase activity participation (tactical thinking) above, can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the correct activity goal, such as increasing target customer participation, activating high-value silent customers, and precise new customers.
Thirteen years after its birth, Bitcoin has seen several landmark events in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador declared Bitcoin as the legal currency. This is the first time that Bitcoin has become the legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years, and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the expansion of the cryptocurrency investment gap for the second time.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot," which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden on transactions through changing the data structure of the block.

Asian American group complains about discrimination at three Ivy League universities including Yale - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, D.C., May 23 (reporter Xu Yimei) - A group of more than 130 Asian American organizations submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the US Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting that three Ivy League universities — — Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College discriminated against Asian students during the enrollment process.
The Asian Educational Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The head of the group, Zhao Yuzhen, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of applicants qualified for US top universities has increased by a hundredfold, but in the three US top universities, the proportion of Asian applicants has basically maintained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" of enrollment process, "long-term sustainability and systematic discrimination of Asian students."
Zhao Yuzhen said that the study of scholars such as Sanders in 2014 showed that among the three universities, the proportion of applicants among Asian applicants was the lowest.
The data from the US Department of Education also showed that among all Ivy League colleges and universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest proportion of admissions for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University had effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian students for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yuzhen told the reporter of Xinhua News Agency that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice would investigate and take measures to prevent these universities from discriminating against Asian students after the fact.
They also expect the complaint universities to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admissions policies for Asian students.
Currently, the three universities that have been complained about have not responded.
The Asian Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it complained about Harvard University's admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to the American Chinese group, which participated in the grievance, there were also American Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani educational groups.

On September 9, 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Yimin Town, Zhanxiang County, Zhejiang Province. After numerous on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory building.
On December 12, Mr.陸先生就購買廠房的細節與房屋所有權人的家屬林某進行磋商後,於當天通過銀行轉賬轉賬20萬元作定金。
Lin signed as the payer on the receipt of the deposit of the land purchase contract, which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit is for the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled for the seller. The two parties agreed to sign the land purchase contract within a week."
However, after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on major contract terms such as the scope of the sale of the factory and the payment method, the contract for the sale of the house was not signed until too late.
Considering that neither side could reach a consensus on the contract content, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned 20,000 yuan as a deposit.
After carefully considering the house for a long time, the deposit was paid, the loan was ready, and only needed to sign the contract, but the seller did not sell it. This made Mr. Lu frustrated and angry.
To this end, Mr.陸先生將林某起訴至餘姚市人民法院。
The court found that the two sides could not finally sign a formal contract, and it was not reasonable to attribute the failure to the defendant, so the case should not apply the cautionary principle, and the defendant should not be held responsible for the double return of the cautionary.
After the trial, the plaintiff filed a appeal.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original verdict.
Lawyer reminds that during the transaction, it is necessary to pay attention to the necessary caution.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, you should take necessary cautious attention, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house has been occupied or not, etc., and make it clear in the contract about the specific time and place of delivery to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
On Friday, after the "民主峰会" ended, the spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a speech on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held a "leadership summit for the masses," which was to "use ideology as a line to politicize and weaponize democratic tools and weapons, while pretending to be democracy in the name of anti-democracy, and stir up discord and oppose the government."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value concepts on people and promoted "democratic reform", imposed unilateral sanctions, and策动"color revolution", which has caused devastating consequences.
Democracy has long been used by the United States as a "biggest weapon of mass destruction."
This summit is a Biden's action to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held via video conference, and the leaders of 111 countries invited to the meeting, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
Before the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for having problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States did not have the right to chair such a summit.
And there are also critics within and outside the United States, such as those who criticize the invited leaders, including some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as leaders in the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, who are suspected of not having the true intention of the Biden administration to organize the summit for democratic purposes but for geopolitical purposes.
New German Prime Minister Scholz also attended the video democratic summit
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday that "today's American democracy is sick and tired, with money politics, identity politics, party opposition, polarization of politics, social撕裂, ethnic conflict, and income and wealth polarization", and that the American democracy is based on capital.
U.S. President Biden said in his speech, "As a leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the bar of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, and be more powerful to withstand dictatorship and shock. And those who want to pursue power openly before the public interest."
He stressed that democracy is not a foregone conclusion, "we must constantly update it in every generation, in my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our era. "
Biden also said that the global democracy and human rights "are facing a continuous and troubling challenge. Democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The US side promised to carry out a one-year action after the democratic summit, including a 4.244 billion-dollar initiative to strengthen democracy worldwide and support independent media.
The United States hopes that all countries make specific public commitments before the 2022 physical democratic summit to improve their democratic system.
Biden said, "Let us all implement our commitments and report on our progress next year."
Okay, I only fear that he has sent the wrong address

What is the drinking method of red wine?
Every person's hobby is different. Some people like to collect, some people like to eat, of course, some people like to taste wine, and scotch whisky with a red label is one of the most popular scotch whiskies in various countries. And scotch whisky with a red label won the gold medal of the International Wine Competition.
Each bottle of red wine has its own unique flavor, but if you don't know how to taste it, what is the harm?
How to drink a red wine?
Here is a summary for you.
Red card whisky drinking:
Ginny's red card whisky is made from about 35 types of scotch whisky and has a rich aroma and traditional scotch whisky characteristics. The aroma is sweet and smoky.
The entrance is sweet and refreshing, with a slight grass and tobacco flavor.
The wine can be consumed directly with ice, or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red card whiskey enters China. In order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, red card whiskey + soda or Coke or Sprite or New奇士 has become a fashion that lasts for a long time.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing the acidic taste, can also bring people a sense of happiness in the visual sense. They can be added to the drinks to play a role in diluting the alcohol taste and changing the flavor.
Red card whiskey with sliced lemon and sugar (sugar can also be substituted) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The authentic red wine flavor is slightly sour, and the addition of sugar can neutralize the acidity. The lemon will add a fresh aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
These three are the best ways to drink scotch whisky, and everyone can try them as a reference, hoping that my introduction can help everyone.
Education thoughts: How to make college entrance examination fair for “scholars” and “scholars” - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou University of Technology wrote to the head of the school, expressing their confusion about the university examination and proposing to increase the difficulty of the examination, change the type of the examination and make the examination truly reflect the actual level of students.
In fact, for a long time, university exams have been a "hot" topic.
In the university campus, students come from all over the country and have different levels of ability and different degrees of learning.
For a group with such a diverse feature, there are different feelings to be expected.
Of course, if the test questions are monotonous and the repetition rate is high, the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause a completely different feeling.
Students who don't work hard may pass the examination in advance, but if they think of other ways, it may achieve half the effect.
As a result, there is a "monster situation" in which a "study gum" can pass the examination and even get a high score even though he or she does not invest in his or her studies; a "study genius" does not drop his or her classes, and his or her work and notes are all good, and his or her examination does not rise much.
It seems that the students of Lanzhou University of Science and Technology have no reason to complain about the problems in the university examination, and believe that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou University of Science and Technology.
From this perspective, I would like to give a thumbs-up to these three students who wrote to me.
In fact, people who have gone to college know that there are many phenomena such as studying hard, trying various ways to "borrow" exam questions from teachers, and seeking to enter the examination scope in order to get "practical guidance" before the examination. Even in the examination, taking little notes and seeking high-ranking teachers after the examination are not unusual.
In my opinion, in terms of evaluation of teaching quality, the more important is the comprehensive grasp of teachers in teaching and learning and the scientific命题 on this basis.
At the beginning of the undergraduate study, the specialty begins to be subdivided, and many specialty courses are dominated by basic knowledge.
It is undeniable that whether you fully master the basic knowledge points of a discipline is to be tested in university exams.
The basic knowledge of undergraduates is basically the basic theory and common sense of disciplines. From the point of view of knowledge, there is not much change, and it is basically fixed.
Just as a teacher said, "I studied the basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago, and it is still the focus now. "
But the knowledge points are basically the same, which does not mean the test type is single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, the examination is usually organized by the examination committee, and the examination is organized by the senior teachers of the disciplines, and the examination is also organized by the teachers of the discipline, so that the repetition of the examination can be partially overcome.
However, it is necessary to prepare a set of test questions in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, which is difficult and easy according to the overall situation of students' learning, and it is necessary to comprehensively analyze the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the level of students' learning, so that the命题 of the examination can have dynamic grasp of difficulty and type, which can not only highlight the examination of the basic knowledge, but also take into account the examination of the ability, and at the same time innovate the type of the examination.
The examination is the guillotine of university education. What kind of examination has a student, there is a corresponding preparation plan. In the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The recommendation letter of students is highly valued by the蘭州交大, and a plan for rectification has been deployed throughout the school.
It is required that all teaching units organize teachers to carry out seminars and compare and analyze the end of the course examination, and formulate the命题 of the examination and the related system, while strengthening the supervision and inspection of the examination and the examination of the examination of the various stages of the course teaching.
From the perspective of university examinations, the solution to problems such as the single type of questions and the repetition of questions is to face the problem of the single type of questions and the repetition of questions. However, it is necessary to implement the corresponding system. However, it is necessary to implement the corresponding system, but it is necessary to do a good job in daily life. It is necessary to do a good job in daily life. Teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of teaching conditions. They need to have a comprehensive grasp of students' learning conditions. They need to have a comprehensive grasp of teaching conditions and a comprehensive grasp of students' learning conditions. They need to do a good job in daily life.

Jin夫人婚纱摄影(South Street Store) has not yet opened a branch
We were not able to schedule our time before because we did not have enough time. Lanni was very patient in helping us arrange our time.
Later, I chose a good weekend to shoot.
The staff members of the Queen’s staff, whether consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are outstanding.
That was my first formal makeup, wow, I couldn't believe I would look so good one day, hahaha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) are super patient in makeup and makeup is also natural.
The scene was taken in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, it was a good day, and I did not feel very cold. At the time of the photo, the makeup artist was attentive to our clothes, headpieces, and did a little bit of work.
The photographer was very humorous, and he felt very happy every day after taking photos.
When choosing photos, because I saw many cases on the Internet, I did not want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we choose photos, really, we did not want to add photos at all, just 24 photos in the package, and none of them were added (I heard that my sister, who was married at the same time as me, added more than 7,000 yuan to the package, and I was shocked and afraid that I would choose too many photos).
Today, the photo was ready, and Lan Lan sent me. I saw two photos that I didn't like, and they immediately helped me retouch them.
Comparing the photos that my sister took before, I think our photos are really satisfactory. Simple and fresh, that's what I want.
I sincerely recommend that you go to Wutong Jin夫人拍婚纱照!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Ms. Jin is grateful for your sincere wishes for her happiness and prosperity. She looks forward to a bright future!

More than 3,200 newborn babies in Sabah do not have birth certificates due to shortage of customized anti-counterfeiting paper
(Yap 11 news) Sabah National Registration Bureau said that since the special anti-counterfeiting paper stock had run out, it had been unable to issue the birth certificate to the newborn baby since early October, and the affected number had reached 3,200.
However, the director of the Bureau, Kapellas, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have their information recorded in the system, and that the fake birth certificates will be issued when the counterfeit paper arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained that there had been a long period of reporting on the issue of printing newspapers in Sarawak for more than 10 months.
He said that the problems had appeared two months ago, and砂拉越 also faced the same problems.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers specialized in producing special counterfeit paper were affected by the epidemic, which delayed the arrival of the paper in China.
He explained that the fake newspapers used in Sabah were different from those used in other states, so they could not be borrowed by other states.
Ke魯阿米努斯 revealed that the latest batch of counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on June 6, and was then delivered to the printing company on August 8 for part of the printing work.
The agency will send a person to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, and return to Sabah immediately for the final stage of printing. It is estimated that the goods can be delivered to the applicants within 2 working days (December 20).
We will notify the applicant to go to the local分局 to receive the newspaper.
He added that Sarawak has issued 2,488 newspapers so far this year.
I waited until late at 7.
Is it coming soon?
I mean food
I waited on the opposite side of #PRS_ORG#
Okay, thank you. The restaurant said it was ready.

The people's livelihood will be guaranteed, the employment scale will continue to expand, and the incomes of residents will grow basically in sync with the growth of economic growth. The grain will be grown continuously for seven years, and the "18th consecutive豐收" will be achieved. The ecological civilization will be further promoted, and the carbon neutralization work will be coordinated, and the green low-carbon transformation will be steady, and the ecological environment
These achievements are the result of the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the result of the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping's socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and the result of the unremitting efforts of the entire party and the people of the country.

Chairman of the Bosnian Olympic Committee: I believe that China has the ability to host the Winter Olympics in a special period - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency,萨拉热窝, December 11 - The chairman of the Bosnian Olympic Committee, Covicic, said that Bosnia and Herzegovina is very eager to host the Beijing Winter Olympic Games. He believes that China has the ability to host the Winter Olympic Games in a special time.

At the meeting, Keyvcić actively appraised the relations between China and Poland and said that he had visited China at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, and he was impressed by China's excellent organization work. He believed that China was capable of organizing the Winter Olympics in a special period. Poland was very eager to attend the Beijing Winter Olympics. The Bosnian Olympic Committee was actively organizing for the meeting. Poland hoped that this opportunity would be used to carry out more extensive exchanges and cooperation in the field of sports with China.
季平 said that China and Poland have a special "athletic link".
The Winter Olympic Games in Sarajevo were successfully held in 1984, and just two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games will also be held. It will show the world a simple, safe and wonderful event.
China hopes to deepen exchanges and cooperation with Bosnia and Herzegovina in the preparation of winter sports events and the training of athletes.

The 48-hour nucleic acid test result was negative and the "buffer zone" was set up The State Council’s coordination mechanism for prevention and control of infectious diseases issued a regulation requiring strengthening of the epidemic prevention and control in port cities. - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporter董瑞丰、顾天成) The State Council Coordination Mechanism for Combating and Controlling the COVID-19 Infection issued a notice on strengthening the epidemic prevention and control work in port cities, requiring that people leaving port cities connected to land borders within 48 hours need to have negative nucleic acid test results within 48 hours, and at least one nucleic acid test should be conducted after the arrival of people leaving port cities.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the determination of the port cities of the provinces and regions and the announcement on March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that coastal cities with conditions can study the establishment of epidemic prevention zones in the district.
The relevant person in charge of the disease prevention and control bureau of the National Health Commission said that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local main economy. The two sides of the border people have frequent exchanges.
Implementing the differentiated management policy of division, from a single prevention and control line to two lines, it is expected to move the front of the epidemic, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and minimum social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local cluster outbreaks in China, which were all imported from the port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems in the timely monitoring and early warning of the epidemic, the implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk employees, the formalization of periodic核酸 tests, the lack of disinfection of various links in the cold chain, the lack of proper management of concentrated isolation facilities, and the lack of scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that from the improvement of the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, the improvement of the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, the implementation of border control measures, and other nine aspects to focus on speeding up the correction of the shortcomings and weaknesses of the epidemic prevention and control of port cities, unrelenting and scientific and precise to do epidemic prevention and control work, and weave a tight foreign prevention and control line.
The notice emphasizes that the cities at ports should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and民生保障 work in sync, publish and open the hotline for民生保障, regularly check the signs and symptoms of basic living materials supply and price, and solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems raised by the masses.
According to the notice, the coastal cities mentioned include open roads, waterways, air ports located in counties (prefectures, districts, prefectures, prefectures, prefectures) and cities (prefectures, prefectures, prefectures) as well as the capital city (prefecture, prefecture, prefecture, prefectures) and the capital city (prefecture, prefecture, prefectures) respectively, and the specific scope will be determined by the provinces (prefectures, prefectures) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and timely announced.

The truth about the US's 20-years of bloodshed on the oil rig video - Xinhuanet
(Video source: YouTube)
On the 11th of December, a micro documentary called "The杀戮机器" on the oil platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the US-led war in Afghanistan with the pretext of "targeting terrorism." Through the war, the US forcibly exported American democracy, 20 years of cruelty and cruelty, bloodthirstiness and indiscriminate killing, and committed various crimes against humanity.
The use of drones to attack hospitals and schools, distorting human nature and establishing a killing group.
For 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan.
The US military set up a "black prison" to apply various torture and humiliation to the "guilty".
More hatred was born among the Afghans for a series of crimes against humanity.
As the video says, the US "anti-terrorism" war "war against terrorism".
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan. It has brought only devastation and slaughter.
Watch the video, let's uncover the truth about the US using "terrorism" as a pretext to kill bloodily and the deception of American democracy!
I accidentally saw this article from the perspective of business and the perspective of preservation. Why this customer wants to help the logistics company in the customs area to pack, although the packaging is a deep processing, it is not in the business scope of the customs logistics company. Here, the text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many food manufacturers and met with many food production lines.
In fact, the raw materials for bagged and bottled milk are the same, and there is no difference.
So everyone will probably ask: Why is the bag's shelf life one year, and the can's shelf life two years or longer?
Or again: Why is the price of the sound and bag packaging so different?
In fact, many consumers or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different and the quality is better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone believes that the expensive is good.
There are also consumers who ate the food because of this attitude and said that the taste or smell was different afterward!
Now I would like to talk to you about the reason for the luxury of the hearing, where is it?
Why is the difference so big between the raw materials?
Because when the manufacturers price, most of them consider that if the bag price is too high, consumers will not be able to accept it, which means that the manufacturer's profit is low, or there is no profit. What does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have seen a big increase in the price of the packaging to ensure their profit space.
Therefore, most manufacturers are mainly promoting the hearing, not the bag.
And there are so many manufacturers who spend hundreds of millions of dollars every year, even tens of billions, for advertising. Where does that money come from?
Everyone knows.
With the development of society, the cost of marketing, such as the cost of promotional personnel in stores, the cost of display in stores, the cost of gifts for products, and the cost of advertising, is also increasing.
So all the manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and they are listening to the products, and the prices are also going up. Actually, this is the new product that comes out with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, their raw materials will not increase by more than 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands who use every means to promote their products, including linking up with doctors at hospitals, so that they can assist in the promotion of the products and get a profit of RMB 30 to RMB 80 per listen.
And China's relevant laws are absolutely not allowed to do such a method of operation. In fact, this is a way to deceive consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bags of formula milk in advance, so that they can save money and increase the formula milk's preservation and sealing. It has no effect on children.
And everyone should not think that the sound preservation period is longer than the bagged one. If the sound preservation period is the same as the bagged one after opening the package, it means that the bagged opening after opening is difficult to preserve, easy to be contaminated and spoiled.

Don't let people get scared at the start line - Xinhuanet
When you go to the book fair, you often feel the popularity of books on success.
Today's success books often promote the "optimal principle" - that is, to assume or imply that you can do it, and then tell you what to do.
That is to say, it suddenly bypassed the actually most important and fundamental part of "How to do it?"
For this reason, these books have a common feature - to work hard to the best of one's ability, or to quit all at once; or to be 100, or to be 0; or to go to Mount Tai, or to stay at home.
This "optimal principle" makes anyone who sees it admit that "it is absolutely correct", but 99% of the people will be scared to the front of the line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "with determination to make a 180-degree change of life," which is precisely the weakness of many people.
For those who adhere to the status quo, conform to the past, and refuse to change, you have to shout at his ear that "you want to change", which is undoubtedly a lie and a performance.
Most people will be hesitant to make the change in front of the word "change," will be reluctant to move forward, and will be difficult to make a decision; or they will make a "change" decision on impulse and take the first step boldly, but the good will not last for a long time, and they will be unable to continue for a long time.
Mr. Ma’s famous “The Coming of Tomorrow” monologue is the most accurate depiction of this “common human nature”.
The biggest problem with the "optimal principle" lies in the high threshold, which often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's capabilities and makes the majority of the people "hope on the door."
Maybe the "principle of the best second" is a possible way for more ordinary people to take a relatively successful path.
The core of the "次好原则" is to reduce the threshold - it encourages a theory of "winning by small defeats," that is, if you can't do 100, you can only do 1 - because 1 is always greater than 0. If you can't climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the little sand丘 at your door, because that is always better than stagnant.
In summary, the more you do, the better.
Because the threshold has been reduced drastically, more people are likely to achieve it, and the success probability will also increase.
The road to success just follows the principle of "less is more".
Overall, while the "best principle" superficially aims to motivate everyone to succeed, it can actually inspire a small number of people, and the "less good principle" can motivate more people and make as many people benefit as possible.

The total amount of aquaculture resources in Lake Turkana has increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxun) The reporter learned from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of青海省 that the latest monitoring results showed that the total reserves of Qinghai Lake naked eels increased by 0.71 million tons, reaching 10.85 million tons, which was more than 40 times more than that of the protection initial in 2002.
The naked鲤, commonly known as the "Tibetan fish" in Qinghai Lake, is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biodiversity of Qinghai Lake.
In the 1960s and 1970s, influenced by factors such as the large number of human killing and the deterioration of the aquatic environment for the breeding of naked鲤, the number of naked鲤 in Qinghai Lake was significantly reduced. In 2002, the resource potential of Qinghai Lake naked鲤 was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake naked鲤 was listed as endangered species in the Red List of Species of China.
From 2003 onwards, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of lakes and the cultivation of fish, prohibiting any entity, collective or individual from fishing naked trout in the main rivers and tributaries of Lake Qinghai and prohibiting the sale of naked trout and its products.
At the same time, through the continuous increase in measures such as artificial breeding release and the clearance of the main rivers entering the lake, as well as the design of a scientific and reasonable "passing channel", the resources of Qinghai Lake naked鲤 have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the <v>Agricultural and Rural Department</v> of the青海省, said that so far, more than 1.8 million fish have been released artificially in Lake Turkana, contributing more than 23 percent to the recovery of the fish resources in Lake Turkana.
The三江源地区 in青海 is an important ecological barrier and water source in China and even Asia. The Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone that controls the westward desertification.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the三江源 region and the watershed of the Qinghai Lake, as well as to protect aquatic wildlife and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, over the past few years, Qinghai has issued fishing prohibitions notices for the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake, and has built a comprehensive ban on fishing management system with one river and one lake.

I just saw an article about menstruation. It's too long.
普及男性科普知识。
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period at the age of 13 to 15, and stop menstruating at the age of 50.
After being healthy, it will be more regular to come once a month.
But it is not a regular pattern that can be accurately predicted. It takes about a week of preparation in advance. Sometimes luck is bad and it will also go wrong (suddenly it will go wrong a few days in advance).
The length of time, the blood loss, and the severity of cramps vary from person to person. Some people have cramps for three days, others for one week. Some people have little blood loss, while others have blood loss. Some people have no reaction, while others have severe pain. The cramps will change with time. No longer cramping does not mean that you will never have cramps.
The bleeding during menstruation cannot be controlled, and the bleeding for 24 hours can only be stopped by sucking on the tampon or tamponette to prevent the bleeding to clothes and chairs.
Diarrhea is mainly caused by the release of prostaglandins. At the beginning of the menstrual period, before the pain comes, you can effectively alleviate the pain of the month by eating ibuprofen. After the pain comes, eating nothing will not help.
Because of the increased blood flow in the uterus and the excessive release of prostanoids, it is easy to have diarrhea during the period.
If you suddenly have diarrhea, you will menstruate for two days.
It is better to change the sanitary pads twice or thrice per hour. Otherwise, it is easy to breed bacteria. In addition to the sleep time, the worst case is to change the sanitary pads 6 times a month for 7 days. That is, 42 sanitary pads. If you add the pre-prepared portions, there may be 50 sanitary pads. That is, not one sanitary pad is used.
(Here, the tampon need not be changed often, about five to six times a day, for up to eight hours)
The mood of women during menstruation may be more volatile, and the mood of women during ovulation may also be unstable because of changes in internal hormones. That's very unfortunate, and the body makes trouble for itself.
However, the official crime rate data shows that female control of emotions is still very high and will not use emotional problems to excuse themselves.
Not only does the blood flow, but the detached uterine mucosa.
After the menstrual period, the cervical mucous membrane is the thinnest, and then gradually thickens. This can be understood as that the uterus is a house, and that the mucous membrane is built every month (thickens) to prepare for guests. When the guests do not come, it is all demolished (the mucous membrane is demolished) next month to build a new house. This is all repeated.
The menstrual cycle is inconvenient. For decades, it is 24 hours of bleeding every month, which will cause abdominal pain and lower back pain. Who wants that?
However, a human can be born because his mother has her period. The period is to prepare you for a 10-month house when you come into the world. Everyone should thank their mother for having a regular and healthy period.
Previously, many things were suppressed for women, and it was said that they were dirty, shameful, and so on by society. But times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the preparation of the female body for the birth of life is disgusting, that it should not be said in public, the girls stood up and stop thinking like this, never experienced it, never understood it, and the men who have never experienced it, never understood it, and who are so ungrateful and uncaring, how dare they face their mothers, and how dare they want their children?
Finally, sisters try tampons, which are really effective.
Today is the winter solstice festival, and the mistake is disappointing.
I need to order another meal for the children.
I hope that the shop will check the quality on the busy day.
Is the foot bath causing a tingling sensation?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in foot therapy and health care. Today, the author of China Midea will answer this question in detail, hoping that it will help friends.
With people's enhanced health awareness, foot bath tubs are becoming more and more popular among consumers. There are a lot of foot bath tubs from RMB 100 to RMB 1000 on the market. This gives consumers a lot of choice space.
On the surface of relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, sales of health care appliances such as foot baths are hot, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there is a certain safety hazard.
It is too dangerous to soak in the water with electricity!
Mr. Li told the reporter that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday present. But when his father washed his feet, he felt that his feet were numb.
Mr. Li initially thought that the vibration function of the foot bath was the cause, but when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt a sense of numbness on his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen and it worked, but he was surprised to find that the bath tub water was actually charged.
Later, he contacted the merchants and the merchants were kind. Although he had taken out the foot bath tub, Mr. Li still felt uneasy.
Because he found that there is no clear industry regulation on the setting of the highest temperature, which is suitable for whom and for what materials, the foot bath has been popular for a long time.
However, in general, bath tubs will not have any electrical problems, but it is also possible that some products were not strictly tested when they were made.
Therefore, when buying, choose a portable foot bath.
Water and electricity are separated, there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can take the battery tester at any time.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opened - View Topics - Hunan Daily Online
Hunan Daily News, December 10 (all-media reporter Zhang Xuanwu, Hu Wuyi, photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Expo and promotion meeting was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center. The exhibition of tea industry, innovation of tea technology, promotion of tea culture, and acceleration of the goal of tens of billions of tea industry.
侯顺利, Deputy Director of the Council of the National Council of China for Supply and Demand Co-operation and Vice Governor of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand introduction at the opening ceremony: the source of Lake Red is in Neijiang, and the rise of red tea has injected new impetus into the "colorful Hunan tea."
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the ten billion yuan of Hunan tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "three Hunan, four water, five color tea."
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and the main tea classes such as green tea, black tea, and red tea have stepped up their efforts. The main production areas have promoted the integration of tea travel, and have led the farmers to increase their income.
The Feng Shui is changing, and the red tea is getting stronger.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after harvesting green tea, they would harvest red tea and black tea. The tea farmers would have income all year round. The output value of the tea farm would rise sharply.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of companies the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" brand, and Newar won the "Huolong River Origin".
At the Xi'an Red Tea Exhibition Hall, the Fujian tea merchants saw a high-altitude tea called "Ice Spring" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Jian, Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said that factors such as the current pandemic and so on affected the tea market to a certain extent, but from the standpoint of the tea exposition, the highlights were abundant.
The red tea of Neijiang has a bright red color, which embodies the connotation of the tea culture. The Hunan tea industry greets the new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be canceled?
I threw it away, because there was no place to park and he couldn't bring it up.
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through senses.
Metaphysics is the basic principle of philosophy and aims to explain the basic properties of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" is derived from the words "metaphysics" in the "Classics of the Qi" and "metaphysics" in the "Qi", which was translated by Japanese井上哲次郎 (明治时代) from metaphysics.
The theoretical branch includes ontology, natural philosophy, and its extension problems.
The ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real existence entities, and which nouns only represent a concept."
The metaphysical naturalism, which denies the existence of God.
Its basic idea is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Method Naturalism refers to the research method that does not mention God.
The philosophy of spirit is the branch of philosophy that studies the essence of consciousness and their relationship with the body (especially the brain).
The two views on the relationship between the soul and the body are the most important two views on the subject of "the relationship between the soul and the body."
Knowledge theory is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic thought and study of human moral life; in this context, ethics means all behaviors accepted by a group or a culture.
It is mainly divided into abstract ethics (abstractly researching ethical theory or the essence of criticism) and normative ethics (judging different ethical theories and giving moral suggestions for the correct or incorrect behavior).
It studies what kind of ethical behavior is appropriate for people to follow, applies ethics (the academic field that studies the application of ethical theories to actual life situations, including biological ethics, political ethics, etc.), and describes ethics (collects information on how people live, making a conclusion from what has been observed).
The examination of ethics is not from the anticipated theory, but from the actual moral agent (moral agent) who has made a real choice and been observed, which prompted all the moral factors in the decision, it studies the ethical concept held by social groups.
Ethics history includes Greek and Roman ethics, and medieval Christian ethics.
Part 1: The ethics of humanism, with Vala and Monty as representatives.
Part II: Religious reform ethics, with Calvin as a representative.
Part III: Political ethics, with Machiavelli and others as representatives, and modern ethics (17th-18th centuries, British experience ethics, representative persons: Hume and others, 17th-18th centuries, European rational ethics, representative persons: Spinoza and others, 18th century, French enlightenment ethics, representative persons: Voltaire and others, 18th-19th centuries, German academy ethics, representative persons: Kant and Hegel, 18th-19th centuries, British utilitarian ethics, representative persons: Bentham and Sir Isaac Newton, 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, representative persons: Spencer and Huxley, late 19th century, German neokant ethics, representative persons: L.K.C.M.E.
Logic is a field that studies "the principles and standards of effective deduction and proof."
Logic usually includes three parts: deduction, induction and deduction. It can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.
The aesthetics is the subject of the study of the essence of beauty and its significance.

丁子霖: To my friends.
I sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian aid during the past 30 years after my family members were killed, especially since I had made an appeal for humanitarian aid in my personal name to friends all over the world at the beginning of 1994.
Nowadays, most of the victims’ old parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up to be married and employed.
Your bravery helped us through the most difficult time.
At present, the coronavirus epidemic is raging around the world, and most of the donors have retired.
Therefore, I implore you to stop donating to the Mother Group of Tiananmen Square, a humanitarian aid project that should have a perfect conclusion.
I will always remember your kindness and believe that your noble deeds will be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way and ask your understanding!
Accept my sincere blessings.
陶业按： Allow me to introduce the history of the United States of America (US) and the Chinese Democratic Foundation (MCDF) in Minnesota for 32 years of humanitarian aid.
In the process of humanitarian assistance, the United States and the Chinese Democratic Foundation of Minnesotta are parallel organizations. The implementer of the project often crosses.

The aid was often not delivered to the six million people in a timely manner.
In 1994, after the suggestion of Ding teacher, a special group was set up to coordinate and manage the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "Fund for the Education of the Six Million Chinese Dead and Disappeared," which was implemented for 11 years. In 2009, after all the six million Chinese dead and disappeared graduated from universities, the MCDF set up the "Fund for the Relief of Extreme Circumstances of Poverty and Extreme Circumstances of Extreme Circumstances of Poverty of the Poverty and Extreme Circumstances of Poverty of the Six Million Chinese Dead and Disappeared."
The main funding for these projects comes from donations from campus and society during the April 6 student protests, from individual donations, and from the support of the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Prison Reform Research Foundation.
It has been 31 years since the victims of Tiananmen Square were finally given a donation from Hong Kong in the name of Tiananmen Square.
During this period, China Human Rights also independently carried out its humanitarian relief project.
We understand that Mr. Ding called for a halt to the donation to the Tiananmen Massacre on April 6 was in consideration of donors. We are all retired people, and our income is not as abundant as it was before. We sincerely thank Mr. Ding for his “Letter to Friends”.
We will respect their decision and terminate the project within two years and resume it in the event of need.
Thank you and respect to those who have been generous and risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid for years.

Thank you for the review. I originally said that the rejection of the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style. I didn't expect that the finished product is so beautiful.
Thank you for the recognition, your satisfaction will make us full of energy to continue to move forward. We will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great, and I strongly recommend it to all of my friends!
No matter from the reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography, and post-production, it is unbeatable.
The makeup artist is very sensitive and can match your style with makeup that is suitable for you. All the makeup is of high-end brands.
The teacher Liu Yang is even more impressive, the photography is quite professional.
The whole studio is very artistic, with two little cats playing together.
We are working in Beijing, and some good photo studios in Beijing need to wait half a year in advance. Some of my colleagues have been working in Beijing, and I have watched the final product and found it just so so.
I have been looking for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor. We think that this is also the short version of most people. Photographer Li Ge will take pictures and record the natural and beautiful moments.
化妆师, 摄影师, 后期设计, A fine team.
We were all amazed when we saw the whole thing.
She has recommended her friend to come, and her friend is also very happy to have seen the negative.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, and more people will find it and make it their own style, rather than being uniform.
Thank you so much to Feng Yan and敬玲 for their five-star reviews. Both Feng Yan and敬 Yan are very creative and innovative newcomers. We are the creative studio. We will do our best to do 100 percent and 200 percent if the customer likes. Thank you for meeting.
The sweet and caring assistant, the lively and outgoing photographer teacher, every member of the team is super nice, a wonderful experience, a difficult one, and the result is much better than I expected. Everyone worked hard. I appreciate all of you 😘😘
Thank you for your comments. Connected with you is a coincidence. From Hohhot to Qingdao, our trust is so many thousands of kilometers. I am so happy to meet you. Next time, I will come to Qingdao to play.

If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to take a training place. However, if you do not have this idea, it is better to learn yourself. In fact, the cost of training is very high. It takes 6 months to learn.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a good choice, especially for those who are weak in self-control and so on.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can choose to study on your own, but it will be more exhausting.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, it is necessary to check the strength of the teachers. If the teachers are not strong enough, the training institution is of little use. Of course, some new training institutions do not have strong teachers.
Secondly, before choosing, you should inquire about the training institution in advance. You should inquire about the students of the institution, because only the students of the institution know what the course is about.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer this question, because I don't have a certain introduction to your situation, and the study of this thing is closely related to your situation.
For example, the specialty, the age, the language that you want to study, and even in which city, these will also relate to your study or the industry you want to work in.
If you are a student and you have not graduated, or if you have graduated and you are a computer professional, I personally suggest that you learn by yourself if you have enough time. This is the least efficient and the most costly way. Now many offline and online training institutions are also quite good. However, it takes a lot of time and costs a lot of money. You need to focus training for 3 to 6 months.
However, if I said these cases, it would be convenient to learn by myself. Many online learning resources are free now, or you can go to b站 for many training resources. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me for free resources or detailed consultation.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but you can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then it is recommended to go to the training institutions to learn, so that the learning will not be very difficult, the teachers will explain in detail, there will be people who will solve the problems, and there will also be help in learning planning or supervision.
In addition, many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal promotion seats, and recommend them to the company after learning, so that the interview for employment can also save a lot of things.
These are some of my thoughts, for I do not know your situation, so I only give a brief introduction and do not give detailed information. If you have other questions, you can contact me at any time for communication and communication.
I said 1 o'clock, I saw it on the App
What is it?
I haven't said everything yet. What are you doing?
I, on the other hand, take on all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-mounted water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, faucets, stove tops, cooktops, refrigerators, and ovens, as well as window cleaning and glass cleaning.
Thank you for those who gave me a thumbs-up in the dark, for living hard to keep going
Life will not disappoint those who work hard. Follow me if you like, and thank those who give me a thumbs up.
Life is like this. People only look at the results, while we support each other through the process of facing life. In the face of life, besides being strong, we have to continue. There is no other choice but to move forward. We can turn back, but we cannot turn back.
Cleaning is a job, also a responsibility, and life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of care.
Although cleaning is the most dirty job we do, we will do it with the most serious attitude. We will clean every corner of the client's house cleanly. We will see the happy smile on the client's face and the big thumb upraised. All the hard work will pay off!
My daily work
Your requirements, my service.
Serving with care, cleaning with care, and keeping the beauty.
You care about details, so Feng Jia Home Care can help you do what I can, and serve your family.
Bao Wan's cleanliness is maintained, the tree family tree is planted, and the service is provided, and the cleanliness is at home.
Cleaning indoors and outdoors, my daily work
Although the crystal light is beautiful, it will become dim and dull if it is not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can the light shine. The same is true for life.
To succeed, you have to do it with your heart. To shape it into something exquisite, we are serious.
Give me a chance, and I will make you satisfied. Quality means everything. Because professionalism is worthy of trust. Your trust is what motivates me most!
The current industry is not easy to do!
But I always believe that with a serious attitude, enough perseverance, and enough efforts, I will be better than others at least. At least I will be better than sitting and complaining!"
The moment of the day is in the morning. All the good things start in the morning. Hope you will carry happiness, luck, health, and success to start a new day and keep a good mood all day. Good morning
When I was a child, happiness was something; when I grew up, it was a goal; when I became mature, it was a mentality; when I discovered that happiness was a mentality, it was happiness.
Be the most authentic and kindest self you can be, follow your heart, and you will not regret this life. In life, there is only one road and two treasures: good health and good mood. So live a beautiful life to the end!
In every stage of life, there will be different problems.
Many times, what stops you is not your ability, but your courage to face it.
Since we can't avoid it, let's face it.
You will be defeated by difficulties as you are afraid of them. If you dare to face them, the problem will be solved.
China and Saudi Arabia jointly organized the first Saudi Arabian Contemporary Art Exhibition - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency Riyadh, December 12 (reporter Wang Huiya and Hu Chong) - Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art two-year exhibition - Dali Contemporary Art Two-Year Exhibition, officially opened to the public in Dali JAX Art Zone in the west of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on December 11, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participating.
This biennial exhibition is jointly organized by the Foundation for the Saudi Riyadh Biennial Exhibition and the Chinese UCCA, and the Chinese UCCA, as the artistic director.
According to the organizing team, the theme of this two-year exhibition is "crossing the river with stones", metaphorically reflecting the reform strategies adopted during the economic transformation era, and also reflecting the current situation of Saudi society and culture.
This two-year biennial exhibition occupies nearly 12,000 square meters and spans six connected buildings. Six units are displayed in the exhibition hall: "Grasping the Rocks by the River", "Experimental Transmission of Tradition", "Thinking at the Margins", "Going to the Public", "Wonderful New World" and "Reflecting on the Ideal of Art".
Among them, the number of the works of 27 Saudi artists accounts for more than 40% of the total number of the exhibits. They include painting, installation art and performance art in various forms. The works of 12 Chinese artists also attracted much attention. Some artists used recycled materials creatively. For example, Xu Ping used waste materials to reconstruct a classic山水画 in the series of "The story behind the river and endless mountains" (2014).
Bailey, chief executive of the DiLiYi雙年展基金會, said that he hoped that this year's DiLiYi雙年展 would establish international dialogue, let the global audience have the opportunity to learn about the vigorous development of the cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interactive exchanges.
田霏宇说：“双年展的目标是双重的，既能让沙特阿拉伯当代艺术参与全球对话，也能让沙特阿拉伯观众融入当代艺术世界。 ”
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the two-year exhibition. Artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss cross-cultural exchanges and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinating and standardizing the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (reporter Lin Bingfeng): In order to continue to do a good job in supporting the employment of the poor and consolidating and expanding the achievements of the poverty eradication campaign, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote the management of public positions in rural areas in order to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, at present, Yunnan has developed 4.83 million village public welfare jobs, which are used to provide employment for rural disadvantaged groups such as the poor, and has played an important role in helping the poor to achieve employment income growth, consolidating the achievements of poverty eradication and effectively enhancing the capabilities of various public services in the countryside.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including the Ministry of Human Resources and Rural Development, the Ministry of Finance, etc. It mainly standardized the scope of the target group for recruiting public welfare positions at the grassroots level, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions.
In terms of staff development, the new regulations clearly stipulate that according to the principle of "setting up according to the need, appointing people according to the job, dynamically managing and controlling the total amount" and "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person, voluntarily public, unified management", etc.
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of advertisement, declaration, examination, publicity, appointment, on-the-job training and placement.
In addition, the new regulations also define the specific responsibilities of the departments of public welfare positions in rural areas, as well as the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for public welfare positions in rural areas, and stipulate that the development departments of public welfare positions in rural areas should purchase accident insurance for people working in public welfare positions; and that the relevant departments should periodically monitor the subsidy distribution of public welfare positions.

Hello
Can you cancel the order?
I order again
Is it cancelled?
Second, although the right wing has prosperous times in history, it is not long, so it is short because it is full of sunshine and sweat when you are prosperous; when you are prosperous, you want to be prosperous, and when you are under attack, you want to be attached.
But in fact, the right wing played a positive role in the process of social progress.
From the end of the definition of the truth standard of the end of the Maoist revolution, the development of economy, the improvement of technology and the promotion of political institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right-wing should not be negated.
Three. For me, although I am not completely in line with Li Weidong's some opinions, I care about his opinions and respect Li Weidong. Because he is serious, he is serious about China and the social problems in China.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-revolutionary revolution is inevitable, and revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, harm people's livelihood, and make political groups mixed.
Four. Change or improve China must have patience and a sense of responsibility for the country for the people. Politicization of the attempt to change or improve China is not right, but idiots.
Let's talk about it.
Left, in fact, is a bunch of time and political orphans.
If right-wing speech has a positive impact on society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing speech and analyze their thoughts in need, while left-wing speech will not have this effect, because what the left wants is what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Fifteen. I recently saw some friends argue with the foes while refuting the lunatics, which was quite impressive. I think it was unnecessary.
Don't try to talk to the traitor or the left brain, both of them are stubborn. They can't talk.
And don't try to prove that we are correct, nor try to let the foes and the lunatics admit that, why?
I tell my friends, when the traitor calls you five yuan, and when the lunatic calls you dog, it proves that our middle road is right!
Many people had ideals when they were young, but they forgot the ideals when they were old, or pursued ideals, but they became delusional.
And the ideals are getting farther and farther away, and even the young master of the dragon is becoming a monster.
I think that the words "right" and "left" mean restraint and freedom, respectively. China should be to the left from the historical and cultural genes.
On the one hand, the domestic right-wing freedom is concerned with efficiency and development, while the left is concerned with supervision and emphasizes fairness and security.
Nowadays, society generally hopes for more equity, but at the same time, China and the United States are at war, and it is certain that it will continue for many years.
Although I couldn't understand it, I just liked it
Nothing more to say, flowers are so kind.
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of the US against Huawei chips have not only brought Huawei into a unprecedented dilemma, but also caused a huge loss for "US-style" enterprises.
The United States has imposed a blockade on the Chinese chip industry, forcing its own enterprises and allies to close their eyes on the Chinese chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence will be that the global chip suppliers' orders and profits will be affected, causing the research and development investment of chip production enterprises to be reduced and the production capacity to be reduced, thus causing a global shortage of chip supply chains.
Nowadays, the shortage of chips has hit all major industries, such as the suspension of car production and the rise in the price of mobile phones, which have all suffered greatly.
In order to control the "chip" autonomy, more and more technology giant companies are beginning to move towards the path of "going out of the United States".
In order to牢牢掌握全球半导体控制权、牵制中国半导体行业的发展， the United States has recently taken a series of actions, including hosting the "芯片峰会" and inviting 64 major players to form a semiconductor alliance. In addition, the United States has allocated funds to support major American technology companies at home, such as Intel, which is a leading American technology company in the chip industry, to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona and open the chip assembly business to the outside world.
When most people thought that Intel's move would cause a certain impact on TSMC and be very likely to take away TSMC's "bag of food."
This is because Intel, as a major US technology giant in the semiconductor industry, has worked hard for decades and has a large number of talent and technical reserves. It is certain to rise quickly and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, the decision by Intel was disregarded by the founders of TSMC.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Kejiang spoke out of the box. He was not shy about expressing his dissatisfaction with Intel's investment in building a wafer plant.
Zhang Keqiang's disdain for Intel's entry into the wafer industry was because he was still耿耿于怀 about the enmity between Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the star of the US manufacturing industry. It was the leader of the world semiconductor industry.
In the 1980s, the world’s high-end semiconductor chips were controlled by a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by IDM, in which the chip was completed by one factory from design to packaging. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model makes some small enterprises unbearable, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs have to walk away from huge production line construction costs.
Under the influence of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show the phenomenon of division and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongjiang heard of a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there are companies specializing in design, it can be established a special factory for wafer manufacturing.
Not long afterwards, Zhang Zhongming's idea turned into reality, and TSMC was born.
Taiwan Semiconductor plans to focus on the single link of wafer processing, without design, and provide wafer manufacturing services.
At that time, the newly established Taiwan Semiconductor Industry was the pet of Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Kejiang has once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing of the chip industry, it was obviously arrogant and high-minded, and it refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Keqiang also believed that Intel was insulting the wafer processing service at that time.
I didn't expect that the major players in the semiconductor manufacturing service industry would now have to start the wafer manufacturing.
So, Zhang Kejiang thought that Intel's entry into the wafer manufacturing was very ironic.
At present, TSMC's market value has exceeded Intel.
In the face of the powerful attack of TSMC, Intel was also afraid to stick to its own ideas.
Nowadays, TSMC has been pushing towards the 3nm chip, while Intel is still stuck at the 14nm of 7 years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
Don't wait

Three hot topics were randomly selected: the Spring Festival of February 2, the rise of Lixing Friend, and the case of goods拉拉事件, and the diffusion of public opinion formed a peak, and then the "指数下降" (smooth curve) finally disappeared. If there were secondary public opinion, there would be a驼峰 again.
They look similar to the model shown on the Internet Information Office's official website.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hotspots were randomly selected from the same event, showing the "monolith", "slicing edge", and "dividing cliff."
The "monolith" refers to the human heating, which quickly climbs the hot list and attracts the attention of the public; the "slicker" refers to the periodic heating, which ensures the topic occupies the top of the hot list; the "valley" refers to the collective evacuation, which ensures that the hot list plays its "function" and goes to the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak heat of an event coincides with the trough of the other event, and the time is exact. It must be that the unified batch of watermen received the task and launched a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black publicity can be seen: dozens of hot keywords are on the list at the same time, what attracts attention, what is responsible for publicity, what provokes war, what moves the gaze, what affects cognition, what misleads judgment, what provokes emotion, what裹挟 decision, the professionalization of black hacking is carried out in batches and at nodes, and almost all elements of the publicity of the situation are taken into account.
Communication is a science, throwing away all subjective factors and only taking objective data, black public relations will also disappear.
Every time you pass by, you leave a trail. Let's dig up these trails together.

Mauritius and other countries discovered the first cases of infection with the Omiack strain of the virus - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 -- According to the reports of the foreign reporters of Xinhua News Agency, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have reported for the first time the cases of infection with the Omerich variant of the coronavirus.

After being isolated at the hospital, the two infected persons' nucleic acid test results turned out to be negative. They have now returned to their respective residences.
The Cyprus Health Ministry announced on October 10 that it had confirmed the first three cases of infection with the Ominkine strain of the disease.
The three people were students and came back from abroad earlier this month. They were all mild cases and were not admitted to hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the Opiming毒株, the government of Serbia constantly increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, all 12-year-old and older passengers entering the country by plane will have to pay for the test at the airport.
On the 10th day of the month, the Ministry of Health also announced that it would start to immunize children aged 5 to 11 years old with the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Qubiza Chimpinda, said on September 9 that the country had discovered the first three cases of Omiyek strain infection.
The country's health department sequenced the genomes of 12 positive samples of COVID-19 collected from November 9 to December 2, and discovered the three cases of infection.

Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#

I called and explained to your staff

Address: 156環城南路幸福家园12樓
I was introduced to it by a friend because of trust. I chose to see it because of my budget of 7,000.
He started a series of fraud from the store.
I came to the store for the first time to show them my floor plan. They didn't measure the house on the ground. They said that my 135 property can be done at 7,000 yuan. I looked at their materials and didn't know what brand they were.
Their second trick is that once you come to the store, they will drag you to sign the contract (and once you sign the contract, you will never be able to return the deposit, unless you have enough experience to fight with them in theory).
When I was hesitating whether or not to make a deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that you can get a discount of a certain amount today if you deposit the deposit.
This is a big hole. I was the example of being taken for a fool in my impulsive brain. I paid more than 1,000 yuan in advance.
He gave me a lot of questions, including 7,000 including water and electricity renovation, and no doors or kitchens in the bathroom, which are the main costs of the base.
In addition, their service charges are higher than those of other companies.
I lost faith in the company, and I didn't have anything to say when I was asked to sign the contract.
When I went to find them for a refund, they showed a lot of experience and a special team to deal with you.
Either way, it was the fault of the customer. They were completely innocent.
All kinds of excuses and many details, I don't want to say one by one, it is all tears, so don't choose them, because my friend's house is also not in good quality, and you will get various costs in the future.
Terrible, they are the original head decoration that used to deceive people, and now they are big beautiful, and they seem to have collapsed again.
So don't choose such a shameless company.
In the future, when choosing, you will know more by searching on the Internet.

Is there no other way? For example, changing address?
Okay, then don't cancel this conversation. If you don't refund me within 5 to 10 days, I will take action.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes.

There will be a great deal of celestial phenomena on the 14th - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (reporter Zhou Ruikang) - As the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the twin stars流星雨, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will come into a maximum on December 14. Friends of the meteor shower can observe it in the night of the next day.
Beijing天文爱好者安久于2018年12月13日拍摄到双子座流星雨。
Most of the meteor showers are composed of asteroids, but the parent body of the Double Sided Star Meteor shower is the asteroid 3200 Faeghan, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The double star流星雨 is also the second one that is not caused by comets.
Liu Jianpeng, a member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in天文科普, said that like a Christmas movie, the double zodiac流星雨 usually appears at the end of the year. "The release date" can be extended from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is famous for its large flow and stability. It is called the third biggest meteor shower in the Northern Hemisphere, together with the Cassiopeia meteor shower and the Pleiades meteor shower.
One notable feature of the Sagittarius A* Cluster流星雨 is that the meteorites are slow in speed, rich in color, and there are a lot of firecrackers, which is suitable for the beginner of astronomical photography.
Yu Jing, an amateur astronomer in Tianjin, captured the double zodiac meteor shower on December 13, 2020.
According to the astronomical forecast, the double zodiac流星雨 will arrive at its peak on the 14th and 15th of the month of December. At the peak, ZHR (in the ideal observational conditions, the radiation point is above the head) is 150.
The recommended index map of the Gemini流星雨.
Last year, the "beautiful plum blossoms," a double-polar meteor shower, left people with a deep impression, but this year's double-polar meteor shower will be affected by the moonlight, and the magnificence will be reduced a little.
The lunar phase on November 11 of the lunar calendar is a lunar gibbous phase. The bright moonlight will cause interference to the observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the latter part of the night. At that time, the radiation point of the Sagittarius constellation will also rise higher.
Fans of meteor showers can observe them in the afternoons after the moon sets, but be careful to stay warm. "
How can we observe more流星?
It is not advisable to observe in the city. You can choose an observation site with a high altitude, little light pollution, and a wide view of the north east direction in the suburbs or in the countryside. You can wait patiently until the moon is down to observe the moon.
It is necessary to bear in mind that the traffic of the Sagittarius A* Cluster is very large in all directions. It is not necessary to keep looking at the Sagittarius A* Cluster radiation point all the time.
If you are a fan of photography, it is better to choose a wide-angle and large aperture lens to shoot a colorful "falling star". When shooting, use a high ISO and the maximum aperture.
In terms of stability and continuity, a tripod, a spare battery and a shutter line are also indispensable. "
Xiao Peng reminded.
What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in the market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the subject means the LCD TV, and the difference between the market positioning of laser TV and LCD TV mainly lies in the following two points:
First, laser television is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of the LCD television, the laser television clearly focuses on the large-screen market, that is, the laser television itself is a product for large screens.
At present, the mainstream LCD television sizes are in the range of 55 inches to 65 inches, while the laser TV sizes are generally in the range of 75 inches to 100 inches, which fully meet the user's demand for large-screen televisions.
In recent years, the proportion of laser televisions in global shipments and sales has been increasing, and accounts for more than 60% of the overall television sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the prediction of Shenzhen Industry and Commerce Information Center, in 2020, the sales of laser televisions will increase by more than 140%, continuing to maintain high-speed growth.
The good results achieved in the large-screen market are mainly due to the excellent performance of laser televisions in terms of eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eye. Compared with the backlight source of the液晶 television, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects in natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute Shiji Laboratory and Beijing协和医院 ophthalmologists have conducted a strict comparison test of laser television and liquid crystal television in the presence of the same group of people, and obtained 144 test data.
The data confirms that the laser television has a very strong protective effect on the eyes, and even has a certain improvement in certain aspects.
At a time when the importance of vision health is increasingly recognized, laser televisions not only attract more and more users with their eye-catching advantages, but also open up another breakthrough in the television market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the downward trend of the LCD TV price, the current market price of the laser TV is generally above RMB 100,000. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price gradually increases.
Why is the laser TV so expensive?
It must be true.
Under the continuous development of light sources and technology, the laser television has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD and projection television.
With the super short焦距 projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is shorter than that of the traditional projection equipment. It can achieve 100-inch big-screen experience in a short distance. The space requirement is not so great. And the main body is small and occupies little space.
In terms of brightness, large brands of laser televisions can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
In addition, it has a lower calorific value and a smaller loss of equipment. The service life of television is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models also include many front-end technologies such as 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system and biological screen, which can bring users a more shocking visual and auditory experience.
It is not about the fake demand, but the product of the demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and investment and output ratio, the laser TV is not the dish of the audiovisual players. In order to balance the big screen and the viewing environment, it is possible to try. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. After weighing the pros and cons, one can make his own judgment. What is worrying is to believe in a single word.
To put it simply, the ultra-wide-angle near-focus projection machine--laser TV, in order to be close to the screen, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which is not in line with the optical optimal design.
In order to block part of the environmental light, the use of micro-structure Fresnel screen is very expensive, and the price of 80 inches is basically the same as that of 65 inches LCD.
And there is one more thing, I especially hate the manufacturers of projection equipment to use the argument of good for the eyes as the selling point. Please, the light on the screen of the projection equipment is the direct light for the eyes, and the light on the ceiling is not the light that the eyes can see, so they have to resort to the LCD television which is also a "flat direct light", and the ceiling of the television is not also illuminated?
Moreover, the projection screen is not made of mirror if it is not reflective.
The hot spot effect of the high gain screen (spot) was overlooked, and a large number of light rays were reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which was really uncomfortable.
The photo and visual aesthetic photography gallery selects the high-quality stores. There is no branch yet.
I added the微信预约日期, the sister put the available time arranged for me, and the reply was timely.
Before going, I looked at the store's photography work, more of which were outdoor weddings. The style of photography involved was very beautiful.
After arriving on the day, I talked to my sister and explained my thoughts. I was very patient and helped me try two styles of clothes that I was indecisive about. Finally, I decided to start makeup and hair styling. The photographer would set up some props before shooting, and would guide the action on various details.
However, I may not have communicated with you about the specific shooting ideas, so the style that I wanted to shoot was not what I got, but it was pretty 🙊🙊
After the photo is taken, the photographer will help choose the photos, exchange the style of post-processing, and feel quite careful.
The repaired film will take about half a month, waiting for the effect~
Second time lucky to win the photo-tasting霸王餐! Most of the clothes can be chosen for the photo.
Finally, I chose a black chiffon skirt to try different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about two hours. The makeup + shooting is the responsibility of the photographer. The photographer is the brother of the 95s. I feel a little awkward. I hope that in the future, I can give more suggestions on the shooting of action sequences. He is very talkative. The shooting process is very pleasant.
Best quality shops in the Visual Art and Photography Visual Art and Photography Photo Gallery
On the first page, let's also see Queenie.
I filled in the name and phone number before coming to the store, and then I chose the clothes. I got married in the wedding. I got married in the wedding. I got married three or four times. I got married three or four times.
The overall environment is good.
There are a lot of options for clothing.
There are about three makeup locations in the studio.
The service is very friendly and careful.
The hairstylist was very patient.
The photographer will also be very serious to teach you the movements.
If you don't like it, the photographer will also ask for a redo.
The experience may have been a little out of place. The original eyelid was split into three eyelids.
The eyebrows were also shaved, which was a bit awkward for someone who doesn't usually draw eyebrows.
The photo was given ten days ago, but I am not satisfied with the P-touch effect. I feel that the double eyeliner is still obvious.
Because it was not clear what style I wanted, I tried two sets. Finally, I chose black formal dress. The sister said that this set was similar to that of赫本复古风
After choosing the right clothes, I started to make my make-up and hair. The hairstylist and makeup artist sister were very patient in helping me make it. The results were very satisfactory.
After getting my make-up and hair done, I started taking pictures. The photographer was always directing me to pose. The process was very easy and harmonious.
After shooting, I carefully selected four of my favorite photos for retouching. The little brother said that I should be done within 15 minutes. I was very contented at the end of the day.
I've been without a response for three days... because your system can't identify my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card for payment every time
I have to pay the shipping fee now
Can I be exempted from paying my monthly fee?
Do you want to buy insurance for small umbrellas?
Small umbrella is an internet insurance broker platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the Guiding Opinions on the Supervision of Insurance Brokers (Revised in 2015), becoming an insurance broker must meet the following three keywords: shareholders, the发起人 must not have any major violations of the law in the last three years, and the minimum limit is RMB 5 million. It must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three actually are very strict. In summary, they must have strength, must be approved by the State Authorities of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIC), and the shareholders must have a good attitude. As a small umbrella insurance provided by the insurance agency, the insurer does not need to question too much whether the small umbrella insurance is legitimate or not. In the end, there are three thresholds, and not all insurance companies can reach them.
On this point, it is not bad, and it is trustworthy.
From the insurance product point of view: the umbrella insurance is a kind of insurance supermarket. Many companies' star life insurance policies are sold on this platform. For example, the and泰 Super Mario 5D life insurance, the indemnity party and the insurer are the same as the and泰 Life, and the umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so it does not need to question its reliability.
From the point of view of payment model: The products of the Internet platform are generally more cost-effective than those of the traditional brick-and-mortar stores, and the salaries of the business agents.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of professionalism: This is especially important, because insurance is a profession that requires a very high level of professionalism. Many Internet products can be insured by customers themselves. This will lead to many misconceptions. In terms of health warnings and employment, non-insurance personnel often add their own subjective consciousness, believing that they are healthy or qualified, which will lead to many potential liabilities. It is possible to be denied.
I myself have done insurance telephone sales in "Tencent Micro Insurance (TMI)", which is also an Internet insurance broker platform. I was very responsible to tell everyone.
Internet insurance is real and credible, but unreliable is people. Internet channels do not have professional employees, and there are many sales misconceptions.
For example, a one-unit insurance cost 600 million, a mobile phone insurance is offered, and a free life insurance limit of 6 million is given to those who buy insurance. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are overly simplistic. They will not tell the insurer that the first month is free, and the second month will be charged at normal rates. The range is from几十 to 200. Many customers are not clear of what they paid for for a few years.
I thought I could pay 1 yuan and the insurance company would pay 600 million (the world is falling off).
The free mobile phone is only delivered to the insurance number such as 66666 or 88888, which is a special insurance number in the end of the insurance policy, and if the SMS message is sent, you do not have to exchange it, and no one will remind you.
(This is another pitfall for the insurer) The free 6,000-yuan life insurance limit is temporary, if you only rely on it, there is no other business insurance, and if you really have a life-threatening disease, what will 6,000 do? It will not solve the problem, and you will start living naked.
At present, the misguided sales of Internet insurance are being vigorously combated by the state.
Therefore, from a comprehensive perspective, the platform is no problem, the product is no problem, and the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the agents.
The topic suggests that the topic suggests that the topic suggests that the topic suggests that in order to make a comprehensive and careful consideration, in fact, many offline insurance broker companies' products are more extensive, and the opportunities and products are more extensive, and some products are also more favorable than the Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers, insured offline products, and saved the premium of each person by 2,000-3,000 yuan/year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
Me: Mingya insurance agent, I have 3 years of experience in enterprise management training, served more than 1,000 enterprises users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies, and will personally design insurance products for customers from the perspective of customer needs before insurance, compare three companies for customers in the course of insurance, and try to win the best certification results for customers in the course of insurance, and organize the contract after insurance to make customers feel safe and secure.
Growing with each customer.
I hope my answer can help you!
According to the definition of the insurance supervision department, Internet insurance is a kind of insurance business in which the insurer can independently complete all the insurance processes after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, and the insurance adviser does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insurer autonomously.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance is not very "ceremony," even the printed paper contract is not available, it does not affect the effectiveness and legal validity of the electronic contract.
This kind of model, a bit like the "telephone sales" line of work, but there is also a fatal problem that comes with such a purchase: the follow-up service may not keep up with it.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "mediator" we choose is a "mediator" that can accompany us for many years and provide us with services many years later?

From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of smear and abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eradicate this villain.
Without looking at parties and factions, the first thing to be countered is this uncivilized attitude.
From the time you started asking me on Facebook to become friends to the time you tried to post the location of your so-called home and the name of your father on social media, I have been unresponsive.
After that, you not only continued to tag me on a daily basis, but also continued to discuss me with your so-called friends on Facebook in an undisguised manner. You could see the comments about my appearance, body shape, good maintenance, what to do on the bed with strawberries, and so on. I... also ignored it.
I didn't know that later, I received many friends to upload a picture of your Facebook friends and talk about your face.
I'm so sorry, as a woman, I can't continue to be silent.
After I reported the news to the police, you didn't stop at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are, or what status you are, in our society, respect for the sexes is required.
Yes, you can continue this kind of humorous, subtle, humiliating, insulting speech, or you can continue to say that you care and care about me, or you can continue to say that it's not harassment, or you can continue to deny that it's not your design, or you can continue to publish all the offensive speech.
No, I can't, and I can't even stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and figure don't need you to judge.
I even don't think any girl would want to give up her fame for fame.
My friend asked me, how are you?
I said so, and you won't believe it.
I think no one girl can still say that she is okay after such abuse.
Only those who have no basic ethics will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of man.
I cut some comments for you to argue
Your own post should have no one impersonating you
I can only say that you are a civilized enemy

2021 China International Rail Transportation and Equipment Manufacturing Talent Summit kicked off - Rolling News - Hunan Daily Online

This elevator is also very dumb. It's the same as having a big illness. Negative two to negative one. It's a waste of time. I can't go down to the first floor from the safety passage.

US Three航母集结中国周边，最强大武器罕见访问关岛 2022-01-17 多维 亲中共媒体 多维报道：中美关系的最新消息：最新卫星图像显示，美国三艘航空母舰正在中国周边集结；美媒还披露，美国海军的武器库中最强大的武器之一罕见访问关岛，这对印太地区的美国盟友和对手释放了重要信号。
According to the "Strategic Situation Awareness Platform for the South China Sea" of a Chinese think tank, on January 9, the satellite found a US carrier "Vinson" of the USS Carl Vinson near the巴拉巴克海峡.
The Strait of Palaki connects the South China Sea to the Strait of Sulu, and is a strategic location on the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected to deploy "Calvin" to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the F-35C fighter aircraft and the CMV-22 “Falcon” carrier transport aircraft on the “Calvin” carrier.
The US Navy’s aircraft carrier, which is currently moored upstream in the Pacific Ocean, besides the “Carl Vinson” carrier, there is the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, which left the United States on January 3.
The “Lincoln” also carried the F-35C aircraft squadron for the first time. The squadron belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Navy.
In addition to the two frigates, the US Navy is currently deploying in the Asia-Pacific region. The Ronald Reagan (USS) is docked in Yokohama, Japan.
The frigate battle group also includes the “Shaplan Lake” missile cruiser and the “Stark达尔” missile destroyer.
Three U.S. Navy aircraft carriers are assembled in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon has rarely visited the island of Okinawa in February 2022. On January 17, 2022, the "Strategic Situation Awareness Platform for the South China Sea" released the latest satellite images, showing that the US three aircraft carriers are assembled in the vicinity of China.

(Twitter @南海战略态势感知) According to a report by CNN on January 17, the most powerful weapon in the U.S. Navy’s arsenal rarely visited關島 last weekend.
The “內華達號”（USS Nevada）, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear bombs, entered the US關島海軍基地 on Saturday (January 15).
Three U.S. warships are assembled in the vicinity of the Chinese coast, and the most powerful weapon has rarely visited the island of Okinawa, which analysts say is sending a signal to the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first time that the US ballistic missile submarines have visited the islands since 2016, and it is the second time since the 1980s that it has publicly visited the islands.
Three U.S. warships are assembled in the vicinity of the Chinese coast, and the most powerful weapon has rarely visited關島 in recent years. China has built a large number of military facilities on the South China Sea islands in recent years.
The picture shows the island of Yongsheng in the South China Sea.
(Forum on the South China Sea) In the statement, the US Navy said that the俄亥俄-class nuclear submarine "Nevada号" visited the island of Guam this time strengthened the cooperation between the US and its regional allies and showed the US’s ability, flexibility, readiness, and commitment to the security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
Shielded ballistic missile submarines are commonly known as "boomer submarines".
The movements of 14 “Rainbow潜艇” in the US Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding the ballistic missile submarines made the “雷鸣潜艇” become the most important survival weapon of the “three unities”, including the launch井 ballistic missiles located in the United States, as well as B-2 and B-52, which can carry nuclear bombs.
When talking to friends about the recent fall of Meta by 26% and the disappearance of $2510 billion in value, Zuckerberg responded that "the competition is unprecedented." Why?
Meta (originally Facebook) is a real estate company. Its income mainly comes from advertising. Today, the advertising company that makes money is one that has a traffic channel.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc., whatever the functional positioning is, is a meta traffic channel.
In addition, Meta is also the largest “advertising alliance”. Many advertisements that are attached to Meta’s advertising platform are realized through Meta’s advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta can't get the data information of users again, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is friendly to users. It will be obvious to users whether an App can obtain its own information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
If Google does another stab, the impact on Meta's income will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in the growth of Meta's income has been weakened (the proportion of this factor is not certain, but it exists).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Meta receives at least 10% of its revenue every year from China, mainly from the contribution made by companies in China.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about a hundred people, and there are several distributors in the mainland.
Companies in China want to expand their overseas markets. Meta is a marketing channel that cannot be bypassed. The money spent on it is mostly spent on Meta.
Interestingly, the current TT is one of the main competitors of Meta, but Meta made a lot of money from the TT in the first two years.
All the local agents are helping Tencent to advertise there, and Meta's performance in China is also quite good.
I haven't been specifically looking into it recently, but it won't be better than it was before.
The stage of massive spending by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting old, and new platforms, including TT, are not under Meta's control.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only interested in income, but also in the future expectation.
Clearly, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "original universe".
The Yuan universe is indeed one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the Yuan universe is relatively long. This story is not enough to support Meta's market value in two to three years.
Therefore, in the next two years, Meta should be very difficult.
Although Facebook is now very prosperous, it earns US$100 billion to US$200 billion every year. In fact, Facebook is very concerned about the crisis. It has no good and safe walls.
Although his several social software's daily active users are relatively high now, they are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of rapid development of TikTok, Facebook has no confidence in it, and the disruption will happen within a blink of an eye.
And the concept of the Infinite Universe, which is both possible and unattainable, has no chance of success within a short time. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous, which is also why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and continued to search for new tracks. However, I think his track selection is wrong. It is a wrong path.
