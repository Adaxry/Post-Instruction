The goods cost under 20 euros.
The amount corresponds to 40% of the value test...
I am a #PRS_ORG# physical therapist and so far it is not a problem for me.
You should only need a number or a code to track the package so that it can be returned to you.
I have ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249 euros.
Today it costs 179 euros.
I found it very boring.
Should I cancel the order and resend it for a better price or is there another way to sign?
In fact, I also think that children should not have to take on the role of parents for their little siblings.
However, I find that it is also great to get in shape with the little ones.
As soon as you look, as soon as you help, as soon as the bottle comes etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are attached.
As long as she can still be self-sufficient, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is only working on it for a short time and it is OK for you, that's great.
You can best determine whether this is for your children.
It is not so that he should be climbing K2 and spending hours on the slopes.
It is likely to be fraught.
Perhaps the psychologist's statement also applies.
For if in fact something should happen, such as a fire, an earthquake, an alien invasion etc. it would actually be too much for K1 to worry about K2.
If this is now a risk you want to take, of course it's your responsibility;)
Help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire story, but I don't want to fall for the title any more. Maybe you know...
The story dealt with fear and this was to be treated.
At the beginning of the story, a thief kills himself by suffocating himself with flour and climbing up to his hiding place.
The case will be taken over by a commissioner after a short investigation by his therapists.
The commissioner has a small niche that also has fear (before the fire) and this therapist.
There are more self-medicating and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is assigned to go to the site of the self-medicating and to document and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it is ultimately up to this therapist to perform a type of underground therapy where the patient is implanted a chip in the brain and the patient is ultimately put to the extreme.
(A woman springs out of the window with determination to die)
This is described in the book as "the fight."
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic of the one who had a fire.
This is so the sharp hand I am sure the book was translated from a French author / author.
If anyone knows this action or even could give me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the password for Wlan.
You must contact your man first.
This can however take time.
What should I do next?
Is it possible to reverse the price difference?

Wegen Omikron: Johnson wants to ban smoking
New Omikron cases worry politicians and scientists in the UK.
This is why all those qualified adults in England should receive an income tax exemption.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to get even faster access to the coronavirus vaccines in the face of rising Covid numbers.
Every adult in England should receive the booster dose by the end of the year, Johnson said in a recorded video message to his country on Sunday evening.
So far, the date of payment has been set at the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to help kick-start the ambulance services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the context of the Omikron variant, however, the risk of infection must be increased, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be raised again with a third dose.
Now you can boast!" Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 more omikron cases were registered in Great Britain, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

I am sorry that everyone is using pronouns
I have a reservation.
He was invited to a conversation via email today.
I want to respond to the e-mail.
But the name is not "Peter", but something more complicated.
I have hugged him and, depending on where he/ she has a cultural background, it has been either a man or a woman.
**I don't know how I should write the e-mail now.
Can you please help me?
** I am an outsider and I do not want to be treated like a criminal.
Conclusion: everyone should use pronouns.
There are 5 books in total.
Four of them went.
Only this one I don't have today
Offensibly, the store had a not obvious shortage of goods.
How can a polystyrene damage after 9 months?
First on the #PRS_ORG#.
This is already working since ca.
Not 14 days.
So I have always bought the last books on the website and then read them on #PRS_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
But there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like to add 2 to the order and put it in the invoice.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help it.
Content warning: I will write a little about housework here.
I just have to write what the spirit writes.
I (21) often come from a professional background with victims (and perpetrators) of physical violence in contact.
There is a theme that really nags at me and I am afraid that many victims are not being helped or that we may not be able to help them.
I am absolutely clear that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my life that make me feel more comfortable than when I can't do anything about such situations.
I see the blue flecks, the blood, the tired eyes...
But even in conversation with four eyes, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing, I cannot all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of responsibility, fear of being able to enter this used social environment, fear of the children from this.
What I wanted to make all clear, at least to some extent, is that all can live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to take simple violence.
I often wish I could help in every case... I know that I can't.
But it will never happen.
Please think about it for a moment and realize that it is not worth the effort.

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick, he was in charge.
Again nothing: The second time within not more than three months lost the Riesen in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with the backdrop of the Pokal defeat at Merlins Crailsheim in October: "We still have some doubts."
After the game, however, she did not sit down - but again, in the context of the 61-72 (28-38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
For more than the nackled result, the style and manner of the transfer was discovered.
Statistically speaking, the three-quarters rule is a statistic that exposes the entire dilemma. The three-quarters quote is just 13 percent, 4 percent (all from young Johannes Patrick) for sage and write 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was delivered by John Patrick: "We were just not focused enough after the victory at Teneriffa and haven't implemented what we have been training for."
For example, the ball.
His opponent, Sebastian Gleim, reacted similarly: "A little game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like 10,000 people before."
There were only 750 visitors on Saturday at the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their cost.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team to victory.
The best player I've trained," praised Gleim.
While in Patricks team, the running back like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) struggled on the whole line.
Especially in the last quarter (22:15), the Riesen prevented a total collapse and came back to eight points after already 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
There is probably not much time left for hope.
Already on Wednesday (19 p.m.) the Riesen took the skyliners Frankfurt, before that also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We had another email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I already reported it a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all appeals against military service were rejected.
We have learned a bit more and have written them again.
We have already reported this to you half a year ago.
Always like from the egg: Max Raabe is 59
He amazes his audience with new interpretations of blows from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the program "Good Day, Loves Luck" - if he does it.
In fact, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig on Sunday.
So nothing happens.
The planned concert has been postponed in May 2022 - "on a subsidy basis" to combat the coronavirus.
Also other of his planned appearances will have to wait, as it is on the website of the singer today 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchestra.de).
From January, the artists want to collect their already 2020 finished works due to the pandemic.
Geboren am 12. Dezember 1962 in Nordrhein-Westfälischen Lünen, hat Max Raabe bereits als Jugendlicher viel und gern gesungen.
He studied opera singing in Berlin in 1986, and together with committees founded the palace orchestra.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire from punches and songs in the style of comedian harmonists.
He was sold at various prices.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged"-Reihe (2019) - exactly like his success album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013), the second place on the chart.
He has made it out of the mainstream.
Always elegant groomed, the blonde hair tightened back and adorned with a tag, is Max Raabe from the current German-speaking music scene not to be forgotten.
Since 2020, he has been on tour with the program "Guten Tag, Liebes Glück". dpa

Bundesministerin Klara Geywitz: There is no new housing due to completion
The new Federal Minister of the Interior, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the construction of new housing estates as it was demanded in Berlin in a popular vote.
In an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday), Geywitz said, "With a renovation, there is no single new home, only the interior structure changes."
My goal is to give my guests peace of mind that their rent will remain payable in the next few years.
One of the best ways to protect against a monopoly image is to have a diverse mix of providers, such as private landlords, developers or housing associations.
In Berlin, the SPD, Greens and Linkspartei will set up an expert commission to assess the result of the popular vote.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz is not going to talk to the FDP in the coalition about further tightening of the law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent subsidy until 2029, a reduction of rent increases in squeezed housing markets and the financing of the rent subsidy.
I will speak to the justice minister about this as soon as possible.
If the market does not collapse, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 tornado deaths in Kentucky
Numerous tornados have been generated by the US.
All alone in Kentucky could claim more than 100 deaths.
The pictures remind you of a war zone.
On Saturday night, in the US, several tornados were reported and possibly as many as a hundred people were killed.
The towers left a roughly 320-kilometer-long chain of smoke, especially in the state of Kentucky.
After visiting the disaster zone, Governor Andy Beshear said that everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just leave.
Parts of industrial plants, dächer are in the caves.
It is difficult to imagine that is actually possible.
He receives up to a hundred dead in the state of Kentucky alone, official figures continue to rise.
Hello, I just saw that she sold the #NAME# from the store.
This is very sad.
Would she still produce?
Or is she taken entirely out of the profession?
Is it possible to order this display in another country?

If the delivery does not happen in my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I think I can only order the decks now and send them to Germany in the warehouse?
I had returned an article and received a refund from the contact form, and I wanted to know if this was going to be processed or not, as I still have not received my payment.
Companies pay income tax and change tax rates
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a tax break, companies in Austria have taken on the initiative and offered their employees tax breaks.
This means that they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today are calling for financial aid for a loan.
Even the arrangement of verbal slogans to call for donations - according to the German image - should increase the willingness to donate.
He has moved to a company he has worked for.
This doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He has not been able to find his old place and has been searching for something else.
This can also be done.
And that he didn't find you that good at the time.
He didn't find his job too good.
There are many variables.
Give them a break.
That will then be legally relevant.

Help for the first campaign
Boron for the grill!
I am particularly happy for a group of four friends to take the tour over the bridge and I would like to drive my friends to a campaign written specifically for the players.
We played DSA 5.
The big boar has been made, the sheep and their motivation written, the individual acts examined and now I am writing about the first encounter with my own stream.
The premise is that the aid should be brought to a small village in the vicinity of the Thuran Sea.
The further action should take place there.
Some miles from the village, the help should be able to drive away a group of goblin and lock them in a hideout.
I want to give the players the opportunity to relax the confrontation on various facets: Over-zealous, manipulative, intimidating, the danger of early detection, which also happens to the players.
Group strength: Eight powerful goblin, two with spears, six with clubs and swords
The Gobblins chased the rescuers in a hole in the wall and flanked them to the left and right. The fire engine was stopped while two with spears stopped the fire engine.
If it comes to fighting and the help is under way, I have two solutions
(1) The helpers were found by the orphanage's son, a half-brother, and brought to him.
The crab is naturally dead.
If a defeat is unavoidable, the Halbelf with two of its knights will fight for help.
The Karren is still here.
How did she stop her Deus ex Machina from solving the problem 2?
Is the encounter as an escape too much?
The Goblins group will play another decisive role later, which is not only fun.
EDIT: wow, I had not received so many responses, especially not so many helpful suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee a lot of your ideas and now also more trust in my narrative.
I have built the lamp again.
And again hidden.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would like to send her back
Can you then let the lights come on, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I am contracted by Sky Sport F1
Hello F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has increased so much that I want to make a little noise with this post.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted midway in the F2- race to start the F1- reporting system punctually.
However, it was far behind the planned start and the startfall of the time plan, but we could still show the last ten minutes (planned) and the master's decision (!!) in spite of this.
Of course, it is so that F1 can profit from the right reasons and therefore must restrict everything else so that Sky DE can no longer have a vote here.
However, despite this, Sky UK has been able to take on the race.
Nevertheless, a small consolation: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has been well-prepared for the difficult situation.
Then, in F1, there was once again a rule-breaking commentator, Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, who did not know that under a red flag the race could be switched.
Although this situation has already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that Verstappen should be able to switch off the throttle when it was appropriate to do so on the subject of Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that this was a possibility for Verstappen.
I am the opinion that such elementary rules should be known when commenting on F1 at a pay TV provider.
It is not the first time that both have had standoffish differences on the subject of rules.
In general, it is not advisable to use the customized commentary style of Roos, but it is possible that this is the case.
But I really like Heiko Wasser from RTL.
Then come steady B&Bs, which are just as unprofessionally styled as the coffee table books by Peter Hardenacke or Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the last one brings a lot of stress in the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, the advertisement is just overhauled by Sky, in which Sky is the only broadcaster that goes to the advertisement, as can be seen from F1TV, which only has the German toner without commentary after the race.
ServusTV or ORF tun that.
These two networks also do less advertising than Sky, and as a free TV channel.
Of course, one must wear gloves and boots for their work, but this does not allow me to see the details along the way.
The original Sky Sport F1 program is also very durable and repeatable.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-language TV channel, which F1 overtakes.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races that they can still overtake.
So, anyway, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it could be with a regular TV channel.
I would be interested in your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# Pendelleuchte, Messing und mehrfarbige Glas x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it will be on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she will check an email and send it and she has never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on December 12.19.
One has already proven a defect after relatively short time (the product has a loch on the upper part of the stove).
I need support.
Lighthouse pumped up an aquarium in addition to sausage.
It is also possible to operate a filter system over the air.
This series will be offered in three variants.
Take a look at the table at the end of the show.
Here you can compare the performances.
If the pump is too weak, the whole system can be operated.
If you own a large aquarium, Pumpen with 2 or more exoskeletons, so you can close more exoskeletons.
The MK series has one, two or four accessories, depending on the model, but you can also set up an accent in the aquarium, for example with a light fixture (see us in the shop) or with a decor that changes the light bulbs in a fun way.
Here would be a marble, marble or similar.
The MK series has a special, adjustable construction and is suitable for use by inexperienced workers.
The installation is very simple.
The lace is attached to an anchor with a 4/6 mm hole... and can be removed.
The lighthouse should be the same, or higher than the Wasserspiegel and brought outdoors.
The shutters should sit lower than the water level, so that a backdraft vent could be set.
The jet will simply fly through the air and the vent.
This would prevent the water from flowing backwards, which the water is flowing through the pump...
If you want to blow the whistle in the open, so should you, as other whistleblowers, be covered and protected from fire
The pump of the MK series is a powerful package that barely consumes energy
Even if we give you the working time with 3 days, it will be packed and the packages will also be packed here every day.
All goes well wherever you go, it's very fast.
We just want to give a little encouragement so that no one is discouraged just because it took a little longer.
It would have been so, not everyone has sympathy for all the staff who also work in the running... of course here no Corona halt.
Please do not judge the package too harshly, just because it is delayed.
Of course, we are sad about this holiday, even if we are in the moment... they have done it hard
This is also very regional.
You are not alone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times to come.
How long does it take to sell the same with and without arms?
Can you also buy the beads in hell?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronauts' daughter and moderator to the world
The first American in the world, a TV moderator and four other passengers took a short flight into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the Blue Origin company of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the ten-minute flight were found in the west of the US state of Texas.
Among the brilliant blue sky, Bezos looked up at the newly returned astronauts from their return.
Welcome back," Bezos said in a blue room elevator, when he opened the Luke to the cape.
Among the applause from friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers hugged the founder of Amazon.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were guests at the company, which had charged the other four passengers for their tickets: room service executive Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not disclose.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley remembered the mission of her father.
He has worked hard in his studies and has to do everything himself.
She just screamed, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his delight.
He would like to return to All again, the moderator said.
New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometers high
The racket system "New Shepard" is completely automated.
The capsule, which had been separated from the Rakete during the flight, reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times with severe lactic acidosis, before the redundant object again landed on the ground from a great height.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the earth as a boundary to the world, but there is no international regulation on this.
It was already the third successful all-out flight by Blue Origin. In July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and a 18-year-old nephew.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was there, known for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin CEO Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of perpetuating the business with the Earth's tourism without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in chemistry or chemistry studies
I am currently studying Biochemistry in the first semester and I find the subject to be quite exciting and also quite intense in the laboratory (I have already had the organic chemistry practice behind me).
I have certainly already been informed about career prospects at the time of the study, but I also wanted to study for promotion and will do so.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, particularly concerning my job prospects.
On the one page (Studycheck etc) you hear super cheering and the cheering is total, on the other page you hear from unemployed biologists and even worse paid positions.
So I'd be interested in that:
(1) What is your current job?
(2) Do you feel satisfied with your work/residence?
(3) What did you study/ What did you learn?
(4) Do you want to do it all again?
Many thanks for your answers!
I am currently unsure and doubt that I will be able to complete my studies in 2022 and will have to take an apprenticeship.
If you have experience, write it down:)
Extra stress before holidays and weekend
This topic came to me last week.
But now I have to use my long weekend to relax.
For that, only now.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress at work.
As it seems, there are even more brunch days before the holidays.
It was so. Last week was Mariä Himmelfahrt, who is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses do a bridge day, which is semi-official.
Last week there was a long 4-day stay at home.
What went on last week?
Overall stress.
More e-mailed, still urgent, orders here, orders there, everything *immediately* before the long weekend.
Because... because?
Because "next week then" sounds so much longer and that doesn't sound right?
Or is it because people all want to go on a holiday this week so much as in a normal one?
Not only did I go out on Wednesday, but I also felt tired.
What should this self-confidence be for holidays?
Where do we have to celebrate when we can't give them what they deserve?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all so self-confident.
My question is simple: Are we only Swiss?
Is this our reformed evangelical art?
Or do you know it in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld enjoys Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is happy on Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she still has no gifts.
The actress and singer Hit Radio FFH said: "The beauty, even if it's not snowing in Erfurt, then you go to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Wald."
She will feel guilty when she cooks dinner with her son.
I love it," said Catterfeld.
But they still have a lot to learn: "The first time I didn't have any chocolates, I had to give them away now."

Still not working
DDR working model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was in action in Schlesien and Mitteldeutschland, the model locomotive ME Heft 11/1968, which is very rarely used, is seen in photos, the function is good, The E 95 locomotive is a severe diesel locomotive of the German Railways (DRG), which has been contracted to the Deutsche Bahn (DRG) for the operation of heavier coal trains in the Schlesian Netz, possibly also from the Kleinserienfirma ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are able to work on it
The Deutsche Railway Company had commissioned AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could power the 2,200-tonne coal locomotive and 530-tonne passenger locomotive at a speed of 45 km/h.
The speed limit was 65 km/h.
In March 1926, the DRG agreed to the delivery of the 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical parts, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical parts.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which numbered E 95 01-06.
All of them fought the Second World War and found themselves back in the territory of the late DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were commissioned as spare parts in the Soviet Union.
She stayed in Germany until November 1952.
All six locomotives were fixed in the state railway maintenance workshop in Dessau.
In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01, E 95 02, and E 95 03 were equipped with a stronger electrification of the middle German network, and in 1959, they were used for the heavy goods transport.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94 were first built in larger quantities.
For the first time since the E 94, it was not possible to increase the production number, the E 95 was put on the spotlight.
[4] The locomotives were initially stationed at the locomotive works in Leipzig.
They came to Halle P. in 1960.
They were used in a self-propelled plan to climb Kohlenzügen from the geothermal in Richtung Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated regulation of the locomotives becomes increasingly problematic.
So far, Schütze did not have to stay in hospital.
Then, the man on this locomotive who was constantly moving with a hammer and wood saw had to lift the wheel again during the journey.
Schäden an den Fahrmotoren kam öfters vor und führten zu Monatelangen Ausfällen bei der Lokomotive durch.
[5] Since the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives available and a clear shift away from electric power transmission was not planned at the time, the federal railway was able to use old locomotives and most of the splitter systems to put the E 95 out of service.
In addition, they said that Deutsche Rail's electric locomotives were only intended to be operated by one man, which would have caused a problem in power transmission due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the view equipment from the top management.
After mid-1969 the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn, followed by the E 95 01, which quit service on October 5, 1970.
The previously assigned new address 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives were evacuated until the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the museum locomotive E 77 10 at the Hauptbahnhof Halle.
It took a few more years before the authorities were able to convince those responsible at the state railways that the E 95 was a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first more extensive operation of the locomotive began with the goal of presenting it to a walking tour in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, she has been a non-working museum locomotive.
In 1986 the inner complete of the locomotive was completed.
The locomotive is being displayed at the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have worked on the production of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time to an exhibition at the Museum of Railway Arnstadt, where the transformer was checked and five locomotives were used.
-The locomotives were stationed on the Schleswig-Holstein railway until 1945, where they were used for the maintenance of the railway line and the surrounding countryside.
In February 1945 the machines were transported to the middle German network.
Haupteinsatzgebiet was initially Schlesien
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, a good function, opting for optical work in Eigenarbeit is necessary, installed, with a touch of play, a touch of taste!!!, a very rare Handicraft model, a very small opening, possibly from the Kleinserienfirma ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN

Yes, the F-elements are there
I have received a visa from the EU.
However, there were some problems.
The middle ball is held by two players. Unfortunately, these are too small and the ball cannot be mounted on the players.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bet.
The middle ball is held by two players, but these are often produced in poor quality.
The middle block does not pass through the blocked halter.
I also received new messages.
When will they be killed?
No flakes.
According to the montage director, they were just too bad
But that's exactly what it is.
The main reason is to fulfill their purpose
For me they are not flat
Could I get this translated?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a house fire in Oberbayern.
The police also announced on Sunday that a more serious damage had occurred in the six-digit Euro area.
The fire probably started from a garage on the outskirts of Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
According to the information, two residents were taken to hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not go out of their way to put out the fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has resumed the investigation.
But it comes much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To counter fake news - Biontech CEO published impf photo
Uğur Şahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first arrest at the beginning of 2021
Biontech boss Uğur Şahin had not publicly acknowledged his impending retirement.
Now the entrepreneur released a photo showing his Corona-impfung.
The illness of a friend led him to seek treatment, he shared.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Şahin has published a photo showing how he receives an infection against the coronavirus.
In social media there was false information that I was not invited.
In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the network "LinkedIn".
Since a few months, I have been waiting for my friends to post a photo of me, so I can pretend to laugh at these fake jokes.
So far, he has rejected this because the communication should not focus on him.
But a message in the past week has changed his mind: "I was most terrified when I realized that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The student and his family were not impressed, wrote Şahin.
He did not ask for the reasons.
However, "the most common reason seems to be fear, which is often transmitted through inaccurate information and misunderstandings."
Fear lashes out only with facts, sometimes it's better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the German broadcaster is published, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not impressed.
However, the video was recorded in December 2020, as well as the Deutsche Welle itself.
"Since it is not legal for me to get the fuel myself, I am not allowed to get it," said Şahin at the time.
In Germany there is a prioritization of the vaccination of the population.
Nowadays, the prioritisation has long been lifted - and the Biontech boss has allowed himself to be impaled three times.
Fire in a power plant: Ten thousand people without power
In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday night: no more power and, in many cases, no electricity.
There was a fire at a gas station.
After a fire with serious injuries in a fire station, thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to endure 24 hours without power.
Through the fire, the lichter came from 41,000 affected residents and residents.
The vendor Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous power outages had been reported until the late evening, finally being resolved at the end of the day.
Firefighters and volunteers from the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities are offering jobs in schools and are calling for volunteers.
The lender thanked those affected for their patience and those involved for their assistance.
We are very surprised that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We are also considering the affected communities, the district, the fire brigade and the THW for the unpleasant use," said the head of the fire department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take some time, as the Westnetz-mountain could only temporarily resume operation, he explained.
According to company data, a technical defect led to the fire.
Power is flowing again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out at 9.15 a.m. on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt power plant in Neunkirchen.
There is a need for reinforcements and repairs there.
Parallel to this, a connection to a 30,000 volt spindle was made.
With the help of these bypasses, the power supply is once again restored.
Since Saturday at 8 p.m. over 21,000 people had gathered in Much and Ruppichteroth for the second time.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen Seelscheid have been moved by 3.30pm.
Since 23.15, the power supply to the affected area has also been disconnected.
Over 80 Monteures from Westnetz and partners were deployed.
After the construction of a fire protection system for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for firefighters on Sunday.
After the meeting, Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) explained that it is now important for citizens and citizens to put themselves in their neighborhood and help local firefighters when needed.
The focus was on the residents of the old monasteries, in particular.
In addition, after receiving information from the authorities, temporary places have been set up in schools for those people who were not able to protect themselves and the independent medical equipment needed for medical treatment.
Good day!
However, the beds are sold in Germany.
Can I buy and pay in euros?
This is the daydream #PRS_ORG#.
I hope you have a beautiful day and stay healthy ♡
But I cannot mount it on the table.
It's a custom #NAME#.
There are 3 executions.
We wanted these with a table height of #NUMBER#
We have got 155cm height.
Today I received my #PRS_ORG#, but I cannot donate it to someone else and thus avoid it.
Can you please help me?
Otherwise I should have sent them back, because they are not wanted for the purpose.
I would love a refund
That's really easier!
Then we'll do it!
Would you like me to send you the receipt?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
I had not started the E-#PRS_ORG# before the purchase.
Should I do this now?
I have almost no memory of it.
So we're not surprised

Yes, we have both made and used the version 4.5...
It was possible that they had already suffered from problems
With my #PRS_ORG#, I have also bought a book.
If I could open it, I would!

I must also work!
To ensure that the dye is evenly and smoothly applied, you should rinse off the dye with clear water and blot it dry.
Before you bring the pin to the first time with a new color, it is advisable to take 2 to 3 stripes.
This can be done on the later invisible line of the baize or on a joghurt beaker.
The first line on the paper
Place the pins on the same line.
Lightening up the color shades later for a uniform area.
Use the pinsel to gently brush your teeth.
This leads to unrealistic areas.
A model is not a gartenzaun.
Start with the Greek colors.
The dark could have disappeared later.
Metalltöne and Metallicfarben come to the end with a separate pin.
Otherwise, it is possible to get a more beautiful metal selection if they mix with normal colors.
You have to leave the rest of the pieces one day before you buy them.
The models can be seen through the decals or the embossed images.
From royal insignia on aircraft to ship names and Zierleisten and Kennzeichen on automobile models: The decals give the model the last sip.
Bring the decals in the correct sequence, as long as the bricks are still good to get.
The cockpit of a plane allows for easier breathing before it is built into the fuselage.
The more important than the right tool is patience, understanding and a gentle hand.
For each snowflake you need a decal and write it right.
Decals are also called water spray pictures because you spray water on the reverse side of the paper until it dinks.
Then you take a small piece of paper from the paper and put it on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also noticed before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the paper from the model.
Attention: Always check if the picture is sitting correctly before you tear it up, so that it does not tear at the finger, knit or even tear.

Attention not for children under 3
I can only open a book briefly when I start reading something else, then I don't have to read the book again and I can download it again and search for the place where I read it.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Have I received this by email?
For all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 individual packages for me
However, many thanks!
Then I will buy it elsewhere.
But do I have a problem?
Kinderwunschbehandel bei PKV / What is a "Confidentiality"?
Hello everyone,
We were in child welfare for a while, now as it is about the payment with the PKV, this suddenly comes up.
The sequence:
We had applied for the children's vaccination at the PKV in the run-up to the vaccination and received the vaccination over 3 attempts.
The experiments were limited in scope (e.g. time frame, success, etc.)
The first attempt led directly to successful breeding and birth and was corrected with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and made 2 (successful) attempts to get the PKV.
We once again charged the costs of the PKV and received three further attempts.
After a few more attempts (we had more attempts than expected, and the most successful with the PKV), we tried the PKV and got the terrible surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2 + 3), the PKV only wanted to make 3 attempts.
The reason: With the Schwangerschaft/Geburt, the first two attempts of the first use failed.
The second child was a new insurance case.
However, according to AGB, "the insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when treatment is no longer necessary."
The experts in the round:
* Who has the right to the PKV (only 3 attempts) or we (we have 5 attempts)?
* Can the PKV point out to us that with a birth the further attempts will fail?
* Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance situation?
The infertility (due to blocked eggs) is not passed on to the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give you their opinion here.
Many thanks once again for your help!
Could you please let me know the three variants by email and tell me how I could find them the best again?
In order.
We will no longer buy them.
If they add my purchases from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost good sales.
They can continue to do so with their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the college told me that the refund had been made and now I have to send it back.
I may have nothing to do with the comforter being completely destroyed for me
Can you see what the college has written in the screenshot?
It is clear and obvious that the refund was made and I still have no refund for #PRS_ORG#
You can make your manager know that you have lost two stammkunden.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our home from his account.
We won't do that anymore.
No, the defect has only appeared after a few months.
A burostuhl must be used normally.
Otherwise, they cannot sell him as a burglar.
Unconditionally, the 24-month service is valid.
No, I can't do that.
I will be able to remove the skin and put it on the transplant company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products can be supplemented with additional hockern, but we unfortunately cannot find them for you.
Can you help them?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
What exactly is a low budget film? There is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little or no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can listen to low budget films on the net, like zB on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What do you do with that?
And what does it all mean?
Bin a very good customer from Euch, has already built two homes completely with their furniture.
Would you like to ask for the best price for the large bed?
The delivery was postponed once again, is this still possible?
Many thanks
With friends
If you don't have a phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing has changed at the Warteposition... then I will return soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
Halber Sieg" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive damage to the rights of migrants and refugees in Belarus," Bossong told the evangelical press service (epd).
After all, the EU has not stopped the confrontation, explained the Berlin-based research institute Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This state of affairs - Belarus is not quite small, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to go on for a while.
The approach to dealing with the people on the border is not in line with the European human rights convention, Bossong said.
Apparently, there is a "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Because the EU as a whole does not agree on the cost of the basic rights, this costs the EU.
This development also delayed the integration in the union.
She apparently can't get over the fact that a member state sets its own thing when it comes to doing it," as Poland, which does not even belong to the EU border protection agency Frontex, enjoys access to the border.
In addition, the EU has paid a further price for its foreign policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong added: A basic agreement on asylum policy will be concluded, as the line has been strengthened to "protect borders, borders, borders."
New attempt at the border crossing
According to Polish border guards, migrants have again tried to cross over to Belarus from Poland.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authorities said on Sunday.
Polish officials were attacked by the migrants with sticks during the incident.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, 52 attempted border crossings were recorded within 24 hours.
At the end of the day on Friday, a group of 28 migrants had already passed the border.
Tens of thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have overrun the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or are trying to do so.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko of being a Machthaber in Minsk, accusing him of having the prospect of going to the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have lifted border controls.
The EU banned Belarus and threatened airlines that brought migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, the EU Commission is trying to prevent the spread of the disease in migrant countries.
The most effective element of the EU reaction is the pressure on the flight lines, Bossong said.
′′ Since the EU has wrought its market power in the wake of the financial crisis and placed its closure under the microscope with tough border controls and extraterritorial sanctions to operate.
Minsk must also consider political costs.
The Belarussian society may not have been made aware that the security apparatus regularly escorted thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen may have broken two rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 Finale of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has applied for support.
The silver plates reflected the same two rule brakes in the last Grand Prix of the year.
The protest is focused on Max Verstappen's excessive speed in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he should have been careful.
A second appeal was filed against the value at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed.
Verstappen had overhauled Lewis Hamilton in Mercedes on the last lap and was excited about his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the drivers behind him drove dangerous vehicles.
I examine this.
I speak to the bank and file a complaint with you again
Thanks for the support

At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa Park, it was shown again how good the partnership is.
Shining fans to see, who have fun together on the Achterbahn, confirm this, says Europa Park owner Jürgen Mack.

I have already reported this to the EU customer contact number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it was before.

Tannen sales in Schönwolde: In the community of Krembz women search for the Christmas tree
Landowner Frank Diers has experienced such a curious situation at the tanning trade.
Once a man should even go home without his partner, because neither of them could make it.
He spends 2000 pieces each year.
The 56-year-old already experienced such a curious situation.
That makes it a bit more appetizing, he says.
And that with the guts??
But I am not a customer?!
However, I received a defective delivery and now I have to pay the full price.
Then I will also evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two best.
Both are from meat, which is grilled in a hot pit.
And both have their names.
In German, an equivalent to the "Dreher" could be found, which is not as easy to hear as it sounds.
Problems with Glasfaser + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new gas leak in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems with a stable WiFi network.
I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection previously and used Devolo DLan, which can handle up to a couple of outages at 50 Mbit.
The new fiber-optic cable connects the FritzBox 7590 to the DLan Modul, which is connected to the FritzBox.
However, on the other DLan Modul, which turns off the Wifi, not the whole 500, but I keep it in the house with the Modul, so less comes (also use a stack of doses, which removes 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms from the other Modul).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new glass fiber connection is now even slower than before (~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which seems to be a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similar losses.
Can you explain to me why so much Internet speed is lost through the power supply?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely helpful to have LAN cable in the house.
I am really happy that I have just created an extra account here.
That's why I would love to hear an answer.
When it is time to change the gear
Anyone who thought that now would be the time to relax on the Giro calendar is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm their fee hikes to their customers with all kinds of tricks, the freebates for negative interest rates continue.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, has a cap of 100,000 euros as relatively generous.
Now she has been halved and even paid wages for the day.
In a first step, the border was only for customers of the company's postal bank - at 50,000 euros for Giro and account services and 25,000 euros for day-to-day services.
But these lower borrowing costs are now available for the entire Deutsche Bank, a spokesman confirmed.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "old acquaintances with customers."
The commercial bank had already run a 50,000-euro limit before, which still applies, as did ING Germany.
The particularly cost-conscious customer, DKB, has increased its direct lending by two levels, initially to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
Nevertheless: More than 100 banks have now agreed to a loan of 25,000 euros or less after the Internet portal Verivox's figures.
The Sparda bank in Berlin has also come up for 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centre, which has even got to the German Supreme Court in the first instance, against this rule.
Now is being debated in the banks whether the Institute should collect possibly refunds - in the event that the upper levels also explain the negative interest rates at the core for unsustainable reasons and pay millions of bank customers back.

This is for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is full of climbing and hiking.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter."
For them, the success of the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of its series "The Morning Show" in 2021 is the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers are keeping an eye on her.
Still, so Aniston, she got a chip on the day (right, read correctly: a EINZIGE chip from the tube).
It is actually a miracle that she can lift the hearts of both female and male fans at the same time.
Maybe because she just got lucky with the love - and still wants the big one.
And the baby wish list has grown.
She was repeatedly asked when she will become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked me that have no idea what it is with me, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurt.
To hope that success and humility will also work.
Unwelcome end of a career: Räikkönen has to quit
Kimi Räikkönens still lags behind in the Formula 1 rankings.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne took off his hands and winked at the crowd.
That's what it was.
After a crash and a gentle band price, Räikkönen had to give up his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not much of the fuel economy.
It was his last and 349th Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport class.
He was also accompanied by his wife Minttu and the two children in the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the world championship in 2007 at Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix races, started 18 times from the pole and came to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich Holt wins 60th World Cup - Don't take it in the second bob - Sport
The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen's mark of 94 success is the goal of the bob pilot.
I have been through this already, I have to go for the season's first win of the season, then I can make it to Cortina in 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the Winterberg races.
He first defended himself on Saturday against the attack of Johannes Lochner, in which he pushed him three times.
Then he changed something on the material setting and pushed a bigger advance on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer(BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he set himself in front of the British Brad Hall.
The third was the Österreicher Benjamin Maier.
We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded, said Friedrich, who also celebrated his 22nd Serie victory.
The Stuttgart-bound Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner came to rank five this time.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race.
If I knew what he did, I'd do it too, Lochner said.
No medal with victory - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte, on her heimbahn, gave the third season's victory to the women.
After failing in the Monobob for the fourth place on the day before, she made it to the world cup final on Sunday with teammate Deborah Levi.
Zweierbob Olympian winner Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, in second place.
She booked the first place in this winter.
The Wiesbadenerin Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig at position three.
For me it was supercool, the first Podestplatz in the world cup, I am superhappy that Mariama took me.
I'm super excited about the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," Burghardt said and emphasized: "It is not just a climb, but there is also a lot to do."
Jamanka wondered a little about the not quite flawless drivers, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the docks in the warehouse and could now buy them!!!
What should I do?
I haven't even met him and so I can't even ask him.
Last year I had other problems and never had time for it.
And now he said he was released from prison.
Watch the chat about the Asare Sitzbank.
I would like to return it and then order again, because it is already reduced now:)
So will the delivery start on 16.3?
There was nothing of the kind on your website
No, only if I tip
He was taken away by his colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures from the wrong time.
But we would like to keep the regal modulator, even if it is not new
And not the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, until XY...
Hello lovely girls and women.
I have a few things I just want to write and maybe it's one - or the other...
I am 24, have PTBS, full-time student and dog owner - but I can see from the picture that my dog is actually 1 to 1 with my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, had a burn 2. grade on Monday and has been depressive (but now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel him, we have been shaken and it was beautiful.
I have accused him of this (weil Hand ist in Verband wg Verbrennung).
He is more relaxed and we see less of it now (1 - 2 x week) what I can do with my commitments and love.
My dog had diarrhea, I had fed him and now he is in his crate and has been so tired after I had fed him the wormleaf and stretched for him.
I live alone with my sister and mother, and that is exactly one month away.
Now we also have to deal with housework that we naturally share with others.
But cooking is just as much work for me...
My PTBS illness is completely under control, I am completely healed and coming right.
Not good, but I'm coming right and I'm almost symptom-free.
My uni is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow I will have a written test for which I have yet to make and an anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare.
And next week I had a medical examination on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no place left.
My week goes the same way: only until tomorrow, then it's holiday.
But then what happens?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so does this one.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need this mental jolt, because otherwise I pack it.
I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I don't feel that way...
Is it also?
Honestly, I am grateful that I don't have to work.
Rude and exhausting, that can I say.
You don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I believe that this has something to do with mental load for women and so I thought I should find here some kind of emotional support...
I hope you have a lovely evening, the week is almost over!
I have received my order today, but the whole other color is more expensive and the tablecloth has a print.
The first delivery was exactly as described on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we now take the table, will I get another color?
The email to cancel the payment was sent on December 26th.
Two times.
But she was not confirmed.
It was completely different: I had previously learned in school that many religious teachers did not believe in God and that it was only a further study for them.
For me, it always seemed strange, perhaps because I had been raised as a Christian and I had always believed in something.
How do you feel about this?
Maybe you can also work with colleagues or study together at different times.
In principle I see the difference between private and professional and it is easy to separate.
Yes, there is also a training plan.
But just imagine a physicist who doesn't believe in relativity.
What do you want to do when you don't believe?
What is culture?
The question is not private.
Can it not be changed?
This is very long, then I would see it
Good, thanks.
I had hoped for a reply by the end of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film Search Help
Hello people,
I search for a film from my childhood (24).
I think it was a film for young people.
In the film there are two time periods (or parallel periods).
To one the modern (real world).
For the other people (or the Reich of the Dead).
In the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the Reich of the Dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the Caribbean).
The paths diverge from one another and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Reich of Death brought by the dead woman in this Reich.
The transfer is also the station of the soldier.
At the end, both soldiers thought I was lying.
If that does say something, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has only slept on the couch for one week.
Fast forward: still alive: D
Enjoy yourself.
So a child has more than you think.
For this reason, it is important not to panic, not to smoke, not to drink too much, but to watch for a few minutes.
This makes you wonder!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattresses.
No cuts.
Achso and our had no sleep, but always a bed.
Help your child if it is running.
Is the head on the page?
Could it be from the bottom?
Or is the face directly in the mirror?
This allows you to check if everything is in order.
We are also all grown up and have come to be my husband to the world, it was Zb Gang and I heard that you put kids on the floor to sleep.
In addition, we have already sold "stock" to you and have already bought a lot of articles
But why are you only giving me 20 euros?
Hello, I have already written to you yesterday and have not received a reply yet.
It is about my necklace, which was stolen (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right shoulder blade does not pass through the scapula.
I would like to contact you as soon as possible.
The thief is currently not to be used.
To say it simply.
RBTV has asked for a lot.
And yes, I know that not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is just as simple as that the politicians of this party are now under all kinds of pressure.
Fast every format is booked (ok), but then go on a big tour at the same time.
It was said that you are a "non-independent" Internet provider.
Zitat Arno: You want to have "no endless bedtime stories."
What am I now?
An 0815 telephone number, who is trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marahs Do's & Don'ts.
Of course for everyone, apart from Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can help more people.
One Krogmann has completely lacked empathy and is trying to make a profit from the exploded roofs.
How should you find it all?
If it hurts, I find it painful.
I would like to thank Rueckruf for his help, as my holistic treatment failed.

As a Tröster bei Bauchweh or just a snack – My little warm friend is very versatile.
Kirschkern-kissen are a traditional staple food for warm weather, because kirschkern can be eaten and cooked again and again.
The naked inner parts can be warmed up in the microwave or in the back of the hand.
The bright company makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the small can feel comfortable even if it does not go as well as it should.
The Kirschkern Kissen with Bezug is specifically designed for the following application areas:
Before the kissing, check the type of the scent, the color of the stock or the color of the cloth.
Please take care of your health before going out!
In the micro-well at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (information from the micro-well manufacturer!)
Directly after the lift, the warmth spreads equally in the skirt!
Finally, the medicine should be returned.
In the initial warm-up, it can be done at the surface level, but this level gets lost in repeated applications.
You should always stay away from the corresponding heating method, as long as you can cause damage to your skin (heat sensitivity and irritation)!
Before heating the kissing in the microwave, check that the manufacturer's instructions allow for the use of muscle relaxants.
After heating up the inside of the kitten, check the temperature of the kiss on your arm (max. 43 °C)!
Do not use it for acute and chronic pain, epilepsy, frostbite, fresh wounds, blood clots and open wounds as well as for people suffering from severe pain.
For chronic high blood pressure, heart disease, venous insufficiency, diabetes or cancer, or for a swashbuckling dog, consult a doctor before applying.
If you open a bottle of wine and pour out the cork, worry about the product and the lost cork immediately and unconditionally for children.
If the product is used for babies under one year, the temperature of the child should be monitored during the application to prevent overheating!
All the measures taken in connection with the product are the responsibility of the manufacturer and the competent authority in which the user is not allowed to leave.
The product is transparent and at 30 ° C in the machine is clear.
Please watch the product!
In Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli takes in Düsseldorf
In Darmstadt, 98 can dream of the return to the football Bundesliga.
However, Hannover 96 is working from the table.
For Ingolstadt, it is also not under the third coach.
Jubel in Darmstadt after the late victory in Spitzenspiel, happiness in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful stand under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and ca. 3 years old) was no longer charged by my network.
This has been bought for about 5 months, so it should still work.
I thought that the network would also work.
Fehlanzeige, the battery is dead and the laptop no longer works despite being plugged in.
Then I broke the battery, but also here nothing happened.
Have you had your ideas?
There is a new battery, but how can I use the laptop on the Internet?
Is there anything else wrong?
Many thanks for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I buy this?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# booth.
We don't know how high the sitting area is.....
Is often on tour and still has a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
20 liter fassungsvermögen schlucken auch große Foto-Ausrüstungen ohne Probleme, die mit der gepolsterten FlexFold-Teiler sicher verstaut werden können.
And what else do you need on a daily basis, thanks to practical access to the individually configurable indoor space, and to the photo editing.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to the version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design has sparked innovation with the Everyday Backpack series - with Peak Design developing some of the most innovative solutions for protecting the interior of the rucksack while still allowing quick access to the photo equipment.
This works with two options: One way is to use conventionally sealed deckclaps that can be locked with the MagLatch closure system, a highly effective solution for effective protection that has already been tested in Messenger bags.
In the zipper pocket there is a zipper-shaken from metal with attached anchors on the front side of the rucksack.
In contrast to most rucksacks, the Peak Design has different "fillsternde": there are four anchor bolts, which can be secured with a screw.
Is the rucksack full loaded, just take the heaviest bag, is it lighter, a bit more.
Clamps and hooks are also magnetic.
This can also be locked securely without the key.
The second option also differentiates itself from everyday backpacks by other photographers, Fotorucksäcken: Besides the deckclap, there is also a zipper closure on both sides of the rucksack.
This eliminates the largest tailpiece with access from above - you don't have to feel it!
At the same time, this simple detail enhances the all-day comfort of the bag: if you don't just take your photo, but also all-day accessories or travel packs.
In the everyday backpack you can individually configure the interior space (more about this here) and so solve both problems together - and by the two openings also independently.
You can also take the backpack from the right side of the body, for example, to access the camera lens on the right side of the main front, while the evening light stays in the left side of the backpack half.
They provide security, uninterrupted service.
And since the pouches of the rucksack are also completely recycled from 100 percent recycled, fresher nylon, the contents of the rucksack then exchange themselves when going to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I received an email from his support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the posting of the
Contact has been established since the expedition to rescue the falsely accused Tisches.
I haven't received any news so far.
I want instant relief.
I have already written to the third support employee, and I got no further than the expectation that I would receive an email as proof.
This is the return of the falsified Custom #NAME#
It is therefore not surprising that the skunk could be released again.
For me, keeping you is not an option...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
Wants you another beautiful evening
Hello, my best customer is #NUMBER#. when will the article be delivered?
Delivery and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was given a completely different light than I requested
Please call me
If you give me the money, I will give you a bigger order, but I will keep the damaged item and not return it.
And I couldn't bring myself to think about it last year and didn't have the time and energy to look at it and understand it.
But the damage was as a customer and I didn't accept that.
Rotiger Bremsscheiben sind ausgelegt für den Anspruch des dynamischen Fahrers, der Verstärkung und Sicherheit bei den Bremsen auch unter schwierigen Bedingungen zu schätzen.
Rotiger Bremsscheiben are produced from gas and then mechanically processed (cut and shredded).
All unconscious shakes are processed in short series after individual technical equipment, which is for certain shakes and muscle contraction.
On the basis of the individual technical marking, a special production program will be set up, which will direct the production of the original montage after the effects of the original montage.
The low-profile cut-offs, which were produced in this manner, provide high comfort and Bremseffektivität.
In addition, machine-made openings increase the effectiveness of the helmet, which improves the ventilation of the breeches and breeches.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event was the story of the Westküste.
In the winter of 1848, a man on the southern bank of the American River discovered a bubbling rock in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the newness spread quickly and triggered the so-called 'Californian Gold Rush' from '49.
Tens of thousands came from Nah and Fern and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the state.
Walls were torn down, bottles were thrown, and clubs and hotels were almost over the night.
Everyone wanted their share of the country.
For many it was: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrott)!
In this game you are a player who is searching for a name in the West.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, train horses and build companies.
You will also get the opportunity to discover the facilities surrounding the river and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the others seem to have the same idea!
You have to meet your pilot's colleague to avoid getting stuck with the rest of them.
Coloma is a clever strategy game with many reasons for victory.
You are simultaneously launching your actions, you have to keep your resources in check and build a table that shows more and more for the EU.
The buildings on your table allow you to be more efficient, receive additional actions or apply rules to your heart.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plinthen, you can develop your individual game style with the help of careful adjustments.
Coloma played for a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California sought the official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players choose a location on the game plan from which they can carry out actions.
Afterwards, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneer on the current positions.
If a location has the most pioneers, he gets a prize!
This deactivates half of the positions - which means the possible actions are reduced there.
Then the players switch off actions such as the winning of resources, the stealing of vehicles, the construction of walls, the opening of shops and the placement of revolvers.
If all actions are stopped, the pioneers will return.
The purchaser looks for a new location at the beginning of each round and changes this accordingly.
This goes on for a long time, until the buyer has moved five times, so that each place is covered once and the year ends.
There is a shooting, in which the players Coloma have to defend themselves against a devastating bandits.
If the players have received enough revolvers and paid the bandits regularly, they will receive bonuses.
However, if they refuse, they will receive less food or end up on the streets.
The game ends after the third shot, then the final score is achieved.
The player with the most points wins!

Why children are not tyrants Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychical violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentation is now appearing in my Twitter timeline, and I have highlighted it.
>The child psychologist Michael Winterhoff is a cheerful guest in talk shows and has European ambitions.
With his book "Why our children are tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce debate.
Previous patients: now they are raising serious accusations against him.
Please watch the film carefully.
And I am very grateful that so many people are now thinking and acting differently.
We must never, ever, ever take power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child the freedom to develop and to make the child as large as possible, as is possible in the situation.
Brrr, I still feel cold.
Holetschek: States complain about test obligation for three-in-a-row
The health minister of the states want to decide on their next meeting on a national way to reduce the test obligation for three-digit impairments.
Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, told the Bild am Sonntag that "we need to get to the bottom of the matter as quickly as possible".
The 2G plus upgrade for three-way phones is "not only medically beneficial, but also provides an additional relief," said Holetschek.
Bundesminister für Gesundheit Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has suggested that he will make a statement at the health minister's conference next Tuesday. − AFP

How do I feel best here?
Hello, I like the #PRS_ORG# chair very much, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you please help me?
I cannot buy anything more on my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Up, it's a failure.
You can make purchases on the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I've updated the data.
Could this happen?
What you describe as *Awareness* is what you describe as *consciousness*.
These have a frequency of ca. 1 to 1000.
The most common reason for going to the doctor is for the treatment of pain, followed by the treatment of germs and infections.
Relevant for this topic: Kaiserschnitte are operations that have a high rate of awareness, as they involve dealing with a very high level of drugs.
Vorangegangene Episoden von Awareness should be mentioned in the Narkosevorgespräch.
Some specific procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT** Love everyone, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but had **Nitemarex **per definition no.
Is their comment wrong?
But the chair is defective.
We don't have the 20 euros either.
These are statutory fire protection measures.
The absolute minimum would be to return the defected seat.
This is also standard in the field of e-commerce.
Please check if you can at least return the defaced chair.
We sell the second seat then privately.
We also lose some money.
I already sent you an email, which you haven't answered.
Once again the question.
In the order and billing, the goods will be delivered to my choice in one room.
The driver is Company #.
I just called there.
He told me that she only delivers to the front door - for #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If not, I must cancel the order, as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture in the first stock.
Did I call you?
I had a question formulated
Theater historian Günther Rühle 97 years old dead
He has been identified as a theatre critic and an administrator.
Later he wrote a monumental theatrical history.
Günther Rühle, 97, died on Friday.
The new book is still on the table, pressed with force: "An old man will be an old man."
Günther Rühle, a theater historian and journalist, has led the unforgettable diary of a long-suffering exit from the world.
And in the middle comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I have already paid my debt here."

Tips and tricks for driving
I had a lot of great tips for the perfect gulash a week ago.
There was Christmas and it was delicious and delicious!
Thanks again:)
Now I have arrived at the shop and I wanted to go cycling to Silvester for the first time.
Today I will set a rabbit fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Remark: I don't have a hat, but only a big top.

Where there are still Christmas cheer in Lübeck
For many people Gans or Ente are part of the Christmas day like the tannenbaum and the gifts.
Have you still got a battery?
The time is almost here.
We will show you where you can still get a Christmas treat in Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a Röhrenendstufe is large in terms of warmth and sound retention.
These marks will be perfectly reproduced by the valve reactor control.
With the volume, gain and master volume regulator, you can adjust individually the desired pitch and other sounds.
The Verstärker of the VT+ Series offer a one-off power level regulator, which can be adjusted without changing the gain and the compression.
Further up, it was already said that one could even float with the POWER LEVEL REGULATOR, if it was not exceeded.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL REGULATOR, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The ticket office can also be used as a line entrance.
This signal is processed with a box simulation so that you get an eminent 'acoustic' clang sound when using a car or when driving.
You can connect a CD player or MP3 player to the auxiliary port so that you can jam your favorite songs.
There is also a tuner function on board - you do not need a separate battery.
If you also invest in a VFS5 soundbar, you can also use the soundbar as a soundbar, adjust the effect curve and change the tempo of the compatible effects.
For live use, this is actually unverifiable.
With its new power pack, VOX is taking another step in the future!
But it is not the case with others.
Do you want to put the light back on?
Is she for a party?
I would also send her back then.
Can you please help me with this?
And the clothes?
Will we receive an update to the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you already been to the #PRS_ORG# concert?
If it doesn't go, I'd be happy with a pen or pencil.
Among other things, I found an admirer for the furniture.
I don't need more than 1,000 euros for goods.
I received my delivery and I should have known that shards were part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# Spiegel (Tür).
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been completed
Is there a premium customer status for Euch?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreement
According to Iranian sources, progress has been made in the negotiations on a replacement for the international nuclear agreement.
The head of Iran's foreign ministry, Ali Bagheri, told the news agency Irna on Sunday that both sides should focus on the issues on the agenda.
This is a "positive and important development" because at first there was not even unanimity about the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Wiener Gespräche for the renewal of the association were held almost unanimously.
The negotiators of Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia took part in the negotiations.
There is also a US delegation in Vienna, but they are only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen overhauls large amounts of grain - now a federal state with the highest Corona index
Thuringia has cut back on subsidies and is currently the country with the highest income.
As a single federal state, the value of the mark is 1000.
As a single federal state, Thüringen raised the Corona Institute on Sunday over the 1000 mark.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections at 100,000 inhabitants.
This value, which had previously been the highest in the world, was recorded at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the building was empty in Thüringen, but it was also empty over the value of 1000.
In Thüringen, within a day, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported.
On Sunday, 200 seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated in intensive medical care.
At weekends, there can be complaints about service.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and are coming up with new cases hardly any more.
I understand that.
Since the delivery starts in March, it may be possible until then.
I must get rid of it and put it in the package and send it to the post?
do I have to do anything else?
I just want to avoid that, so I write to you.
I would like to take responsibility for my own costs.
8 euros is a freedom in my eyes.
It's time for changes
On my birthday, I welcome you, I am u/StratorDE in the Plenary Hall of Europe on a fantastic day!
Where is the post?
If you can trace the activity in the past few months of the MB parliament, you can find out: it is not real.
We came in a winter storm and spent the summer in the lake.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, where did it happen?
For the most part, this can simply be linked to the dissatisfaction, as some things have disappeared and as we generally see it.
Over the last few days, the impression has been growing that many here still have bottles on the MB day.
#What we must change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asking the MBundestag to hold this at life.
The attack came from u/edizVEVO, which has been highlighted in recent days on this project and has found just one, a scherbenhaufen.
After agreeing on a common interpretation, several people from the community have come up with the idea of restarting the project.
However, I still want to call on everyone to take part in this project, so that this can be a success in the future.
We have set up a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can discuss and work on specific issues.
The server can provide you with this link.
Purpose:
* How should the MBunday function in the future?
* What additional orders must be changed / adjusted?
* How should we look after ourselves in the future?
* How should new members be introduced?
* How do we create a fair system?
I am pretty sure I have forgotten something, but not terrible, so we have the discontent at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work with and decides democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade for you so that it will be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clunky for me and not for my business.
For this, I have already issued another notice.
I put it together and then realized it when I saw the burnt-out room.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite boring, because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the daydecking #PRS_ORG#, do you have the same in size, 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must still guarantee that the faulty spark will be corrected.
And I ask you to leave now.
I have not set up a paid package, but I will be able to deactivate it for the subscription - they will have to log in with #PRS_ORG# to do so.
#PRS_ORG# can call me at any time to arrange a meeting.
Is there a guide for assembly?
How long would I have had time to worry about this or decide on the return?
How does she respond to the question of why she is vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has been vegetarians for a while, and is probably quite rarely meat.
I was also a vegetarian some years ago.
On the question of whether I always want to be vegan, and whether Vegetarism is a planned step in the right direction, I have honestly answered this without much reflection.
And, of course, I longed for support as a vegetarian, but at some point I realized that I was also supporting animal agriculture.
So my decision to be vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that she had the impression on her page Missmut, she defended Vegetarism and said she knew where her meat comes from and how to reduce meat as a vegetarian.
Now I ask myself if my answer was "flat."
How does she respond to the question?
The feeling you get when you put on a pair of vegan shoes and get into conflict, without even trying.
It is a harmonious vegetarian (;
It is not an exception to paragraph 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# is not bound by the legal provisions for emergency services.
I am not going to the postponed date, the #PRS_ORG#.
Because I cannot go to the store because of a dispute, this also does not change.
May I be referred to an alternative appointment?
From 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be contacted again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr für Wasserrettung gerüstet: 45.000 Euro Zuschuss vom Land
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatine Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz in the Lahnsteiner Municipal Council approved a subsidy of 45,000 euros for the new water treatment plant of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein at the mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, is 135,000 euros.
Investing in security.
I am happy that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us here, says Lahnsteins mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle will be used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, one of the seven units in Rhineland-Pfalz.
They provide tasks in water and sewage treatment, as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one can expect steady growth with increasing numbers: The boom in the tourism industry on the Rhine and Moselle and the further increase in the use of the lake as a leisure flow bring about this.
I bought a book that I could only read to 10% and then tried to solve the problems.
I can't open the book.
However, they have synchronised, deleted and reloaded the app NICHTS has worked.
I am frustrated because I have been spending so much time on the whole campaign and now I want to help.
Okay, that's so.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# in June.
Can I add a date to my order?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the previously tested values in the Fenix labor at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% air flow and the integrated 275mAh LiPo battery are determined.
The values can vary depending on the used flashlight, age and location.

Thank you for that, but I have also spent almost a decade in the State Department in a similar job, so I don't want to go any further!
The question of rights and links has always been very difficult for me.
In principle, however, one should say that the state service is more likely to come from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, all of this should be obvious to anyone who knows that these people should be able to move comfortably around the real world, that is, that they can be hard to deal with when it comes to the real world, that is, when it comes to the real world.
But even these small groups also reflected the conservative attitude in my experience after a conservative approach, and they were proud of Germany and felt more relaxed through overactive left-wing politics, even if this policy is generally used for them. They just want to be treated normally.
Back to the rights, of course, as police and security forces are also going to have a say in shaping society, but they have extreme rights to say whatever they want to say there, and even if it is against the law.
Of course, there is the risk that even police and soldiers will start to question the often negative experiences they had in the foreign service, and that even dangerous things are said by the controversial and politically incorrect.
It is also coming before that certain right-wing judges will also be involved in the trial.
However, I think it will be well received and also with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so very international, and that is also good for me, because we cannot have any real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I also ordered the other Korb on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
As I requested, it was not sold.
I have already ordered in November.
But it was confirmed in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I have previously paid with #NAME#.
Alternatively, one could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# Korb for #NUMBER# Euro in Schwarz to Germany or is this Korb also available in Germany.
I always see you as a partner company.
But on the other side of the mountain there are two small caves that are filled with something similar
and on the Spiegel itself is a small cripple
More expensive by child?
Hello, I am (w32) engaged in a job for a long time.
I am very specialized and organized on the job (I am self-employed, very little free time), but I have been living in my house for a long time and I have seen it get worse than it has to.
There are always phases where everything is possible, and then and when I feel tired and I fall asleep and push myself.
But it is actually never so "that someone could come to visit spontaneously."
My husband is (sorry) not much better, but at least he has a roof over his head and a place to sleep.
The kitchen will still be built according to the regular schedule.
Now to my question, do you think it would be easier for her to be ordained with children?
We still have to work, but this question has been on my mind for a long time.
Because I don't have an appetite for it, it doesn't bother me at all as long as no visitors come and so on.
Do you want to wear a hat with a bigger crown or do you want to stay dry?
Thank you for your answers.

Careers in social work - as someone with a self-limited personality disorder?
I have made a training in the field of software development and have been successful since about a year ago.
However, I am always cheaper to think that this is not the right thing for me, so I have waited for a long time to try again and study social work again.
The problem: I have a self-limited (bzw. frightening) personality disorder (AVPS).
This means that I do not have a self-esteem and feel ashamed.
I don't have a problem talking to people at a more relaxed level, but I find it very difficult to hold a serious conversation and I have already been told that I am too lazy (which I already thought was better).
Can I be a social worker?
I don't want to work as a streetworker or in the open youth market, but more in particular in the search for employment or in the family support.
But I don't know if the actual working day is really like I thought it was, and it's difficult to find something online.
The AVPs are already running into problems in my job (for me, emotional), because it drives me nuts whenever something goes wrong in my code ("just the most annoying thing ever") and it makes me feel like I should ask for help from my colleagues ("I should learn to do it myself right now / I should stop asking for help from the work / he has to help me a lot more" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every service, but I wanted to have them discussed at the meeting.
Have you already stored the sofa?
Because of this, there is no proof.
I wanted a date for release
What do you want me to do with it?
If I have read a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the complaint comes from I #PRS_ORG# authorised this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my order.
The protein contained in the Eiweiß (protein) fed to the bird in its gizzard is transferred to the individual Eiweißbaustoff (amino acids) in the gizzard, which he also needs for digestion.
The breeding picture of the nestling and the breeding picture of the bird of prey are extremely complex prerequisites and are connected to the overall organization of the animal with a particularly high level of protection.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be broken during the race, as it can only cause disruptions in the race.
In addition to this regular supply of NEKTON-Bio, the supply of vitamin NEKTON- (Multivitamin preparation) and mineral NEKTON-MSA (Mineralstoff preparation) should be resumed.

How can a burostuhl be knocked down after 9 months?
The wage claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order has arrived and pictures have been taken.
Have you received this email?
Responding to a complaint from a member of the community
Hello r/legaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our site, a walnut tree will be planted.
Also filed a complaint against the municipality.
One employee writes to me that the problem of obstructions and thus the wall noise is not part of the bill.
In the arrangement, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as being to be protected.
Can I now leave the statement of the employee?
On the one hand, I have to leave an expert meeting.
On the other hand, the arrangement is already clear.
Thank you for your answers
We see this.
Then we will use the new packaging for them.
I have received no message
Naja, then I still had a sofo without use.
Could you give me a pen or a pencil?
What were the more expensive?
Yes, that's what I thought, only the question is whether I can pay in euros and send the decks to Germany
Can you check it?
Road accident: Heavy traffic accident on road
Recently, a severe traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the junction Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
According to the police alarm (14:03), a Pkw was stolen in the opposite direction.
There are injured.
Okay.
Good, then a lot of thanks for just going!
Rat and ideas to further career
First time in years!
My Christmas is unfortunately good because my heart is filled with everything I can think of, what I can think of.
Before I come here now... for a short period: I need a rat and the best of people who know a bit about my situation - that is, the EU.
I particularly like the ref as a challenge.
Originally I had studied something else and also worked in a field (at least a little anonymously to stay, I don't know here exactly).
But then it all became too long and I thought about alternatives that could make me more happy.
One day I went to the office and was sure that it was - even though the conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but that was okay.
I have now arrived at the third "Google other star names".
And it is only half a year.
For the time being, I have always decided to continue to do it and at least to finish it.
But I am absolutely ready.
I had so little free time in the last month that I completely exhausted myself.
Now it's holidays, but there is still work to be done.
I always wanted to be stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my holiday my holiday.
I was released.
And the stress on the job was equal at the time.
Now I'm feeling the stress of the family celebration too much.
And then these structures stood in front of me, which made me feel more nervous.
In essence, it is fun and is seen from outside, which is what the feedback and so describes it.
But I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can handle before it completely hurts - if it doesn't already do that.
I ask myself whether I wanted to go back to the old area - especially when I read some of the eu's contributions here - or whether I should go back to the old area, where I was valued, and where I was able to work for free when I needed it, and the work was at least as long-lasting, but was paid fairly and was part of a team that was working together and not just as an individual like the case now.
But then I ask myself, did I not come back to the same place a year ago as now and unhappy?
You think it's all a bit weird, but maybe it was a bit of an afterthought or an idea, as I came out of this situation, which I am almost finished with and which I have been thinking about for the longest time.
I'm not going to make decisions emotionally right now, which may not lead to anything good.
But maybe help me with at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy it on Christmas Eve, which I already have for the first time.
Thank you for reading and sorry for the embarrassing sound of me.
I hope my situation is at least somewhat clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has continued to develop, which led to the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" system, which allows the behavior of a rooster to be perfectly captured.
With the VT20X/ VT40X/ VT100X Amps, we present a brand new modelling engine that is in fact at the forefront of the latest technology.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is used in the analysis of the components and the amps, the VTX boosters have waited for an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
This amp also contains the more expensive Valvetronix resistors.
This is partly due to the fact that these are the pitch variations and nuances of a real drummer, just better than any simulation.
In addition, the VTX boosters offer a closed garage and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only sound so loud.
With the "Voice Room" software from VOX, you can even correct historical facts on the virtual stage, even if the amp and the effects sound as if you have always imagined them.
The perfect combination of Röhren Sound and Modeling Technology is in line with the 2001 VOX Valve Reactor Technology.
She herself has been repeatedly challenged over the past few years to accommodate new sound requirements, which VOX's Valvetronix series led again in 2010 - with more dynamism and numerous and decisive improved boosters.
The new VT+ Valvetronix series, from hand to hand, was also made so that all boaters can find the maximum sound quality here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and the dynamism of a rhythm guitarist: They expect a clean sound, a nuanced transfer of sound dynamics and Saitenanschlag as well as a prompt response.
During an ongoing analysis, the VOX engineers have discovered that, above all, the endstops determine the character of a strong supporter and develop the VOX valve reactor technology based on this funding.
The 12AX7 valve regulator of every VT+ accelerator forms the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of an accelerator.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic's defeat series in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but there is no way to defeat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven assists from his oldest brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main focus is also adjustable: with three individually adjustable plazier- and flatbare Klettverschluss-team members, it goes all the way back to the need for your photo editing and is therefore suitable for all kinds of cameras - from specialized system cameras to full-format reflective cameras.
What is ultimately in the pocket, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the objectivity of the object.
One possible replacement would be a DSLR camera with an adjustable objective, two to three interchangeable lenses and a zoom lens.
More DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fujifilm X-T2 leave room for further objective.
In addition, one can still buy a large number of household goods.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT-Kameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use it for your equipment and for photo freelancers.
Drohnen pilots also opt for the Everyday Backpack 20L as a good choice, because the rucksack offers plenty of space for a DJI Mavic Pro.
Vulkan eruption on La Palma: probably the longest story
In the nearly three months since the start of the outbreak, the lava tubes have been severely damaged on the Kanarian island.
Is there an end in sight?
With an extension of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been going on since Sunday of the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in the year 1585 has been described as the longest on the Atlantic coast before the West Coast of Africa.
There are no definitive data on earlier harvests.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja in recent days has been somewhat reduced, but volcanologists did not predict when it could end.
The indicators are showing an increase.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island region, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to state TV station RTVE.
Damage in millions of dollars
In the nearly three months since the start of the eruption, the more than 1,000 degrees hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Just under 1,200 hectares have been covered by a flooded lake.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage estimated at more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, two new settlements with a size of about 50 hectares were created by eroding lava.
The most seriously affected area was the banana plantation for the island, from which about half of the 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the eruption.
225 hectare banana plantations were destroyed, other areas heavily infested, wrote El País.
Christmas and the gifts
Weihnachts is before the door and the children will hardly be able to wait for the divine feast.
The many bright gifts under the Christmas tree have been associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the tense atmosphere.
Christmas is one of the few traditional holidays that keep our divided society together.
The more important thing is to be aware of the holiday tradition of the Schenkens so that the gesture of the Schenkens, which was the result of the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss's work, that the routine was interrupted and in the context of this tradition could be filled again with life.
How was the Christkind from Nikolaus?
The protesters were taken to the stage by force, through which the Weihnachtstage was robbed of the people.
Previously, on the Nikolausday, the chocolate was overdone.
The backdrop of this still-loved story is that the holy Nikolaus, as a bishop of Myra, had three women in a night locked in their window to save them from another life in Suse.
From this unconventional art of sealing, the in Germany loved brewery went out of its way to fill the castle with children.
Protesters feel this need because they see themselves as intermediaries between God and the people.
From these grounds, they rejected the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christkind from Nikolaus and founded a new tradition line.
The focus of the visit shifts to the holy evening.
However, most Protestants do not see such detail questions anymore, only the few that the need of the holy Nicholas is similar to the need of the martyred Nicholas with the martyred Nicholas and the martyred Nicholas.
Today one finds oneself in Stiefeln, before the church and under the Christmas tree of socks, all the luxuries that the heart desires.
Various traditions in Christian countries
Records reveal a tradition of the cheese since the 13th century on the day of the holy Nikolaus.
With the Reformation, the day of the feast of the Assumption was postponed.
In all christian areas, however, there is a fragrant smell over the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the particular region, whether the Christkind will appear at the holy evening or the Weihnachtsmann, who is usually a kind of Nikolaus, who has been commissioned with the time.
For example, his thin straw hat, which still has a slight gap with the more closely related Assyrian hat of the historical figure, his scaly skin, which is brushed by rentiers and the cover of the cabin for access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, the holy Nikolaus remains the central figure at the Christmas feast.
In Spain, the holy three kings give the gifts, while in Italy the heksus child is the one who is supposed to lead them to Jesus.
In Scandinavia, on the other hand, the goods were brought to Sweden, while in Russia, there was frost to contend with.
Here are not rentiers, but three horses that run as a Troika.
In the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars, this Christkind is responsible for the distribution of goods.

Police arrest suspected bank robbers near the royal palace
On Saturday near Kensington Palace in London, a concerned police officer was shot.
The police said an informant had reported seeing a man with a gun in a bank and the shop of a bookstore.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle, which was later stopped by officials.
They fell into the river and the man was hit.
He was still arrested at the time.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
In the vicinity of the Kensington Palace, several agents are attached.
The palace is the official residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The sound reproduction of the LokSound 5 was once again improved.
An adjustable variable PWM-taktfrequencies of 10kHz to 50kHz is particularly beneficial for gunfire engines for a superb operation – this is the typical ‘brummel’ of the past.
The rule can now be applied to even more difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "autotune" function allows the automatic adjustment of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 Decoder also provides power for older motors up to 1.5 A.

Pill problem
Hello beloved women,
I hope I did everything right, after a year Reddit is actually my first post.
For my problem: I had to take the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I suffered so much pain during the period and I had PMS.
Now I would like to leave it alone, because I have to take medication that I cannot afford.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my head.
I had received my last about two-and-a-half years ago of 0 to 100 explosive picks and that all over.
As soon as I got so excited, but I didn't feel it at all.
In the two years since the pause, the whole has never really normalized.
Maybe he has some tips for avoiding this one.
My cosmetics is already perfume-free and without dyes, but maybe that is what I can't stop myself from doing.
The female doctor took me so seriously and the dentist came.

It can also be good that hormones are just the fire, but if you want to know everything about my body, stop searching for anything else.

110kV electricity cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the transfer of the new high speed rail system to Tann is legally binding.
The government of Niederbayern has approved the construction plan, which should start in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayern.
The seven-kilometer long cable will link the power station Tann in the north of the municipality and the 110-kilovolt power station between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be attached to a mast at the town of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts.
The blue bet number: #PRS_ORG# with the sending number #NUMBER# was sent back to #PRS_ORG# with the message "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a display is definitely possible.
Can you tell me about the further process?
A beautiful start in the week!
You can forget that I have already explained this more than once!!
This is a commode from glass and the entire surface is glazed, so that the glass and the cardboard are crushed
The comforter is in my apartment and I am obligated to come to the apartment for the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the comforter cannot be pulled out because no one in my house has room for it
Thanks for the news
But why only 20 euros?
The origin value of this place is #NUMBER# EUR
No, it applies to all stores, so the request at #PRS_ORG#, which is probably a general problem
Ref: Education plan (EK)
Hello friends and colleagues,
I have been out of school for the summer, which I enjoy, but I still have a lot of problems to plan my teaching in the field of ecology.
However, my school is technically not well equipped so that I can use the table, the textbook and an OHP as a medium in principle.
In the school, I can also copy s/w for free (which is expensive for me).
I need to plan my hours in a very short time.
We do, for example, regularly cover the topic of geofactors and I spend every minute for myself.
In principle, the methods are repeated again and again, but I do not want to invest too much time in simple teaching hours (which I also need for UBs).
I actually go to the planning from the learning point of view (what I want to get) and overestimate how I can build it (I usually start with a working paper with text from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
So also the working class.
Maybe one day I can work as an editor like a bookworm.
If you really love me.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided for a new at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to withdraw the money as quickly as possible.
The trade is threatened by the 2G regulation.
In most shops, only those who are impounded or detained are allowed to enter.
The trade is unnecessarily expensive and complains about spare parts.
He also proposed a possible solution.
The 2G regulation from the hands of the German Handelsverein (HDE) has lost its significance for the retail trade.
Umsatzeinbrüche should be filed for companies with non-stock goods, criticised HDE chief executive Stefan Genth.
According to a recent HDE survey of more than 1,000 companies, more than 70 percent of companies looked down on the rest of the year.
Many had already written about the holiday.
What is actually the positive peak of the year should be, is now often a lake without bottom, said Genth.
In the run-up to the holiday, retailers with 2G restrictions lost almost a third of their sales.
It is only in the life sciences and online market.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The sale with masks, distance and hygienic concept is a safe measure, said the chief executive.
He stressed that "2G brings us no further in the fight against the pandemic."
The current rules shocked customers and required high personnel investment.
He demanded that the ban be lifted nationwide.
After that, each customer would only have to be controlled on 2G (impeded or unimpeded) and would have access to this day to all businesses.
In addition, in the individual market - as already in the public traffic with the 3G regulation (imposed, hidden or tested) - should stick-probe checks be made available.
The specialist real estate group Deutsche Euroshop also spoke of a difficult Christmas sale.
The frequencies last without 2G at a good 75 per cent of the pre- Corona level, and at around 90 per cent for circa 90 per cent.
These numbers will now fall in the so important Christmas business," said head of sales Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
In the face of the high personnel and administrative costs, the Center will try to find solutions and be approved.
Then there is the so-called bändchenlösung, at which the "visitors, for example, can bring their 2G credentials to a central location in the Center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel - unblock all shops". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The Spiegel has a cracker and, at the same time, a fault, which was attempted to be filled with a similar substance.
It looks ugly.
I would like to return the Spiegel and have it packed and shipped again.
How do I go about the return now?
The lamp is built for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD -LEDs with higher performance and higher bandwidth.
For setting the color temperature and luminance of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with unique possibilities is needed.
In addition to the reduction of the heat load, there are two standard color temperatures: daytime and nighttime.
It is also possible to determine the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K manually and to store it.
Use the current settings in Flash memory.
One of the most distinctive marks of the controller is simply and intuitive.
The laser creates a very bright light with a high quality of light, completely free of color.
The 120-degree glow of the light bulb, which you can squeeze into a relatively small space, is amazing.
Especially in reporting situations in small rooms or in isolated situations.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool for both filming and working in the studio.
The optional DMX512 -Controller allows the firing of the leech in television studios or when the leech is mounted in difficult locations.
At the back of the device is the control panel, which is made up of tests and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for the NP-FF (not included in the delivery)
Alarm detector The detector has up to three panel settings for sound and temperature.
To drive the settings of the individual settings to the storage plugs, just long-drawn through one of the storage plugs and finished.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching, so that the known situation is restored when new switches are inserted - very practical for studio work when zB. the camera is set at certain temperatures.
Work with battery is one of the strongest strengths of DL3120 functionality.
This often happens in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can return to existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check whether the battery has enough power before the set - it is a battery tester just like the one with built-in battery - for each of the two battery packs (the left battery on the left side, the right on the bottom).
In addition, it is obviously possible for the shaver to continuously supply power to the attached network segment.
The construction of the blade is very simple.
They have a 16mm lens as an attachment, so you can shoot directly at your subject.
The climb is made up of two parallel sections.
This was also the case with the mechanical components, which were extremely accurate and thus also applied to reliability and hard work.
In addition, a snowflake is included in the delivery.
This is also true in the delivery.
So you can buy the leech with all the supplies you would like to, without problems transporting or storing.
Shame, I have gotten it and it is too small:(
Party we want to see": Frankfurt celebrates towering comeback against Leverkusen
What was for Eintracht Frankfurt's spectacular reaction.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in the Serie, the last two times in the Serie, the last time in the Serie, the last time in the Serie and the last time in the Serie, the last time in Serie and the last time in Serie, the last time in Serie, the last time in Serie and the last time, the last time in Serie and the last time in the Serie, the last Serie and the last time in Serie, the last Serie and the last Serie, the last Serie and the last Serie and the last Serie and the last Serie in Serie, the last Serie in Serie and the last Serie in Serie, the last Serie and the last Serie in Serie and the last Serie and the last Serie in Serie in Serie, the last Serie in Serie in Serie and the last Serie in Serie in Serie in Serie, the last Serie and the last Serie.
But then the SGE took on the pressure and within a good half an hour they felt the frustration of a disappointing start to the season from the Seele and scored a 5-2. "It is astonishing what the boys have done today," jubilated trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke of a "pauschal lob, on every single one of them who was with them".
There was initially a renewed sense of hope for Frankfurter, who had been waiting for a new hero for a long time.
Patrik Schick had the Leverkusens with 2:0 in front.
What happened then, also impressed the SGE coach.
Glasner added: "The players then returned and showed a fantastic performance."
I am happy with the performance we have shown and obviously with the result.
As well as defence player Christopher Lenz, who was back on the pitch for the first time since the fourth game day and his devastating muscle injury, he stressed the moral of his team mates.
I think our mentality is very large," said the 27-year-old and enjoyed the result in particular for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to see today.
For the coming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but also on the personnel situation in general.
It is unusual for us all to be fit in December that all players are physically in a top level.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live high-profile.
Now you want to "go one step at a time and stay focused" and "go one step at a time and stay focused" until the end of the year.
As the next game is already scheduled for Wednesday in the course of the English week at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18:30, Sky) on the program.
I got the mail back because it was sent to me by mistake.
I have tried to contact #PRS_ORG# and let them know that there is no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is back and the order again?
If that were the case for me now, I would probably not have asked for it because it has already been done a long time ago.
Have you ever been to the #PRS_ORG# Stühlen?
Volunteers for women's handball at the fourth quarter against Spain
After defeating Denmark, Germany's women’s handball players clenched their fists and glowered from the bench.
At the conclusion of the World Cup, the DHB selection beat 800 spectators in Granollers 16-32 (8-13) and now faces Spaniards in the quarter-finals.
"We were much too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent," said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We have to deal with Spain differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the front line group III with 8.2 points as second behind the Dutch (10.0).
It is sad that we could not take the flow with us.
That was one of the worst games we have to lose, captain Emily Bölk said.
In the fight for the medal in the half-finals, against the World Championship team of 2019 on the next Tuesday, a significant rise is needed to keep the bitter dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Another German competitor in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Alina Grijseels with six goals.
We were just not there - not in the attack, not in the defense," said Rückraumspielerina Xenia Smits, and urged: "We have to look quickly to the future."
Up to now not hinting at the height
In contrast to the five previous tournaments, the German team did not reach the top.
Fehlwürfe und technische Fehler in der Angriff- und Lücken in der Abwehr hatten für einen schnellen 0:4-Rückstand nach sieben Minuten verantwortliche.
In particular, Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was so quickly on the brink of death and prevented with several parades.
The first Tor went to the DHB team after 9:30, when Grijseels managed to score a sharp counter-attack.
However, this was not the case.
In the face of the aggressive decking of the women, the German women could hardly put up with it - and even when they did, they struggled against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the Tor of the Scandinavians.
So was the party at 3:10 in the morning, when Rückraumspielerina Mia Zschocke later saw red for a hard foul on her opponent's sparring partner.
In the fourth quarter, however, she may again participate.
Only in the closing phase of the first half-time came the DHB selection a bit better into the game and at least five goals until the break.
After the change of pace at the end of the first minute, the team was already in a state of despair at 9: 19.
The green guardians fired again in all areas and made it clear to the defeated opponent, who counts as a medallist at the end of the tournament, so that simply.
Consequently, the German team was no longer able to reach a level of performance and became a clear loser from the bench.
DACH-Adventskalender Tag 6: Family traditions in the Christmas time
In the context of the Reddit advent calendar, we celebrated the Nikolaus day and took the inspiration to widen family traditions in the pre-Christmas time, the Advent, Nikolaus, Holy night and the Christmas feast day.
How was it then at home?
What about our partners?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the best for children?
The building?
Plätzchenbacken?
Do you want to build a house?
Is it necessary?
Does the Christmas man, the Christkind or is the gift just from Oma and Opa?
No matter how you do it, everyone gets together and around Christmas. It's so beautiful to have a family.
Is the now famous tradition, or even every year something else: tell us how it is in your family!
Please send me a transaction number. Or otherwise, what could I help with?
Proof of... etc
I would like to hide a secret code

The title implies that I am working as an importer in mobile trucks, where (to date) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is imported.
As soon as this is done, I will go to an impound for myself.
I will answer questions without a time limit to the organisational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, if these are not personalized (e.g. "I take medicine X, and it makes me feel sick..").
In my area of focus, the diagnosis for the impfung, the indication (person has claim to an impfung after Corona prescription and no grounds to speak otherwise), the medical documentation and, above all, the prevention of allergic reactions (I have never passed this).
The infection itself is delegable to qualified personnel, for example, medical assistants.
In four months, however, we have often no where to go, but only "only" (for the sake of wanting no missing value!) pharmazeutisch-technische Assistenten for the impingement of the impingement, but cannot impinge (can you?), so that I can also feel the most impingements myself.
Serious "hoarder"-question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "hoarder?"
With this dialect word, from an Austrian immigrant, it has been recorded in the BR television broadcast "We're in Bayern" for deep thought.
But the concept remained in the line of "host mi?" this time from the visitors.
No, it was not a "monster".
And no one has to "go all the way".
This, the people of the TV moderator heard, was completely wrong.
Why did the man from Amberg give the solution to the problem and thus probably also for many Oberpfälzer for retirement.
The fugitive is a thief, the audience is warned.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, from the Bavarian TV station for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the tag that this is a typical oberpfalzish term, it is a bit removed from the more well-known Houdern.
If there was a gap in education - perhaps even among those who have lived in the area for a long time.
I can't buy any more books for two weeks.
After the verification, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have connected the #PRS_ORG# to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
No one has come.
Reifenwahl beim Rennrad - wirklich so pannensicher?
Today morning I was full of excitement because I wanted to prepare for my road trip in the coming week.
Said, bought and I bought it on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also quite beautiful - but then it went, what in every inner city (this time Danke Krefeld!) looks like.
Glassplatter on the road.
Zack, laches Zischen und mein Hinterreifen wolle den Rest der Strecke nicht mehr mitmachen.
Because I did not have the opportunity to go shopping on the weekend, I had to return home with half a loaf of bread and the last train.
Then it was not as bad as it was now, maybe it is even better if I listen to the Radtour again.
But now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I had a relatively long walk over several days, I would definitely get a lot more done on this problem.
Now it is really not bad, because the old rides from the owner (a very nice old man, came to the track on the day I took it off at the end of the day at 120 km from him!) and the owner, who has been playing with them for years, are still suboptimal.
But if I think I still have to drive at 80-90kms, then I'm really bad at it:)
Now I met a senior man at the train station, who asked me why I didn't want to take the Marathon Plus Run; this should be as easy as possible.
Now the whole thing is obviously very disappointing.
But are these really so unbreakable?
I now have little desire to spend 40 euros for a ride, only to be disappointed afterwards.
I still ask myself: I thought I had 25x622 at the time.
There is also (allegedly) at the Marathon Plus Reifen, but the majority is already broader.
Is this a problem?
Or would you like to give me a ride to another race?
The Schwalbe-Seite seems to be my absolute! Laiewissen eher den Durano DD to avoid?
Thank you again in advance for the help and love!

After the publication of our new High End Breitbänders B 100-6 OHM, there was only one question of time before our SOLO series would also receive success.
SOLO 15 is the new starter and reminds you of the big Vorbilder with the B 200-6 OHM.
However, in this building design, there is a passable design of a designer step directly in the way to raise the speaker's voice to the correct position.
This has no effect on the sound and can be adapted in length accordingly.
The SOLO 15 is very well suited for people who play the maximum sound pressure level a more subdued role, but a surprisingly high level should be reached.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of producing a nearly undisturbed loud sound.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 is loud.
In the end, she is quite grown up and for her size quite impressive and accurate.
The SOLO 15 was equipped with a soft throttle.
This is generally the case for breitbartenders who want to increase their frequency.
Exactly at the Hörplatz, the SOLO 15 is very clear and sharp.
The Highlands can be reduced in size and the sound can be made more intense.
Thanks to the pitch scale, the location of the individual components of a musical piece in optimal stereo three-dimensional space can be precisely determined.
The reference-dangerous extreme narrow mechanical loss of B 100-6 OHM would cause a fear of dynamism for the same reason.
The SOLO 15 adds not only to our SOLO series, but extends this in the form of accessories and attachments.
As is the case with all of our building materials, we started to think about the final optic of the speaker at the beginning of the project, in order to make corresponding changes to the construction.
If you need to furnish the rooms, you have to apply for the reduction of the water pressure accordingly, as the supply of material is still being made.
After all the plates were removed (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill a 8 mm hole into the bottom plate at the corresponding location, so that later you can connect the cable through it.
With the help of a subframe, the launch of the B 100-6 OHM will now follow, so that the B 100-6 OHM can be used later.
This opening should be done in a 45-degree phase so as to be able to handle the opening area of the sailboat in the interior as much as possible.
The four rocket boosters of the B 100-6 OHM will receive an abort in the phase, as shown in the picture.
After that, you start to build the box and place one of the two panels on a flat surface.
Now the back, the deck, the front and the bottom are covered.
The three suspensions should also be used and punished.
The impressions themselves can vary depending on the level of demand, for example, if you want to create 16 mm MDF from the wood market.
The second page will be added in the next step.
After that, all the plates of the game, also the two sides and the front, follow.
Using a passing cable or a forstnerbohrer, the opening of the bass reflex roof and the connection to the back wall will be facilitated.
Finally, one uses a round brush to brush all the corners of the actual box.
The surface of the floor can also be covered.
In addition, the road surface is fixed to the floor of the garage and is then covered with long wooden beams.
It follows the marking and indentation (2.5 mm bore) of the screw threads of the power transmission unit and the connection cable.
After the house of holzstube has been consecrated (unburied / unburied), one begins with the transfer of the chalice.
This is done by the 35 mm Bassreflex opening in the back.
This is done by driving the entire and complete cable piece through the 8 mm Bohrung in the direction of the terminal opening and allowing it to rise up to about 30 cm there.
In the upper part of the building, the cable leads to the water pump and allows it to be locked in there as well.
Then the frequency wave is prepared and used.
The frequency plan and corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document: Montageanleitung Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency wave is built and the subscriber terminal is scratched, the 8 mm cable opening in the inner box is still not completely closed.
With the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and a bit of trick, you can let your hair down with the opening and leave it.
By opening the B 100-6 OHM and using a small light bulb, one can check the abdication accordingly.
Now follows the demolition according to description.
Finally, the B 100-6 OHM will be completed and the corresponding screws fixed.
The polarization plays here a significant role, so that the plus lead (marked cable) must be connected to the plus pole of the speaker (the larger contact).
At the end, the bass reflex is cut to the length of 28 mm (the full length of the drum) and embedded.
For the demolition, a matte of the demolition material is pressed into two pieces and locked in the room.
The opening of the bass reflex channel should be saved.
Can I give you a delivery even now and start June?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will also be hosting the OSCAST this year!
We are not able to get more than four people into the studio at a time, which is a higher level of planning and explains the shorter length of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per sheet so that we can stream the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 Bohnen in the stream and hopefully follow tens of thousands of people from all over the EU!
We solve our best, delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as smooth as possible.
It will be about 0.30.
Eats a good meal, plants a good egg, and makes you ready for a long, but very interesting night.
