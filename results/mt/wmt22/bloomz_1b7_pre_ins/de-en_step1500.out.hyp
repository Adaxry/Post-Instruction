The goods cost under 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the goods value test...
I'm #PRS_ORG# a big guy and that's not a problem for me.
I only need a number or instruction so that I can track the package for you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago for 249 euros...
It costs 179 euros today.
I honestly find it very hard.
Should I cancel the order and resend it for a better price or is there another way to sign?
In principle, I also think that children should not be allowed to assume a parent role for their little sisters.
However, I find that it is also a good thing to take care in measuring things with the small.
Just look, just help, just bring the bottles etc.
So they learn responsibility, help their families and are integrated.
As long as they can keep up with their own needs, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is occupied for the short time all by itself and it is OK for you, that's good.
You can best determine for your children.
It is not so that he is going to K2-walk and spend hours doing stretching.
It is likely that the reins are too tight.
Perhaps the psychologist's statement also applies.
Because if something actually happens, like a fire, an earthquake, an alien invasion etc., it would really be too much of a responsibility for K1 to worry about K2.
Whether there is now a risk that you want to take is of course up to you;)
Help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost all of the details, but I don't want the title to fall any more...
The story deals with fear and how to overcome it.
At the beginning of the story, a shepherd kills herself by overfeeding herself and falling into a ravine.
The case is being taken over by a commissioner after a short investigation into his therapists. The clinic where he is afraid of patients is being investigated.
The commissioner has a small niche that also has fear (before the fire) and this therapist is coming.
There is more self-centeredness and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is assigned to go to the site of the suicide and to document it and to put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it is ultimately up to this Therapeut to a certain extent to perform a kind of psychological treatment group, where the patient is implanted a chip in the brain that inhibits an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately forces the patient to confront their extreme fears.
(A woman springs out of the window with intent to kill)
This fear is depicted in the book as "the fight."
There will be a big showdown in the clinic of the one who had a fire.
That is the crux of the matter, I am certain that the book was adapted from a French author / author.
If anyone knows about this action or if anyone can reveal the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, I forgot the password for my WiFi.
You must contact your man first.
But that may take time.
What steps must I take afterwards?
Is it also possible to reverse the award?
Kind, 4 j., Splitter under the Daumennagel
Kind, four years, has over the whole length of the wooden splitter under the wooden floor (side).
Have tried to pull him with a pin.
Very difficult to catch.
Did not slip and fell.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chances.
It is time for the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of digital decoders and sound modules on a head plate, we can achieve reductions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and thus be able to be built almost into almost every loop of the shapes H0 and 0.
LocSound 5 decoders are always supplied with all necessary attachments and come always with a 11x15mm large "feed tube" according to size.
Like all family members, the LokSound 5 is a real multiprocessor decoder.
It controls the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 links are automatically generated, as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically connect to a designated digital central office.
It controls all DCC programme modi and thanks RailCom® for the CV values on the main gauge.

Wegen Omikron: Johnson wants to put an end to bailouts
New Omikron cases worry politicians and scientists in Britain.
All those qualifying adults in England are to receive a deposit.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to speed up the introduction of the coronavirus vaccine as quickly as possible compared to what has been agreed up to now.
Every adult in England should receive a boosting dose by the end of the year, as long as they have been taking it for at least three months since the second lockdown, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a recorded video conference with his staff.
So far, the delivery date has been at the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to help speed up the campaign in the states of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the Omikron variant, Johnson said, urgently needed to be strengthened the protection against infections.
The good news is that the level of protection can be raised again with a third dose.
Now shut up, said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, there was a rise of 65 percent. dpa
Will the full benefit be returned from the purchase price?
I'm there to make everyone comfortable
I have received an invitation.
Today, the invitation came in the mail.
I want to respond to the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter," but something more complicated.
I have hugged him/her and depending on where he/she lives, it is either a man or a woman.
**I don't know how to write an email now.
Can you help me?
** I am an outsider and do not want any officials to touch my feet.
Conclusion: each should stand with pronouns.
There were a total of 5 books missing.
Four of them.
Just the one I don't have anymore
Obviously, the chair had a lack of storage.
How can such a loss be shown after 9 months?
First on #PRSORG#.
It does work since about.
No more 14 days.
Therefore, I have always purchased the last books over the website and then translated them into #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
But there was no more.
They are now available again and I want you to add 2 to your order and put it on your bill.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help it.
Content warning: I will write something more detailed about house arrest.
I just have to write what I think.
I (21) often come from a professional background to contact the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence.
There is a topic that really haunts me and unfortunately, too many victims do not help themselves or think we should not help them.
I'm absolutely clear that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are things in my job that make me feel more at ease when I can't do anything about such situations.
I see the blue threads, the blood, the swollen eyes...
But even in conversation with four eyes, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing, I cannot achieve all of it.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of responsibility, fear of abandoning the social world, fear of losing the children.
What I always wanted to make clear, partly on purpose, is that all of them can live without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to take simple violence.
I often wish I could help in every case... I know that I can't.
However, it will never happen.
Please always think of her as having value without violence, that is so important.
Arcane on Netflix: What is driving the series to "League of Legends"?
Much fantasy, many complicated names, a dazzling achievement: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, is currently on Netflix.
Why do we love the already announced two teams?
Football Bundesliga: Derby between MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick, there was relief.
Nothing again: The Riesen in Crailsheim lost their nerve the second time within not more than three months - and so!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with regard to the relegation from the Pokal early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in the chest."
However, it did not sit well with them after the game - and again after the 61-72 (28-38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
How much more the result was the way and manner of the award revealed.
Statistically speaking, a three-way quote is just 13 percent, four points (all from junior Johannes Patrick) for sage and writing 31 attempts - is that enough?
The answer was delivered by John Patrick: "We were just not focused enough after the victory at Teneriffa and we haven't implemented what we have been training for," he said.
So the ball.
His opponent, Sebastian Gleim, reacted quite differently: "A different game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It's felt like there were 10,000 people before."
On Saturday, there were only 750 spectators in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came to their cost.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team to victory.
The best player I have trained, said Gleim.
While in Patricks own team the performance scorers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) struggled on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Riesen prevent a total collapse and came up with only eight points, after which they already had 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to wait.
Already on Wednesday (19 p.m.) the skyscrapers received the skyliners Frankfurt, with a maximum of 750 spectators also in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have another email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I already reported it a few months ago.
All defense claims were rejected.
We had already discussed it in detail and written about it again.
We have already reported this half a year ago.
Always like from the egg: Max Raabe gets 59
He conjures up his audience with new interpretations of blows from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on the programme "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he should appear at all.
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig on Sunday.
But that's not enough.
The planned concert is postponed in May 2022 - "on conditional instructions" to curb the Corona virus.
Even other performances planned for the Advent season have to wait, as the website of the singer, who is now 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchestra.de) say.
From January, the artists want to collect their 2020 paintings due to the pandemic.
Max Raabe, born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, has been singing since he was a child.
He studied opera singing in Berlin in 1986, and together with his colleagues founded the Opera House.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of puns and songs in the style of comedian harmonists.
He was awarded a lot of money.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged"-Reihe (2019) - exactly like his success album "For Women is No Problem" (2013) - ranked second on the charts.
He has created it from the bottom up.
Max Raabe, from the contemporary German music scene, is no longer to be missed. Ever elegant, his blonde hair is tightly wrapped back and adorned with a ribbon, he is no longer to be missed.
With the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück", he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello, #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small memento of the furniture's age?
It is to be supplemented with existing furniture and so we may be able to control earlier whether it is bright
I still can't see the deck sheet though.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: There will be no new construction
The new Federal Minister of the Interior, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the implementation of large housing associations, as it has been demanded in Berlin by the people.
With an expansion comes no single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure, Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to provide peace of mind that your rent will be paid in the near future.
Private landlords, tenants or housing companies, for example, are usually the best defenders against a monopolistic image.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission to handle the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz will not close talks with the FDP in the coalition about further tightening of the housing law.
The coalition agreement provides for a subsidy until 2029, a reduction of rent increases in squeezed housing areas and the extension of the rent subsidy.
I will talk to the justice minister as soon as possible.
However, if the market does not collapse, "We will talk with the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and it has been happening that I have forgotten the last step in the payment.

That is absolute truth
At least 100 deaths from tornadoes in Kentucky
Numerous tornados have struck the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be claimed.
The pictures there remind one of a war zone.
On Saturday night in the US, several tornadoes caused severe damage and possibly killed up to 100 people.
The storms left a roughly 320-kilometer-long tail of snow, especially in the state of Kentucky.
His governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster zone, all but the tornado was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings - just gone.
Leaves of industrial plants, dächer are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that it's actually possible.
He alone in the state of Kentucky is expecting up to one hundred dead, official figures continue to rise.
Hello, I just saw that they are selling the #NAME# in the window.
That is very sad.
Will she still produce?
Or was she completely taken aback?
Is there the possibility to order this window in another country?
When do you register?
If the delivery is not possible in my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I can only order the shelves now and send them to Germany, is that right?
I had returned an article and received a refund, and I wanted to ask whether that was an anomaly or something to be done, as I haven't received a refund yet.
Companies pay compensation and change advertising
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for an impound payment, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and offered their employees for impound payment.
This means that they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the chambers of commerce, who today demand financial incentives for prosecution.
Even the design of advertising slogans should encourage people to get vaccinated - according to the German example.
He is changing jobs in a company.
That doesn't make her situation any better.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He did not even acknowledge his old position and searched for something else.
You can also do that.
And he didn't find it that good back then: not that great either.
He didn't find his job either.
There are too many variables.
Don't forget to claim the refund.
That would then be quite relevant.
I take a screenshot.

Help in the first campaign
Boron to the grave!
I am just about to embark on a group of four friends the treasure hunt over the threshold and I want to lead my friends into a special campaign for the players.
We played DSA 5.
The big waves have been made, the buoys and their motivation written down, and now I am writing down the first touchdowns on my own channels.
The premise is that the rescuers are to bring a wheelbarrow filled with supplies to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
Further action is to be developed there.
Some miles from the village, the aid workers are said to be facing a group of goblins and being chased by them.
I want to give the players the opportunity to lighten the pressure by confronting different facets: manipulating, acting, frightening, the danger of early recognition, which always happens to players.
Group strength: Eight normal goblin, two with spears, six with clubs and swords
In the background, the goblin dances with the help in a loop and flanked by three to the left and three to the right. The wheel stops while two with spears stop the wheel.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are under pressure, I have two solutions
(1) The rescuers found and killed the son of the roof school pupil, who had fallen to his death.
Of course, the car is gone.
If a defeat is unavoidable, this midfielder with two of his wits will strike and come to the rescue.
The car is still there, all super.
What stops her Deus ex Machina from solving the problem 2?
Is the encounter as a starting point too much?
The Goblin group will play a decisive role later, so it is not just Kanon fans.
EDIT: wow, I had not counted with so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee many of your ideas will be buried and I will now have more trust in my narrative.
I have built the lamp again.
And again hidden.
Unfortunately, it doesn't work anymore.
For this reason, I would still like to send her back
Can you then let the shadows come in, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I am a big fan of Sky Sport F1
Hello, hello F1 fans, over the past season the quality of the German sky has gone down more and more, so I want to make a little noise with this post.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted midway in the F2- race to start the F1- coverage at full tilt.
It was far back in the planning process through the delayed start and the postponement of the time plan, but one could still show the last ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!!) despite this.
It seems, however, that from a legal point of view the F1 world championship is enjoyed and therefore all other restrictions must be imposed, so that Sky DE will not have had a vote here.
However, despite this, Sky UK has been pushing ahead with the race.
However, there is one small consolation - the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has kept the difficult situation in a good way.
Then again, there was a new rule-breaking in F1 commentator Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, who did not know that under a red flag the stops can be changed.
Although there had been this situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that Verstappen should be allowed to change gears as appropriate, given the implications for Hamilton of such a move.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that this was the opportunity for Verstappen.
I think such elemental rules should just be known when you comment on F1 on a pay TV channel.
It is not the first time that there have been shortcomings in this regard, according to rules or proposed rules, both have simply been steady uncertainties.
In general, it does not appeal to the customized commentary style of Roos, but the taste is there.
But I prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL.
There are steady albionites who just look like unprofessionals, such as the order of coffee by (unaware) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Last, but not least, brings total stress to the comments he apparently doesn't take seriously.
Not least, the advertisement is simply overhyped on Sky, in which Sky is the only broadcaster in the advertisement, as you can see on F1TV, which only has the German ton without commenting directly after the race.
ServusTV or ORF?
These two networks are also doing less advertising than Sky, and less advertising than free-to-air TV.
One must wear gloves and safety equipment for their work, but that alone is not enough to see through the details.
The original Sky Sport F1 programme is also very strong and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster to transmit F1.
Unimpressive, RTL is doing a better job with the four races they still have over the next few weeks.
So, at any rate, the grandiose F1 season makes it considerably less fun than it could be with a neutral carrier.
I would like to have your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# Pendles, Messing and dangling glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that is due the last week and is still not delivered.
I contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady said Monday it would be delayed, and the second Lady said yesterday it would be sent and she had never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on December 12, 2019.
One of these has already been proven to have a defect for a relatively short time (the raw material has a loch on its front part).
I am seeking support.
Extra pumps are required to secure an aquarium additionally with sand.
It's also possible to run a filtersystem over the air.
This series is available in 3 variants.
Take a look at the end of the project in the table.
You can compare the performances there.
If the pump is too strong, all the equipment can be damaged.
If you own a large aquarium, Pumpen will be happy to have 2 or more visitors, so that you can finish them off.
The MK-series has one, two or four sockets, depending on the model, but also offers the option to add sockets in order to set up an accent in the aquarium, for example with a ceiling fan (you can find them in the shop) or with a decor which reflects the light pipes in a way.
Here would be a marble, shale or similar.
The MK series has a special, adjustable construction and provides so much for low operating costs.
The installation is very simple.
The thumbscrew is attached using a 4/6 mm airtight screw... and it can go wrong already.
The lid should be the same, or higher than the water level and displayed outside.
The shutters should be lower than the water level, so that a backdraft could be set up.
The noise simply disappears and the ventilation does so as well.
This would prevent water from running backwards into the faucet through the door...
If the lights are to be brought down in the open, so should you, as other lights are also covered and protected against fire
The Pumpen of the MK-series are true power packs that require little energy
Even if we give the processing time with 3 days, it will be packed daily and the packages will also be picked up daily here.
All goes well on the way, it's very fast.
We just want to reassure everyone that no one is going to be disappointed just because it took a little longer.
It would have been so, not everyone has sympathy for the entire staff who also work in the speedway... of course here no Corona halt.
Please do not judge me harshly because of the delay, which is mainly due to the postal service.
Of course, people enjoy these festivals, even if we are currently saying,... it has been difficult
This is also very regional.
You are not alone, you are healthy and we all hope that there will be better days.
How long does it take to order and receive with and without arms?
Can you also order the beads in hell?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronauts daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have made a short flight into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "Blue Origin" racetrack system of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
With a brilliant blue sky above, Bezos took the newly returned astronauts high up in the air.
Welcome back," Bezos said, opening a blue envelope as he unveiled Luke to the press.
Among the cheers of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers stood up and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were traveling at 10 minutes and 13 seconds per kilometer and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard, who became an Nasa astronaut in 1961, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were guests at the company, which had four other passengers for their tickets: roomate Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and their son Cameron.
How many times they paid for their tickets, Blue Origin did not disclose.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley recalled the mission of her father.
He worked hard in his matches and had to do everything himself.
She just laughed so hard, said the 74-year-old with a smile.
Even Michael Strahan was enthralled.
He would like to return to all of it, said the moderator.
New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometers high
The racket system "New Shepard" is widely automated.
The capsule, which was travelling along the edge of the comet, reached a height of around 100 kilometres above the Earth, at times with great difficulty, before it was eventually stopped by large rockets.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the earth as the boundary to the world. However, there is no internationally agreed upon rule.
It was already the third successful all-out flight of Blue Origin. In July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old New Zealander.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was there, who became famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy CEO of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of actively promoting the commercialization of outer space tourism without any scientific research interest in the well-being of humanity and without any regard for the climate.

Someone who works in chemistry or studies chemistry
I am currently studying Biochemistry in the first semester and I find the subject to be rather exciting and also challenging in the classroom (I have not had the organic chemistry practice yet).
I have of course already been informed about career prospects during the course of study, but I also wanted to study for the promotion and will do so.
But at the moment I have doubts, particularly concerning my job prospects.
On one side (Studycheck etc) one always hears superb scams and the profession is completely hunted down, on the other side one always hears of unemployed biologists and absolutely poor paid jobs.
Therefore, I'd be interested in that:
What is your current job?
(2) Are you satisfied with your work/work?
(3) What did you study/ What training did you receive?
(4) Do you want to do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently unsure and plan to study 2022, possibly drop out of school and take an apprenticeship in professional informatics.
If she has experience, she writes too:)
Extra stress before holidays and weekend
This topic came up last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to myself.
For now, just a letter.
Not only during holidays such as Christmas, there is a lot of stress in operation.
As it seems, there are also busier days before holidays.
It was like this: Last week was Mariä Himmelfahrt, who is called "arrived" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses do a bridge day, which is semi-official.
Last week there was a long four-day weekend at home.
What went wrong last week?
All stress.
Lauter E-mails, which are still out of reach, have an order here, an order there, all of it.
Why... because?
Because "then next week" sounds so much longer and that can't be it?
Or because people all want to go on a holiday this week as much as they do in a normal one?
Not only was I out on Wednesday, I was also very hungry.
What should this self-imposition be for?
How about having a day off when we can't treat you right?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all so independent.
My question is this: Are we all just like Switzerland?
Is this our reformative evangelistic art?
Or do you know it there too?
Yvonne Catterfeld celebrates Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is happy for Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she has no regrets.
The beauty, even if it should not give any snow in Erfurt, then you go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She agreed to meet up with her son Plätzchen, who was lying back and flat on his back.
I love it, said Catterfeld.
Up until the siege days, however, she still had something to do: "I had no memories at first, I now have to put it to rest."

Still not working
DDR construction model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, which was in service in Schlesien and Mitteldeutschland, is believed to have been used very rarely, probably out of the design concept of the model carner ME Heft 11/1968, which is a heavy goods locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn Company (DRG), which has been used for the traction of heavier coal cargo in the Schleswig-Holstein network.
There is a locomotive in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are capable of working on it
The Deutsche Reichsbahn Company had commissioned AEG in 1924 to design proposals for an electric locomotive that could carry 2,200 tonnes of coal on this 2,200-tonne track and carry 530 tonnes of passengers on this 530-tonne track with a speed of 45 km/h.
The speed limit was 65 km/h.
In March 1926, the DRG specified the delivery of the locomotive as 1’Co + Co1’ locomotive with gearbox-driven AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens brake plants with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives, numbered E 95 01-06, were delivered.
All of them survived the Second World War and found their way back to the territory of the late DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were repaired in the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany in November 1952.
In the state rail improvement works in Dessau, the construction of all six locomotives was completed.
In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were retrofitted, replacing the obsolete engines as spare parts.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 in larger numbers were built.
As soon as the E-94 was withdrawn, it was not possible to increase the number of construction workers, and the E-95 was put on hold.
First, the locomotives were stationed in the locomotive depot in Leipzig.
They came to Halle P. in 1960.
They were put into motion in a coordinated plan with Kohlenzügen from the ground level in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated regulation of the locomotives becomes increasingly problematic.
So it came off the top of my head that Schütze would never play again.
Then the man on this locomotive, who was constantly moving with a hammer and plank saw, had to loosen the seat again during the journey.
Accidents on the engines came first and led to a month-long failure of the locomotive.
[5] Since the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives available and it was not planned to extend the electrical network at that time, the German Railways was able to use the old locomotives and most of the splitter equipment, so that the E 95 was removed from service.
In addition, there was the problem that the Deutsche Reichsbahn Elektrolokomotives only wanted to install them one by one, which would have presented a problem with the machine and the view from the top.
After mid-1969 the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn, followed by the E 95 01, which quit service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 has never been used.
All locomotives were removed until the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was put into service as the replacement for the museum locomotive E 77 10 as a freight locomotive at the Halle railway station.
It took some time before the responsible people at the German Railways could convince themselves that the E 95 was a museum car.
In 1979, the first extensive construction of the locomotive began with the goal of being able to present it at a roadshow in RAW Dessau.
She has since been added to the Dresden traffic museum as a non-working museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior was completely renovated.
The locomotive is to be displayed in the Halle (Saale) Railway Museum.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have worked on the successful construction of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at the Arnstadt Museum Exhibition with a new inner and outer restoration, with the transformer having been inspected and five locomotives are capable of operating.
The locomotives stood on the Schleswig-Holstein railway until 1945, and the extending branch lines in use, where they awaited the completion of their reliable works and the reduction of maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were transported to the Middle East.
The main operation area was initially Schlesien
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, working well, optical maintenance is necessary in Eigenarbeit, installed with optical components, scratches, dents!!!, very rarely used Handicraft model, very small production volume, maybe also from the small construction company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
Packaging can reveal etiquette and provenance.
The F-elements are there
I received a book from Europe.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle shaft is kept from two feet. Unfortunately, these are too short and the shaft cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle shaft is held by two fences, which are unfortunately not produced.
The middle part does not fit into the existing halter.
I also receive new messages.
When will they be released?
No, not flat.
According to the production company, these are the correct measurements of the shape, they were only too good
But that's exactly what it is.
The main reason for this is to fulfill their purpose
For me, they are not flat
Could I get this delivered?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a house in Oberbayern.
On Sunday, the police announced that a major damage had also occurred in the six-story European region.
The fire had certainly been started from a carport on the outskirts of Kinsau (district of Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were taken to hospital with light smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was not yet known, but the police did not rule out a possible arson attack.
Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has resumed the investigation.
But it comes later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To combat fake news - Biontech CEO publishes impending photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first arrest in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Until now, Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not spoken publicly about his impending retirement.
Now the entrepreneur has released a photo showing his crown infection.
The illness of a friend has moved him, said Şahin.
CEO and co-founder of Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Şahin has published a photo that shows him receiving an injection against the coronavirus.
There were false information on social media that I was impounded.
In fact, my wife and I received three doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine, wrote Şahin on Friday in a contribution to the network "LinkedIn".
For some time, I have been waiting for friends to take a photo of me to post it, so I could rid myself of the false accusations."
So far, he has rejected it because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was really gutted when I realised that an old school friend is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not impressed, wrote Şahin weiter.
He did not ask for the reasons.
However, "the most common reason seems to be fear, which is often silenced by inaccurate information and misconceptions."
Fear lashes out only with facts, sometimes it's better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, there is an interview with the German broadcaster, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not impressed.
However, the video was released in December 2020, as well as the Deutsche Welle itself.
"Since I am not allowed to receive the fuel myself, I am currently not allowed to receive the fuel itself," said Şahin.
There is a prioritization in Germany when it comes to revoking the visa.
By now, the prioritization has long been lifted - and the Biontech boss has allowed himself to be three times impeached.
Fire out of control: Ten thousand people without power
In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday night: no more power and in many cases also no heating.
There was a fire at a gas station.
After a fire with serious damage in a power station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to remain without electricity for around 24 hours.
Through the fire, the tears flowed from 41,000 affected residents and residents in several communities.
The spokesman Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous traffic jams had been reported in operation, until the widespread disruption finally could be tackled late at night.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities are offering care places in schools and are calling for volunteers.
The sender expressed his gratitude to those affected for their patience and assistance.
We are very conscious that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also regret the affected communities, the district, the fire brigade and the THW for the unnecessary deployment," said the head of the field primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few days more, as the Westnetz-mountains will be able to resume their normal operations only temporarily, he explained.
According to company data, a technical defect led to the fire.
Power is back
According to information from Westnetz, the fire broke out at around 7.15 p.m. on Friday at the Neunkirchen power station, which is part of a 10,000-volt power plant.
There are urgent requirements for reinforcement and repair work there.
Parallel to this, a connection to a 30,000-volt spindle has been made.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 8 p.m. over 21,000 people have had power restored in Much and Ruppichteroth.
Further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen Seelscheid have been moved by 21.30.
Since 23.15 p.m. the affected power had also been switched off.
Over 80 Monteures of Westnetz and partner firms have been deployed.
The authorities had also called for help from neighbors after the construction of a sewage treatment plant for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
It is now important that citizens and citizens concern themselves with older or isolated people in their neighbourhood and share information with local fire brigade members when help is needed, explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU).
In the creation and operation of noticeboards and signs, the residents of the old monasteries were primarily concerned.
In addition, emergency services were deployed in schools for people who were not able to protect themselves, or for medical equipment that was required for medical treatment.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them in Euro?
It is about the sunset #PRS_ORG#.
I hope you have a beautiful day and stay healthy ♡
I can, however, not mount it on the table.
It's a custom #NAME#.
There are three inspections.
We wanted each one with a tabletop diameter of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
My #PRS_ORG# came today, but I can't send it yet and thus miss it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I should send them back, because they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive a reply
That's really easy!
Then we'll do it like that!
Can you send me the receipt by email?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not started the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find it almost unbearable.
So we are not convinced

Return of the order number #number#
When will the money come back to my account?
Yes, we both made and used the version 4.5...
It was possible that she had already been overloaded with problems
It seems that with my #PRS_ORG#, a book has also been bought.
If I could open it, I would!
This document may not be opened.

I must also work!
To ensure that the paint is evenly and cleanly applied, you should wipe down the surface with a damp cloth, paper towel or cotton swab with clear water and wipe it dry.
Before you start pinning the first time with a new color on the model, it is recommended to do 2 to 3 stripes.
You can no longer see the bottom of the fuel tank or a fuel cap on a later model.
The first line on the paper
Keep the pin on the same line as the tape.
Leichte Überlappung der Farbschichte sorgt später für eine gleichmäßigen Fläche.
Draw subtle strokes with the paintbrush.
This creates unrealistic spaces.
An example is not a pattern.
Start with the black colors.
The dark could have been spotted later.
Metallic tips and metallic shades come to the end with a separate pin.
Otherwise, it can get pretty ugly if they mix with normal colors.
One day before you build them, the parts that are stuck move.
The models are able to see through the decals or scratches on the glass.
From royal symbols on aircraft to ship names and engine numbers on automobile models: the decals give the model the last stroke.
Bring the decals in the correct order as long as the plywood is still well accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be cleaned or repaired before it is dismantled.
Even more important than the right tool is the right technique, patience and a relaxed hand.
Get rid of every decal and put them in the trash.
Decals are also called watermarks because you touch the backside of the picture right with water until the paper underneath is dark.
Then you just take a small piece of paper and put the piece on the corresponding position on the model (which you have already indicated).
While you are holding the decal on the model with a tool, you tear the poster paper away.
Attention: Inspects only to see if the picture is up to snuff before you tear it down completely, so it doesn't slip off your finger, knit or tear.
Undrugged water with a household chemical leak.
Attention not for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly once I start something else, then I can't read that book any more and have to quit and join and download and re-open it and look for the place where I read it.
On Saturday, I had already communicated with you.
Can I get this per email?
For all 3 packages?
Because the light bulb came in three separate packages for me
Thank you anyway!
Then I will buy something else whenever the money is gone.
But do I return the problem?
Child trafficking in PKV / What is a "confidence case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in child trafficking for a while, now as it relates to the payment with the PKV, it suddenly stopped.
The sequence:
We had applied for the adoption of the children at the PKV in the run-up to the marriage and received the refusal over 3 attempts.
The experiments were restricted in terms of scope (e.g. time frame, success, etc.)
The first attempt led directly to the successful birth and was corrected with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and after 2 (successful) attempts, we did not receive the PKV.
We once again submitted the costs of the PKV and received another three trials denied.
After several more attempts (we had more attempts than expected, in the face of the PKV, the most significant of which was that instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV wanted only 3 attempts), we reached the conclusion that the PKV wanted only 3 attempts.
The explanation: With the birth/breastfeeding, the remaining 2 attempts at the first feeding are lost.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to AGB, "the insurance event begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The experts are answering the questions:
Who has the right, the PKV (only three attempts are allowed) or we (five attempts are allowed)?
* The PKV has to point out to us that with a birth the further attempts will fail?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to blocked eggs) is not passed on to the first child.
It would have been super if the experts gave their opinion here.
Many thanks once again for your help!
Can you please get me the three variations and tell me how I find them best?
Okay.
We won't order anything from them.
If they add my sales and my friend's (same address) sales, they obviously lost good business.
They should be able to keep doing that with their managers.
That is not competition.
Last night the class told me the refund was made and now they say I have to send that thing back.
I can certainly do nothing to cause the dresser to completely break down for me
Please take a screenshot of what the class has written
It is clear and obvious that the withdrawal was fraudulent and I still have no withdrawal per #PRS_ORG#
You can set your manager to think she's lost two of her regulars.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We won't do that any more.
No, the defect has only appeared after a few months.
One burostuhl needs a normal use.
Otherwise, they cannot sell him as a citizen.
However, the 24-month contract is valid.
No, it is not possible to pack differently.
I will cut off the rope and put it in the hands of the transit company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional hooks, which we unfortunately cannot find for you.
Can you help them?
Thema der Woche: The best low budget films
What exactly is a low-budget film? There is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little or no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can listen to a wide range of low-budget films on the net, like on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What is the purpose of this?
And what does that really matter anyway?
Bin a very good client of Euch, having already completely furnished 2 homes with their furniture.
Wollte den besten Preis für das große Ledersofa Odelle erfragen.
The delivery was again delayed, is this still safe?
Many thanks
With friendly greetings
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing has changed about the ward position... I will then return again soon because it simply does not work here.
Hello
Half victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to the EU, in the conflict with the Belarussian regime, the political expert Raphael Bossong is an "expert".
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees in Belarus, "said Bossong to the press service (epd).
According to the Berlin-based Foundation for Scientific and Political Research (SWP), the EU has not stopped the confrontation.
This tight state of affairs - Belarus gives not quite enough, but the EU feels as if it is winning - is likely to go on for some time.
The handling of people on the border is not in line with the European human rights convention, Bossong said.
It seems that there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by single EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not seem to be resolved, this is on the cost of the fundamental rights.
This development also threatens the stability of the Union.
"She apparently can't get over the fact that a member state is trying to do something," as Poland, which is not even part of the EU border protection agency Frontex, is currently seeking access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its foreign policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong added: A basic agreement on asylum policy will be reached, as the line "boundary protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Repeated border crossings
According to Polish border guards, migrants have again tried to reach Belarus via Poland.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, said a spokesperson for the authority on Sunday.
Polish officials were accused by the migrants of throwing stones at them.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border protection registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had already crossed the border.
In recent months, thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU or attempted to do so.
The EU accused Alexander Lukashenko of being the mastermind behind Minsk's entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off border crossings.
The EU has banned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, the EU Commission is providing assistance to people in origin countries to prevent their movements.
The most important element of the EU reaction is the pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the abyss and exposed its resolve with tough border controls and extraterritorial sanctions."
Moscow also had to take into account political costs.
According to reports, the Belarussian society is not established that the security forces regularly arrest thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests controversial Formula One final
Max Verstappen is said to have broken two rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final at Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has taken advantage.
The silver plates show two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is centered on a supposedly reckless move by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he should have overtaken arbitrarily.
Another appeal was lodged against the award at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed as required.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and was quite happy with his first Formula One title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the drivers in front of him had overtaken each other.
I test that.
I speak to the bank and report to you again
Thank you for the support
Free entry for members: Europe Park is being prepared by SC Freiburg

As the park does, members and members of the sports club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community can visit the European Park this day for free.
There were also prizes for drinks and wurst.
The autumn leaves were lit up this day by the trikots, which were white and red.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons ensured perfect positioning, said the park.
Cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has been going well since the start of the 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa Park, it has once again shown how well the partnership is going.
Shining fans can be seen together having fun in the shade, says European Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is the €#NUMBER# and not 1699€?

She has been rejected, lives in a house on the coast and looks down sensibly at the night lights on her front door.
I gave the contact form to submit an article yesterday, but I didn't receive an email confirmation or anything.
My question would be whether my question has been answered.
It doesn't have the time for your annoying chat and wrongly delivered expensive goods from China.
Your mistake, which you overlook and not everyone from our household.

Tannen sale in Schönwolde: In the community of Krembz women are looking for the Christmas trees
Frank Diers has already experienced some curious situations when dealing with tanning.
Once a man is supposed to even be driven home without his partner because neither of them can agree.
He pplants for this every year.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a curious situation.
That makes the overnight time a bit more appetizing, he says.
And with the confidence???
Unless I am a customer?!
After all, I received a wrong delivery and now I have to pay the full price.
Then I will also evaluate this accordingly!
We don't need to debate about the better court here, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both are made from meat that is grilled in a fiery pit.
And both have their names.
In German, an equivalent could be "upright", which is often not so clear.
Troubles with Glasfaser + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new light bulb installed in our house for a couple of weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems with a stable WiFi network.
Prior to that, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which can handle up to 50 Mbit of download and upload capacity.
The new fiber-optic connection delivers 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan Modul, which is connected to the FritzBox.
However, on the other DLan Modul, which turns the Wifi on, not only the full 500, but also I keep myself in the house with the Modul, so that less comes (use a stack of doses, which removes 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms from the other Modul).
This means that the Internet with the new glass fiber connection is even slower now than before (~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set that seems to use a new technology.
This was slightly better than DLan, but also there were large losses.
Can someone explain to me why with a laser pointer so much Internet speed is "lost" through the power line?
And is LAN really the few solution?
It would be extremely helpful to have LAN cable in the house.
I am really nervous, I have only opened an account for this.
So I would be more than happy to hear an answer.
When is the time to change the tire
Whoever thought that now would be a good time to relax the Giro account, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to reassure their customers with any trick they can, negative interest rates, too, are falling.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, receives a limit of 100,000 euros as relatively generous.
Now she has halved her debt and even paid for it with her wages.
In a first step, the border was only closed to customers of the company's part of the Postbank - on 50,000 euros in cash and check accounts and 25,000 euros in day-to-day accounts.
However, these lower borrowing costs apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesman.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "updated individual agreements with suppliers".
The Commerzbank had already entered a cap of 50,000 euros before, which still applies, as does the ING Germany cap.
The just-launched direct bank DKB has reduced its deposit to two levels, from 50,000 euros to 25,000 euros.
After all: More than 100 banks have now agreed to a payment of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
Even the Sparda bank in Berlin has arrived at a price of 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance have appealed against this ruling to the Berlin Supreme Court.
Now it is being debated in the banks whether the institute should be allowed to draw conclusions - in the case that the upper houses also explain the negative conclusions at the root for unlawful reasons and that many billions of dollars are to be returned to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston occupies a whole beauty arsenal
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is full of climbing and hiking.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman in Hollywood by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, the success of 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" is in the first place the result of a lot of disciplines and work.
In order to appear, a whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers are on hand.
After all, so Aniston, she could wear a chip on the day (right, read correctly: an EINZIGE chip from the bank).
It is actually a wonder that her heart goes out to the female and male fans at the same time.
Perhaps because she just got lucky and is still in love.
And the baby wish list has grown.
Previously, she was asked when she will become a mother.
That hurt her.
People who questioned me have no idea what medical reasons are why I can't.
It was really painful.
Hopefully, success and prosperity will do well.
Unfair end to a career Räikkönen has to accept
Kimi Räikkönen's exit from Formula 1 remains a matter of time.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne put her hands up and winked at the crowd.
That's what it was.
After a lapse and a slight band aid, Räikkönen had to give up his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even reaching half the revs.
It was his 349. and last Grand Prix, which " Iceman" ended his career in the Motorsport class.
His wife Minttu and the two children also left the United Arab Emirates at the end of the trip.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix races, started 18 times on the pole and came to 103 wins. dpa
Friedrich Holt wins the 60th World Cup Championship - without taking a single shot in the second round - Sports
The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen's mark of 94 success is the target of the bob pilot.
"I had it calculated, I had to win the race for the season, then I could try to win the race for Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he only defended the attack of Johannes Lochner on five hundred thousand, in which he scored three goals.
Then he changed something in the material setting and set a greater advance on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team consisting of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer(BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he challenged Britain's Brad Hall.
The third person was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We are taking a greater risk today and are reaping the rewards, said Friedrich, who also scored his 22nd victory in a row.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who is driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth this time last time.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place in the first race.
If I knew what he was doing, I would do it too, said Lochner.
Without home victory - Podium for Jamanka
On her back, Laura Nolte picked up the third victory of the season on her beam.
After failing to advance to the fourth round at the Monobob the previous day, she raced to the world cup victory on Sunday with teammate Deborah Levi.
Zweierbob Olympian winner Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she secured the first place in this winter.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki finished in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, the first podium in the world cup, I am superhappy that Mariama takes me.
I'm super excited about the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but today's starting times were okay," said Burghardt, emphasizing that "this is not only advancement, but there is also a lot to do".
Jamanka joked a bit about the erratic driving, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the shelves in the store and I could now buy them!!!
What should I do?
I didn't even get him and I couldn't even start because I finally asked.
Last year I had other problems and never had time for it.
And now it was said that it had been released what I was very disappointed in.
Check the chat for the Asare Sitzbank.
I want to return it and then order again, because it's just reduced :)
Will the delivery be started on 16.3?
There was nothing of the kind on your website
No, I only get an extra field if I tip too hard
You were absent yesterday from your colleague.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we want the package to be unblemished, even a new one
And not the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely girls and women
I have a few things I just want to write down and maybe it's one or the other...
I am 24, have a PTBS, full-time student, and a dog mom - but I take it for granted that my dog does not bark or goes to kindergarten actually 1 to 1 with my child.
My friend (since 6J) is sick, had a burn 2. on Monday and has been depressed (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel him and it was nice.
I have reminded him about this (weil Hand ist in Verband wg Verbrennung).
He is very down-to-earth and we are currently seeing fewer (1 to 2 x week) things that make me very happy and fulfilled.
My dog has diarrhea, I bought him a food and he is now in his crotch and is feeling a little better after I used the dewormer and stretched for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and they are just apart for a month.
Now also housekeeping is coming to us, which we naturally share with you.
But cooking by myself is just too much work...
My PTBS illness is just getting better, I am halfway better and getting real.
Not good, but I'm coming right and I'm almost symptom-free.
My uni is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow I will have a written test I have yet to do and over the next hour and a half I will have an anatomy hour to prepare for.
And next week I have a medical examination on Tuesday, and then what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no more space.
My week goes as follows: just over a month, then it's the weekend.
But what happens after that?
Only until the birthday.
Just until the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And that's how it is.
I believe that I just need to be more stressed out, because otherwise I pack this much.
somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic" but I don't...
Is it also like that?
Honestly, I am extremely grateful that I don't have to work.
Thankfully, that can hardly be said in words.
You don't know whether I would have survived on my own.
I believe that this has something to do with mental load for women and so I thought I should look for mates here...
I hope you have a lovely evening and the week is almost done!
I received my order today, unfortunately, the whole other color plus the space is overstocked and the dining table has scratches.
The first delivery was exactly as described on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we sit down now, will I get another color or what?
The email to cancel the subscription was sent on December 26th #number#.
Two times.
But it was not confirmed.
There was nothing completely different back then: I remember that in school I found out that many religious teachers didn't believe in God and that it was only another subject like math or history.
For me, it always felt strange, maybe also because I had been made christian and I always assumed that.
How do you see it?
Maybe you can also talk to your colleagues at work or at school about this.
In principle, I think the difference between private and professional and it is easy to divide.
Is there any training plan?
But does it just happen that a physicist has faith in the non-relativistic theory?
What brings religion then?
Is culture dead or alive?
Answering the question is not private.
Can it not be changed? I also understand it well in English
That is too long, then I would look away
Is good, thank you.
I expect a reply by the end of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film Search Help
Hello people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (it's 24 years old).
I believe it was a film for young people.
There are two time zones in the film (or parallel).
At the other end of the spectrum, the modern (real world).
For example, the past (or the Reich of the Dead)
Without being able to describe it in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the Caribbean).
From the slightest cause, the path diverges and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Reich of the Dead who wants to bring the woman into this Reich to live her own life.
I also believe that the scene of the crime is the soldiers' barracks.
At the end of the battle, I believe both soldiers.
If that means anything, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has only slept on the stomach for 1 week.
Fast Forward: Live More: D
Relieve yourself.
So a child keeps more from than you think.
Remember that everything smells a little different, no matter what direction the scents are coming from, no matter how long you keep an eye on it.
That is amazing!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattresses.
No cuts.
Achso and our had no slumber, but always a blanket.
Obscured by your child's screams.
Is it the head on the side?
Can something come from the bottom?
Or is there something with the face directly in the mat?
This allows you to check whether everything is in order.
We are also all grown up and as a man, I have come to the world, there was a gang and it was like you put the kids up for adoption.
In addition, we have "stocks" for you and have already sold a lot of articles
But why are you only giving me 20 euros?
Hello, I have written to you yesterday and have not received a reply.
It is about my necklace that has arrived damaged (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The rightful inheritance does not fit the bill.
I would like to contact you as soon as possible.
The knife is not currently in use.
To be completely clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know that not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
All that is left is for the politicians of this party to get their act together and let this issue rest.
Almost every format is suitable (ok), but then you also need to go on a big tour.
It was said that you were a "non-independent" Internet provider.
Zitat Arno: One wants "no running jokes".
What is it now?
An 0815 phone number trying to sell his magic to the elite.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, for everyone, apart from Simon and Etienne.
Of course, more people can help.
One Krogmann lacks completely empathy and is trying to make a profit from the exploded rooms.
How do you feel about it all?
If it is right for you, I find it regrettable.
I want red hair, because my haircut is faulty.

Whether as a truffle on bread or just a crunch – My little friend is infinitely versatile.
Kirschkern-kissen are a traditional home ingredient for warmth-inducing meals, as kirschkern can be easily cooked and eaten again.
The visible cracks can easily be heated up in the microwave or in the back of the hand.
The bright lens makes the use particularly convenient, so that the small can feel secure even when it doesn't.
The Kirschkern- Kissen with Bezug is only suitable for the following application areas:
Prior to the warming of the kiss, check the type of scent, stains or burns, and notify the person immediately.
Please take care of the heating beforehand!
In the microwave at a maximum power of 300 watts for up to 2 minutes (as stated by the microwave manufacturer!)
Directly after the rise, the heat is equally distributed through the skirt!
Finally, the mystery solved.
The first applications can lead to a slight thickness buildup on the surface, but this disappears with repeated use.
It is absolutely essential to stick to the heating method specified, as long as it can cause damage in the long term or high energy consumption (risk of ignition and burning).
Before heating up the kissing in the microwave, make sure that the heating element of the microwave is approved by the manufacturer.
After the heated internal information was put back into the case, please check the temperature of the kiss on your arm (max. 43 ° C)!
You should not use it for acute and chronic illnesses, corneal ulcers, fresh wounds, blood clots and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced mobility.
For existing high blood pressure, heart disease, venous disease, diabetes or cancer as well as for vaginal dryness, see a doctor before use.
Should the necklace be open and expose the core, worry about it immediately and without delay for children.
If the product is used for babies under one year, the temperature of the child should be regularly controlled during use to prevent overheating!
All the cases that are connected with the product are the responsibility of the manufacturer and the local authority in which the consumer is resident.
The case is removable and works at 30 degrees Celsius in the machine.
Please note the product's symbol on the packaging!
Second place in Darmstadt after Hinserie in Düsseldorf
With 98 points, Darmstadt can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
At the same time, Hannover 96 is working from the basement.
There is also no third coach for Ingolstadt.
Jubel in Darmstadt after the late victory in the spitting game, happiness in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my network.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the network alone would also operate.
Fehlanzeige, the battery is dead and the laptop is no longer starting even after plugged in a component.
Then I cut the battery out, but there was nothing there either.
Have you had your ideas?
New battery is installed, but how can I use the laptop without internet connection?
Is there something wrong?
Many thanks for your help!
I want the delivery of #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I buy it?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# booth.
We don't know yet how high the sitting area is.....
On tour and still so much preparation?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
Up to 20 liter of luggage can also be glued onto larger photo equipment without problems, which can be sure to be securely fixed with the sturdy foldable pieces.
And what else do you need on daily occasions, thanks to practical attachments in the individual configurable indoor space, which are well organized and easily distinguishable from the photo opping.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to the version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
With the Everyday Backpack-series, Peak Design has created some of the most innovative solutions for protecting the interior of a rucksack, while still allowing quick access to the photography equipment.
This works with two methods: Once conventionally through the card slots, which can be locked with the mag latch closure system, a brilliant solution for effective protection, which has already been tested in the messenger bags.
Inside the zipper pocket, there is a slippery shackle made of metal with corresponding anchors at the front of the rucksack.
In contrast to most rucksacks, Peak Design has thought of various "fillstations": there are four anchor bolts, which can be stabilized with screws.
If the bag is full, just take the top one, it's a bit bulky, a bit heavier.
Clamps and hinges are also magnetic.
Thus, the bag can also be secured securely without the handle.
The second option, on the other hand, also differentiates itself from everyday backpacks by other manufacturers, Fotorucksäcken: Besides the zipper pocket, there is also a key compartment on both sides of the rucksack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of access from above - you don't have to look any more!
At the same time, this simple detail raises the level of detachability of the bag enormously: If you don't only take your photo, but also everyday items or a travel bag,
In the everyday backpack, you can individually configure the interior space (more about this here) and separate them both easily - and through the two newly opened windows, you can also independently access them.
You can also remove the rucksack from the right side of the car before removing it from the front of the car, for example to access the camera lens on the right front wheel, while the daytime running lights will stay in the left front wheel half and not otherwise.
Bequeme, uncomplicated concealment help.
And since the pockets of the rucksack are also completely recycled, wetter and stronger nylon has been produced, the content itself will then change when it is going to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I had forgotten the email from his support.
#NAME# sent me an email confirmation for the submission of the
Contact has been established with regards to the removal of the false information.
I haven't received any news so far.
I am seeking immediate response.
I am now writing to the third supporter, and I have yet to receive any confirmation beyond my expectation.
It is about the return of the falsified Custom #NAME#
It is therefore beyond doubt, when the stroke could be delivered again?
It is not an option for me to keep you...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
Wishing you a beautiful evening
Hello, my order number is #number#. When will the item be delivered?
Delivery and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was sent a completely different light than I requested
Please call me
If you give me the guarantee, I will give you a larger order, but I will keep the damaged piece and not return it.
And I couldn't bring myself to think that last year was any different than the year before and that it could have been resolved in a different way.
But the damage was as a customer and I didn't accept that.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shattered the history of the Westküste.
In winter 1848, a man discovered a rockfall on the southern bank of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the novelty spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from Nah and Fern and made Coloma one of the fastest and most floriferous cities in the state.
Witnesses said that they were hiding, shooting at each other, and burning down saloons and hotels almost overnight.
Everyone wanted to take their share of the country's power.
For many, it was: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrupt)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who is searching for a name in the West.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, transport horses, and build companies.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding river flows and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to meet your pioneer colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with them.
Coloma is a clever strategy game with a lot of reasons to win.
You are simultaneously choosing your actions, you have to keep your resources in check and build a table that will work for you "more and more".
The buildings on your map allow you to be more efficient, to receive additional actions or to give rules to your liking.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plinths, you can develop your individual playing style with easy adjustments.
Coloma played for a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California sought official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players choose a location on the game plan on which they can carry out actions.
Afterwards, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneering efforts at the relevant locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a reprieve!
This deactivates half of the site - thereby reducing the possibilities for actions there.
Then the players switch off activities such as winning resources, driving cars, setting up snakes, searching for treasure, building bridges, opening shops and placing revolvers.
If all campaigns are cancelled, the pioneers will return.
The prospective buyer takes every round to a new location and thereby changes the existing actions.
This goes on for as long as the bidders move five times, so each place is covered once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players Coloma have to defend themselves from a vicious gang.
If the players have taken enough revolvers and paid the robbers regularly, they will receive their wages.
However, if they fail, they will receive a lower rent or be forced to leave the property.
The game ends after the third shot, then the final score is announced.
The player with the most points wins!

Why children are not tyrants Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentation is now in my Twitter timeline, and I have just added it.
The children's psychologist Michael Winterhoff is enthusiastic guest at talk shows and holds European-wide contracts.
With his book "Why our children will become tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate about education.
Former patient: Inns and education rights are now being raised against him.
Please pass on to the EU that the film is difficult to make.
And I am very grateful that so many people are now thinking and acting differently.
Our parents and other responsible people should never take power over the child!
Our goal must always be to give the child the freedom to develop as a child and to make the child's role so great that it is possible in the situation.
Brrr, I still feel itchy.
Holetschek: States complain about test obligation for three-in-a-row
The health ministers of the states want to decide on their next meeting on a national roadmap for the implementation of three-pronged measures on their next meeting.
We need clarity quickly on when and how the test obligation can be imposed, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, in the "Bild am Sonntag".
The rollout of 2G plus for triple play is "not only medically justified, but also provides an additional layer of protection," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has said that "he will make a submission to the ministerial conference next Tuesday". − AFP

Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# seat very nice, but I can't see how high the seating area is.
Can you please help me?
I can't wait to see my #PRS_ORG#.
Report: Ups, it's an error.
Visit to the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated the data.
Can it be placed?
What you describe as *Awareness* is called *Sense perception*.
These occur with a frequency of ca. 1 to 1000.
The most common reason for visiting a doctor is for the care of minor ailments, such as hives or a sore throat.
For this topic relevant: Kaiserschnitte are operations that increase awareness at a very high rate, so as to protect the child until the termination of the pregnancy.
Relevant episodes from Awareness should be mentioned at the Narcotics talk.
Fixed anastomoses such as total intravenous anastomoses (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT** Love all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but had **Nitemarex **per definition no.
Is their comment wrong?
The chair is faulty.
We can't help the 20 euros either.
Those are statutory employment guarantees.
The absolute minimum would be to return the mistaken seat.
This is also standard in the eCommerce sector.
Please check again if they at least return the defaced seat.
We then sell the second seat privately.
We also lose money.

Another question.
In the order and billing, the goods will be delivered to a room in my choice.
The freight company is #NAME#.
I'm just there.
He told me that they only deliver to the front door because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If that is the case, I must cancel the order as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture in the first stock.
So I didn't call?
I had a question formulated
Theater historian Günther Rühle dies at 97
He has become a theater critic and an administrator.
Later, he wrote a monumental theatrical history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle, 97, died.
There is still the new book on the table, crunchy: "A man will be a man."
The disturbing diary of a long-lost farewell to the world, led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the letter is the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book says: "I have already paid my debt here."

Where there are still Christmas trees in Lübeck
For many people, gans or ente are part of the Christmas celebrations like the tannenbaum and the presents.
Have you packed your flight yet?
The time is running out.
We promise you that you will still find a Christmas tree in the room in Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a Röhrenendstufe is particularly important for the warmth and retention of the armoured sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the valve reactor control.
With the volume, gain, and master volume control, you can set your vocals individually for emphasis and others for the background noise.
In addition, the boost of the VT+ series provides an individual POWER LEVEL REGULATOR, with which you can reduce the speed pedal without changing the gain and the offset.
Further up, it has already been said that one can even float a reserve performance with the POWER LEVEL REGULATOR, if it is not exceeded.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL REGULATOR, the entire potential of the VT+ Series can be used in any situation.
The ticket vending machine can also be used as a line exit.
This signal will be processed with a box simulation so that you will get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression when using a microphone or when taking pictures.
The AUX port can be connected to a CD or MP3 player, so that you can jam your favorite songs.
There is also a tuner function on board - you don't need a separate battery.
Anyone who spends an additional VFS5 footcaster, which can also be used to summon the Sounds per step, alter the effect size and change the tempo of the correspondingly compatible effects.
This is absolutely unforgettable for live performances.
With its new packaging, VOX takes another step in the future!
However, this is not the case with others.
Is there then a chance to return the lamp?
Is it too low for her to sit on?
I would also send her back.
Can you help me with this?
And the wardrobe?
Will we receive another update in the next weeks?
Hello, are they already on the #PRS_ORG# stages?
If it doesn't work, I'd be happy with a keyboard or a mouse.
Among other things, I find a participant for the furniture.
I don't need more than 1,000 euros for goods then.
I received my order promptly and should have known that the screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (Tür) at the proposed height.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting period has not passed
Is there a premium customer status at Euch?
Iran sees progress in negotiations over nuclear deal
According to Iranian sources, progress has been made in the negotiations on restarting the international nuclear agreement.
Both sides are standing just above the issues that should be on the agenda on Sunday, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on news agency Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development," because at first there was no agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the renewal of the association were continued for almost an hour.
Parties to the negotiations include Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia.
There is also an US delegation in Vienna, but they are only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen overtakes Saxony - now federal state with highest Corona infection rate
Thüringen has broken the state record and is currently the nation's highest offender.
As the only federal state, the value of the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only state in Germany to be left behind when it came to the Corona outbreak on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported that the seven-day value with 1025 new infections was 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always been the highest income in the country, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thüringen was low, but there were also over 1,000 cases.
In Thüringen, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths in connection with an infection were reported in a single day.
On Sunday, 200 severe cases of Covid-19 were treated in intensive care at hospitals.
Weekends can be jam-packed.
In addition, health officials have been overwhelmed for weeks and are coming to terms with the discovery of new cases hardly any further.
That's what I'm saying.
Since delivery is only scheduled for early March, it may be possible until then.
I must put it down and shrink it and mail it to the post, what?
Do I have to do anything else here?
Exactly what I want to avoid, so I write to you.
I would like to take responsibility for my own costs.
I have an eye for a bargain.
It's time for changes
Thank you for coming, I am u/StratorDE in the Plenary Hall of Europe on a fantastic day!
Where is the post?
If you can trace the activity in the past few months of the Bundestag, you can also say: It isn't there.
We arrived in a winterstart and extended our swimming season to several months.
What is the problem?
Yes, where did it happen?
Most likely, this will simply relate to the disappointment, as some things have failed and as we generally stand here.
Over the last few days, it has become increasingly clear that many here still have bottles on the MB day.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is being asked what it wants to keep alive.
The push came from u/edizVEVO, which has been highlighting the project in recent days and has found a simple advertisement.
Several people from the community have joined forces to revive the project.
However, I would like to once again appeal to all to take part, just as this project can have a chance in the future.
We have set up a discussion platform in the form of a discord server where we can discuss and work on specific issues.
The server can be accessed via this link.
Purpose:
How will the MBunday function in the future?
What orders must be changed or adapted?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be introduced?
How do we create a fair voting system?
I am pretty sure that I have forgotten something, but that is not bad, because we have the Discord at the end of the day.
If you have passion and time, join the discord, work with and decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade so that it will be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/big for my taste and not suitable for my taste.
For this, I have already issued another notice.
I put it together and then realized that I was losing my seat.
Very sad.
I hope this is resolved and I have full compensation.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
There is one more question: the daydream #PRS_ORG#, is there the same size as, for example, 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# should still be able to guarantee that the fault will be addressed in time.
And I ask you to leave now.
I didn't have a designated package, so I was able to dispose of it promptly for disposal - they had to call #PRS_ORG# to figure out how it worked.
#PRS_ORG# can always contact me by phone to agree on a deadline.
Is there an instruction for the installation?
How long had I been worrying about this and deciding on the return?
How does she respond to the question of whether she is vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague who I value.
She herself has been vegetarians for a while, which is probably very seldom.
I myself have been vegetarian for a few years now.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan and whether vegetarianism has been planned, I honestly answered without thinking much.
And, of course, I longed for me to support the animal farm, but at some point I realized that I was also supporting slaughter.
For this reason, my decision to be vegetarian.
In the moment I had the impression that she was mad at me, she defended veganism and said she knew where her meat comes from and that reducing meat as a diet would make you ill.
Now, I wonder if my answer was "flat."
How does she respond to the question?
Does that make you feel like you're being put in a corner and coming into conflict without even asking?
It greets a harmonious vegetable (;
It does not involve an exception to section 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# is not bound by the statutory guidelines for mobile coverage.
I am at the correct date, my response has not been delivered to the site yet.
Since I cannot go to the store because of a dispute, that too unfortunately cannot be changed.
May I be referred to an alternative facility?
From 01.02.#number# I will be meeting again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr für Wasserretention gerüstet: 45,000 Euro Zuschuss vom Land
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatine Interior Minister Roger Lewentz in the Lahnsteiner Municipal Council approved a subsidy of 45,000 euros for the new water treatment plant at the Feuerwehr Lahnstein under mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounts to 135,000 euros.
Investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatine supports us here, says Mayor Peter Labonte of Lahnstein.
The vehicle is being used by the Lahnstein force, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatine.
They fill tasks in water and sewage treatment as well as the technical treatment.
In Lahnstein, one consistently receives high levels of interest: The boom in the tourism industry on the Rhine and Moselle rivers and the increasing use of the lake as a leisure river also contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of it and then they ran into the problems.
I can't open the book.
However, they have synchronised, deleted and reloaded the app NICHTS has not worked.
I'm a little frustrated because I've been spending a lot of time on the whole initiative and I hope to get help now.
Okay, then so is it.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRSORG# in June.
Can I set a reminder in the order process?

Thank you for putting the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in state service in a similar capacity, I was a weapons handler on the front line, I didn't want to go any further!
The question of right and left always fascinates me.
In principle, on the other hand, one should say that of course the state service comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, in the special uniform and weapon crews, people with right-wing magical inclinations should also seem to be on the receiving end, that is to say, that these people should then of course be able to deal with the presented reality, that is to say, that they should be able to deal with the presented reality, because of course, in addition to the average white, many Germans with migration background, women, and homosexuals (and so on), there are also many people with a migrant background, women, and homosexuals (and so on) and these people can and should I leave them, because in doubt, they should save your life or give it to you.
But even these small groups also reflect my experience after a conservative approach, proudly boast about Germany and feel discouraged by overly ambitious left-wing politics, even if that politics promises to put them for them, and they want to be treated just as normal.
Back to the rights, of course, as police and courts will also have a slice of the society, but they have extreme rights to say whatever they want there, and even to smuggle out any state-sponsored plans.
Of course, there is the risk that even policemen and soldiers, who were often in the foreign service, will start to panic and even say things that are controversial because they are politically incorrect.
There is also the risk that certain right-wing extremists will come to the conclusion that this is a gesture of thanks.
However, I think it will be well received and also with political education and clarification!
Germany is so internationally oriented that this is also good for us, according to my opinion, because we cannot have real racist and Nazi elements in our ranks!
Yes, I also ordered the other cake on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I called, it was not sold.
I have already ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I have previously used #NAME#.
Alternatively, one could bring the other #PRS_ORG# orb for #NUMBER# euros back to Germany or is this orb also available in Germany.
I only see you as a partner company.
But there are two small caves on the edge of the mountain, which are filled with something
and on the mirror itself is a small crucifix
Regular through kid?
Hello, I'm (w32) busy for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized (I am self-employed, very few freelances), but I have lived for my whole life and I have seen more bad things happen than good.
There are always phases where everything stays in place, and then and when it hurts and I close my eyes.
But it is never the case that someone could come at any time.
My husband is (sorry) not much better, he just generally loses interest in work and boredom.
The kitchen is still being built on a regular basis because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you found it normal to get along with children?
We still have to work under it, but this question has been occupying my mind for a long time.
For me, there is no shame in that, it just doesn't bother me as long as no one visits and so on.
Have you ever had a crush on a child? Or have you always been shy?
Thank you for your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-esteem disorder?
I have made a training in the field of software development and have been unsuccessful for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am always getting more expensive that this benefit is not the right one for me, for which I have been avoiding to start again and to study social work again.
The problem: I have a self-indulgent (e.g. anxious) personality disorder (AVPS).
This means that I do not have a personal opinion and therefore avoid conflicts.
I don't have a problem with talking to people at a reasonable level, but it gets very difficult to hold a meaningful conversation and I was already told I was unnecessary (which I already believe).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a streetworker or in the open youth scene, but rather for example job training or family help.
I do not know whether the actual working day is really like what I imagine for it, and it is difficult to find something online.
The AVPs are already causing problems in my job already (for me, emotional), because it keeps coming up when something is wrong with my code ("just the most annoying things") and it makes it hard for me to ask for help from my colleagues ("I'm going to find out for myself now, how it is going to be done / I should stop asking for help from my work / he has to help me a lot more" etc.).
I will probably have had problems, but I wanted to mention it at the appropriate time.
Have you kept the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation for this.
I was looking for a date for release
What do you want me to do with it?
If I have loaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message will be I #PRS_ORG# authorised this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery for my shopping list.
The protein provided by the fowl's egg (protein) is fed to the chicken in its gizzard, where it is broken down into individual amino acids and used by the body to produce its own protein, which it also needs for growth.
The image of the nestling and the feeder change are extremely complex events that are connected to the overall structure of the animal with a particularly high significance.
Please note that NEKTON- Bio cannot be destroyed during the search, as it can cause disturbances in the raw material process.
In the follow-up to this nutritional gift of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral compound preparation) should be resumed.

Have you received this email?
Statements of a member of the community in support of the settlement
Hello r/legaladviceGerman,
I have this problem.
On our property, a walnut tree is to be planted.
Also filed a complaint against the municipality.
One employee writes to me that the fall of trees and the loss of their leaves is not included in the calculation.
However, the walnut is explicitly stated to be to be protected as a tree.
Can I trust the employee's statement now?
On the one hand, I have to rely on experts.
On top of that, the bill is already clear.
Thank you for your answers
We accept that.
Then we'll use these new packaging.
I have not received a message
Naja, then I still had a sofo without use.
Could you lend me a pen or a pencil?
What was the matter?
Yes, that's what I believe, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have my tax refunded to Germany
Can you check it?
Road accident: Heavy traffic accident in Selb
Recently, there has been a heavy traffic accident on the St 2179 between the junction Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police press alarm is currently breaking (2:03 PM), a car has crashed into the oncoming traffic.
There are injured people.
Ah okay.
Thanks a lot, then, for once again letting it go!
Rat and ideas to further career
First of all happy New Year!
My Christmas is unfortunately boring because my head is just buzzing with everything I can think of that one can think of.
Before I leave now... for a while: I need a rat and, above all, people who know something about my situation - of course, euch.
I'm just doing the rewriting as an editor.
Originally, I studied something else and worked there as well (at least a little anonymously, I don't mind that much).
But then it was too long and I gave up, thinking about alternatives that could make things more fun.
At some point I landed at the school and was sure that it was - even though the conditions were clearly less flexible than in my previous job, that didn't matter to me.
I'm now at the third "Google other phone numbers".
And it's only half a year now.
In the meantime, I have always decided to continue doing it and at least finish it.
But I am absolutely exhausted.
Last month I had so little free time that I completely exhausted myself.
Now that it's summer, of course it's vacation, but there's still a lot of work waiting to be done on me.
I always thought I was stressed, but my weekend was also my weekend and my holiday my holiday.
I was free.
And the stress on the job was equal at the time.
Now I myself am suffering from too much stress.
And then these structures stand there, which I add to.
In principle, it makes it fun and from outside it also looks good, which is how the feedback is also treated.
But I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can handle before it completely hurts - if it doesn't already do so.
I wonder whether I wanted to do the rest of my working life there - precisely when I had some contributions to read here - or whether I should have gone back into the old area, where I had been judged suitable for free time when I needed it, and the work was, somehow, long overdue, but it was paid fairly and worked together in a team, and not as an individual, which is now the case for the vast majority of cases.
But then I ask myself if I haven't arrived at the same place in a year and aren't satisfied now.
You think it's all a bit weird, but maybe you've been a secondary judge or an ideologue, like I was out of this situation, which I completely finished and almost forgot about.
I'm not making decisions emotionally right now, which is probably leading to nothing good.
But perhaps your views will help light at the end of the tunnel at least - or celebrate Christmas that reaches me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and for forgiving my sinful behavior.
I hope that at least my situation has been clarified.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has continued to develop steadily, leading to the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" control, which allows the behavior of a valve regulator to be perfectly reproduced.
With the VT20X/ VT40X/ VT100X Amps, we are introducing a brand new modelling engine that is absolutely at the cutting edge of technology in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the hardware and the amp settings, the VTX boosters are waiting for an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also contain the more commonly available Valvetronix solenoid valves.
This is partially due to the fact that these are the pitch variations and nuances of a real piano, so they are easier to get used to than any simulation.
In addition to this attenuated sound, the VTX amplifier also offers a closed room and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only barely echo.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct historical facts on the virtual level, even move them up and down, so that they sound the way you always have imagined.
The perfect combination of Röhren-Sound with modeling technology is at the heart of the 2001 VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Obviously, it has been repeatedly revised since then, in order to accommodate even new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix Series in 2010 - with more dynamism and numerous and decisive improved boost models.
From the handheld VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed to make all riders feel at home.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and the dynamism of a tuner. They expect a hollow sound, a nuanced release of tone dynamics and Saito's aggression, and a prompt response.
During an ongoing analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that, above all, the endstoppers determine the strength of a lever and developed the VOX valve reactor technology based on this principle.
The Valve Reactor Control of each VT+ accelerator forms the behaviour, which subtly modifies the sound character and the tune of an accelerator.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it will not be enough to defeat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite losing 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven rebounds from his older brother Moritz on Saturday 104:106 against the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main facade is also adjustable: with three individually adjustable plazier- and fittbare Klettverschluss- elements, it goes all the way back to the need for your photo editing and is thus suitable for any kind of cameras - from simple system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror-reflex cameras.
What is ultimately in the pocket, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the objective.
One possible replacement would be a DSLR camera with an attached fixed objective, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a zoom lens.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fujifilm X-T2 leave room for additional objectives.
One can also buy a lot of supplies.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use it for your equipment and for things that require photography.
Even drone pilots choose the Everyday Backpack 20L as their optimal choice, because the rucksack offers a lot of space for a DJI Mavic Pro, including storage and accessories.
Vulkan eruption on La Palma: probably longer history
In the almost three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flow on the caldera has caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With an extension of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been ongoing since Sunday, the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 has been described as the longest on the Atlantic coast of Africa.
There are no conclusive data on earlier harvests.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja had decreased in recent days, but volcanologists did not predict when it could end.
The indicators show a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island region, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to state TV station RTVE.
Damage in millions
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the more than 1,000-degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 buildings and other structures, as reported by RTVE.
Just under 1,200 hectares have been covered by a thick lava flow.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 people had to be evacuated, with damage estimated at more than 9 million euros.
Two new cities were created on the coast, with a size of about 50 hectares.
The severe damage was mainly caused by the banana planting, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectare banana plantations were destroyed, other areas heavily infested, the newspaper "El País" wrote.
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is right around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for it.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have been associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the treacherous tension.
Thanksgiving is one of the few traditional holidays that keep our increasingly fragmented society connected.
It is all the more important to be aware of the holiday tradition of the skeletons, so that the gestures of the skeletons, which according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss were a "firmed social contract between civilized peoples", can be interrupted and filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How the Christkind was born
The protestants were very strong, by which the Weihnachtstage was reduced to the poor.
On the other hand, on the Nikolaustag, there were celebrations for the one or the other kind.
The backdrop to this legendary tale is that the holy Nikolaus, as Bishop of Myra, threw three women in a night into their windows to spare them another life in Suse.
From this unconventional art of concealment came the demand in Germany, especially for children with disabilities.
Protesters are relying on this need, because they are abandoning intermediaries between God and humans.
For this reason, she rejected the institution.
Martin Luther christened Nicholas and established a new tradition line.
The focus of the visit shifts to the evening.
As most protesters do not see the need for such detail questions anymore, it only reinforces the few that the need for the holy Nicholas is still a part of the pre-Christmas celebrations.
Today, in the town of Stiefeln, one can find oneself in front of the town hall and under the Christmas tree, all the way up to the coveted luxuries.
Various traditions in Christian countries
Records keep a tradition of the feast of Saint Nikolaus since the 13th century.
With the Reformation came the day of fasting at night.
In all christianised countries, however, there is a fröhlich Kuddelmuddel over the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the particular region, whether Christkind will appear on the Heiligen Night or the Father Christmas, who is essentially a kind of Nikolaus, depending on the time.
This includes, for example, his whiskers that are just a little bit longer than the rest of his face, his smooth skin that is shaded in shades of red, and the hood that covers his head to get to his houses.
In the Netherlands, the holy Nikolaus remains the central figure at the Christmas festival.
In Spain, the holy three kings are giving the gifts, while in Italy the sick child is leading the way to Jesus Christ.
In Scandinavia, on the other hand, fairs bring gifts, while in Russia there is a tradition of bringing gifts with frost.
There are no tenants here, but three horses that are drawn as a truce by the truce.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars, Christkind is responsible for the distribution of goods.

Police arrest suspected bank robbers near the royal palace
On Saturday, near the Kensington Palace in London, a concerned man was shot by police.
Police said there had been a report of a man carrying a gun into a bank and raiding a bookstore.
According to the authorities, the man is fleeing in a vehicle that was later stopped by officials.
There were shots fired and the man was hit.
He was subsequently declared dead.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
There are several messages attached to the Kensington palace.
The palace is the official residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Further members of the royal family live there.
So what?

Pill problem
Hello sweetheart,
I hope I did everything right, after a year Reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I had to take the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredible pain during the period and I had PMS before the period.
Now I will gladly stay silent again, because I have to take medication that I cannot afford.
My main problem, unexpectedly not the pain, but my stomach.
I had gotten into my last about two-and-a-half years of 0 on 100 explosive picks and that was all.
I was so excited, but I have a stomach bug and I didn't feel it.
In the past two years, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Perhaps there are some tips to avoid this.
My cosmetics are free from perfumes and without scents, but maybe that's what can make someone happy.
The female doctor took me so seriously and made me an appointment with a psychiatrist.
Many thanks to everyone who read the book!
Yes, the love is so true.
Getting a good night's sleep is crucial for good mental health, then a bit of calmness, then lots of stretching and the belly button.
I have also tried everything possible for my heart disease, and have been on milk, cheese and fish emulsion, because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It can also be good that hormones are simply the beast, but if you want to stop looking like me, you won't want to look any further either.

110 kV overhead cable will be built in 2022
The approval for the transfer of the new high voltage cables to the tannery is legally binding.
The government of Niederbayern has approved the construction plan, which is to begin in 2022.
This is what the Internet service provider Bayernwerk announced.
The approximately seven kilometres long cable will connect the power plant Tann in the north of the district and the existing 110-volt power connection between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is attached to a mast near the town of Edermanning in Reut.

Ref: Training plan (EK)
Hello colleagues and colleagues,
I have been studying in the summer camp, which makes me happy, but I am currently struggling to plan my lessons in the field of ancient history.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so I can use the table, the textbook and an OHP as medium in principle.
In the school, I can also copy (for free) s/w.
I need to plan my hours very long now.
We are discussing, for example, the topic of geofactors and I am actually there every single minute.
In principle, the methods are repeated again and again, but otherwise I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need it for UBs).
I am actually always planning from the point of view of learning (what I want to achieve), and then I plan how I can build it (I usually create a work sheet with text from books that my school does not have).
We have read the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
So the workstations.
Maybe one day I will be able to work with a historian like you, who can work with the book.
I would be very happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would really appreciate it if I could withdraw the withdrawal as quickly as possible.
The trade is threatened by the 2G regulation.
In most businesses, only those who are sick or elderly are allowed to work.
The trade is pointless and complains about overtime.
He also proposed a possible solution.
The 2G regulation, seen from the perspective of the trade association Germany (HDE), threatens the importance of the Christmas business.
In businesses with goods that are non-returnable, Umsatzeinbrüche have to be filed, criticised HDE chief executive Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE, more than 70% of companies below 1100 employees looked down on the rest of the year.
Many had already written the Christmas business.
What really should be the positive point of the year is now often a lake without bottom, said Genth.
In the past week, dealers with 2G access restrictions have lost almost a third of their business.
It only takes place in the life insurance industry and online.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with the mask, the distance and the hygienic concept is a sure thing, said the chief executive.
He stressed that "2G brings us no further in the fight against the pandemic."
The current rules devastated customers and required high personnel investment.
He called for the ban to be lifted nationwide.
After that, all customers would have to be controlled on 2G (by beep or by touching) and all businesses would have access to this data on this day.
In addition, in the individual market - as already in public traffic on the 3G regulation (imposed, hidden or tampered with) - licence plate checks should be abolished.
Even the specialist real estate group Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas.
The frequencies last without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre- Corona level, and at around 90 percent.
These numbers will certainly fall in the middle of the so important Christmas shopping season," said Wilhelm Wellner, Chief Executive Officer of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative requirements, the Center will try to find solutions and be approved.
This includes so-called binge drinking, in which "visitors can, for example, carry their 2G credentials to a central location in the Center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to that of a club hotel - can disrupt all businesses." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The paper has a cravat and on the waistband is also a mistake that was attempted to be cascaded with flour.
It looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have it packed and sent again.
How can I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is built for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high luminance.
For setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities is needed.
In addition to the reduction of heat, there are two standard light temperatures: day and night.
It is also possible to manually adjust the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K and to save it.
Use the current settings in the Flash storage.
One of the special marks of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive.
The light emitted creates a very bright light beam with a high quality of light, completely free of color.
The 120-degree shine, which you can squeeze into relatively little space, is astoundingly bright.
Especially in small spaces or in confined areas.
They can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool to work on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 - controller allows the highest possible sound level in television studios or when the sound level is too high for certain locations.
At the back of the charger is the control panel, consisting of tests and a lit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for the NP-F account (not included in the delivery)
Inducer storage The storage has up to three panel installation for light and temperature.
In order to access the settings of the individual settings on the storage plugs, one simply has to press long on one of the plugs and terminate.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching, so that the known situation is restored when new switches are inserted - very practical when working in the studio, for example, when the camera is set to specific lighting temperatures.
Work with battery one of the largest strengths of the DL3120 functionality comes from the possibility of operating with small NP-F batteries.
These are often owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can take a look at the existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check beforehand whether the battery has enough power - it is a battery tester that is identical with built-in - for each of the two battery compartments on each of the two display screens (the left battery on the lower screen, the right on the top).
In addition, it is possible to continuously supply the blade with power via the supplied network segment.
The construction of the shaft is very simple.
They have used a 16mm lens as an accessory, so that they can directly shoot at their subject.
The climb is made up of two switchbacks.
It was also found that the mechanical components were extremely accurate, and accordingly, the reliability and hard work were also applied.
In addition, a snow blanket is included in the delivery.
In terms of quantity, this is also a package.
So you can wear the leotard with all the supplies you might still want to buy without having any problems transport them or store them.
Shame, I've lost and it's small:(
Party we wanted to make: Frankfurt celebrates towering comeback against Leverkusen
What caused a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in the series without a win, Hesse was seemingly on the road to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then SGE surged in, within a good half an hour, the frustration over a stretched season start from the seating area and scored with 5-2. "It is wonder what the boys have been up to today," said trainer Oliver Glasner on DAZN and spoke of a "pastoral lob, on every single one of them who was with them".
There was initially no sign of a new batter for Frankfurt, who are now ranked ninth after their disappointing performance.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusen with 2:0.
What happened then, impressed the SGE coach as well.
As players came back and showed a fantastic performance, Glasner added.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who had been out for four games and his torn muscle had healed again, stressed the moral of his teammates.
I believe our mindset is unbelievably big," the 27-year-old said with a grin, admiring the result in particular for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to see today.
Glasner wants to keep the focus on the tasks to come, but now wants to put the emphasis on the staff situation in particular.
It is unusual that we are all fit in December, that all players are physically in a top league.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players also live high-profile lives.
Now they want to "go one step at a time and stay focused" and move tasks up one level per year.
As for next Wednesday, in the course of the English week, there will be an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 p.m., Sky) on the schedule.
I received a grade because the mail came back undelivered.
I have tried to reach them at #PRS_ORG# and provide them with an opportunity to listen.
Can it be sent directly to me again or will I have to wait until the money has been withdrawn and the order re-issued?
If that were the case for me, unfortunately I would not have even tried because it has already been very long.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# stage?
Defenders for women's handball at quarter finals against Spain
After defeating Denmark, Germany's women's handball players clenched their fists and smiled nervously from the stands.
At the end of the World Championships, the DHB selection saw off 800 spectators (8:13) in Granollers to claim a narrow victory and now faces off against host Spain in the quarter-finals.
We were much too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent, said the national coach Henk Groener.
We have to present ourselves differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the front group with 8.2 points as second behind the Dutch (10.0).
It's sad that we couldn't take the flow.
That was one of the worst games we have to lose," captain Emily Bölk said.
In the race to reach the semi-final of the World Championships in Athletics, which will take place on Tuesday, there will be a clear improvement in order to keep the dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Another German runner in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Alina Grijseels, with six goals.
We were simply not there - not in the attack, not in the defence, said back-up midfielder Xenia Smits and called for: "We have to look ahead now."
Up to the hint
The German team was not at the same level as in the previous five matches.
Fehlwürfe und technische Fehler in der Angriffe und Lücken in der Abwehr war für einen schnellen 0:4-Rückstand nach sieben Minuten verantwortlich
Only the wife of businessman Dinah Eckerle was so hot that she needed to be cooled down with some paraphernalia.
The first Tor went to the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-attack.
However, the initial explosion was not.
In the face of the aggressive deck of the dancers, the German women could hardly put up a fight - and even when they did, they mostly failed on the strong Althea Reinhardt in the centre of the Scandinavian dancers.
The game ended in a tie at 3-10 after 20 minutes, with Rückraumspielerine Mia Zschocke seeing off her teammate a little later for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-final, however, she can again participate.
Only in the closing stages of the first half did the DHB selection get a bit better into the game and at least five goals until the break.
After only seven minutes and 19 seconds, the hope of a comeback was gone.
The Greens again damaged all over the country, and made it clear that the defeated opponent, who in the run-up to the general election counted as a candidate for the presidency, so did.
As a result, the German team could no longer improve its performance and finished as the clear loser from the parquet.
DACH-Adventskalender Tag 6: Family traditions in the Christmas season
As part of the Reddit advent calendar, we have been getting ready for Nikolaustag and are taking this as an opportunity to deepen our commitment to family traditions, the Advent, Christmas Eve and the Christmas celebrations.
How was it like back then at home?
What about our partners?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the best thing for children?
The summit?
Plätzchenbacken?
Shrubs?
Is it compulsory?
Does the Christmas man come, the Christkind or is the gift just from Oma and Opa?
No matter how happy you are, everyone gives themselves a hand and around Christmas, it is as nice as having a family.
Is there now a fixed tradition, or even every year something else: he tells us how it happened in your family or how it happened!
Please send me some transaction number.. or otherwise, what could help you

The title implies that I am working as an importer in mobile trucks, where (as of yet) the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is impounded.
As soon as this is done, it goes to impound centers for me further.
I appreciate questions without any time limit to the organisational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, provided they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, which is stamped with the seal.")
In my area of responsibility, the declaration for the dismissal is made, the indication (Person has claimed for dismissal on the grounds of Corona dismissal and has no reason to do so), the medical documentation and so on.
The commission itself is delegated to qualified personnel, for example, medical assistants.
In my opinion, however, we often do not have any there, but only "only" (to please God, no missing value!) pharmazeutisch-technische Assistenten for the refining of oil, which can perform no refining (can you?), so that I also experience the most impactions myself there.
Serious "hoarder"-question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "hunter"?
With this dialect word, imported from Germany, it has been memorized in the BR television broadcast "We in Bayern".
But unlike many of the preceding days, the term "host my" was used this time by the audience unerringly.
No, it was not a "people who are nervous."
And no one, "it must go fast."
This, the people of the TV moderator thought, was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg shared the solution and probably also caused a lot of headaches for first offenders.
The fugitive is "a lone wolf," the audience is reminded, "with whom the feast is forbidden."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulting for years on the Bavarian television as an expert, confirmed this.
With the annotation, this is a typical oberpfalzish term, adapted from the more familiar word "houdern".
There was a gap in education - perhaps even among those who have lived in the apartment for a long time.
I can't buy any books for 2 weeks.
After confirming the following error message: Oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have the #PRS_ORG# installed, started, connected to the PC, and repaired.
Nothing has happened.
Reifenwahl beim Rennrad - really so pannensicher?
Today morning I was completely exhausted because I wanted to train for my road tour in the coming week.
Said, bought and I drove with my racing racer, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also quite good - but then it got boring, which is what happens in every town (this time in praise of Krefeld!)
Glassplates on the track.
Zack, laced up my shoes and my heels wanted to skip the rest of the stretch.
Since I did not have any real possibility of getting replacement clothing and gloves on wednesday, I had to turn back and take the last train home.
Then it was not as bad as it is now, maybe it's even better when I see it before the race tour.
But now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I had a relatively long trek over several days, I would be extremely hungry.
Now it's really not that bad, because the old runs by the owner (a very nice old man, I got off the bike at the time of the parade at 1pm and had to walk for 120km until the following day!) and the owners have also rated these as sub-optimal because they have been playing with them for years.
But if I think that I still have to make a change of direction at 80-90 km/h, then I'm really bad at it:)
Now I am talking to an older man at the train station, who was astonished that I did not have the Marathon Plus laces; these should be easy to put on.
It is certainly very disappointing now.
But are these really so unbreakable?
I have little appetite now that I am 40 euros/day off, just to make ends meet.
Still, I ask myself: I believe in the moment I am 25x622.
There are of course also (apparently) at the Marathon Plus Reifen, but the majority is already broad.
Is this a problem?
Or does she want to offer me a ride to another race?
The Walled-in section seems to be off! Do you prefer Durano DD?
Thank you again in advance for the help and love!

After the publication of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, there was only one question of time before our SOLO series would also receive offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new starter and reminds us of the great leads with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this building plan there is a passably designed step directly in front of it, aimed at raising the speaker's voice to the correct height.
This has no effect on the acoustic and can be adapted accordingly in the length.
The SOLO 15 is very well suited to people for whom the maximum strength is an even more important role, but a surprisingly high level should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not up to the task of generating nearly undisturbed sound.
However, that does not mean that the SOLO 15 is too loud.
In contrast, she seems to grow up slowly and to be extremely impressive and accurate for her age.
The SOLO 15 was tuned down with a slight boost.
This is generally common practice in broadcasters, where increasing the number of subscribers is crucial.
Exactly on the Hörplatz, the SOLO 15 is very clearly and clearly loud.
The highlands can be reduced to a small area and the soundscape can be distorted and made more dramatic.
Thanks to the pitch scale, the placement of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo grid is precisely measured and refined.
The reference-based extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100-6 OHM provide the same for a fear of dynamism.
The SOLO 15 not only adds to our SOLO series, but extends it with additional disposal options and quotas.
As it is required for all of our building works, at the beginning of the project, ideas about the final shape of the speaker's face are being made, in order to make corresponding changes to the construction with a plan.
If necessary, the furnishings can be provided, and the reduction of the speaker's volume accordingly adapted, as the furnishings then contain new material.
After all the records had been copied (e.g. at the record store), a 8 mm loch should be dug into the bottom of the record at the corresponding location, so that later the cable can be passed through easily.
With the help of an upper deck, the speaker's opening now follows the front, so that the B 100-6 OHM can be bundled later.
Rückseitig sollte diese Öffnung with a 45° Phase versehen werden um the opening area of the speaker chassis in the inner so large as possible.
The four detonation points of the B 100 - 6 OHM will receive a detonation in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail phase".
After that, you start to build the box and lay one of the two sides on a flat surface.
On these the spokes, the deck, the front and the bottom are now glued.
The three bridges should also be closed and repaired.
The impressions themselves can vary depending on the demand in terms of material strength, for example if you want to create finished panels from the wood market instead of creating them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be added.
Afterwards, all the records of the trek, including the two sides and the front, follow.
Using a passing shuttle or a forklift, the lifting of the bass reflex hood, as well as the attachment to the back of the vehicle, is facilitated.
Finally, a round of applause is used to greet all the audience members.
The surface of the floor can also be covered.
The floor is then covered with the floor of the garage and, in addition, with long wooden beams.
It follows the signal and the pre-echo (2.5 mm bore) of the transmitter chassis and the antenna.
After the house of Holzstaub has been consolidated (dismantled / dismantled), the removal of the roof begins.
This is achieved by the 35 mm Bass Reflex opening in the back.
This way, the entire and unobtrusive cable piece is threaded through the 8 mm bore in the floor, up to the terminal opening and then raised there by about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the room, the cable leads to the outdoor speaker and it is also possible to store it there.
Then the frequency wave is prepared and used.
The frequency plan and corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document: Montageanleitung Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency converter is installed and the termination terminal is drilled, the opening of the 8 mm cable is hidden in the inner box, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bASS REFLEX opening and with a little trick, you can let your heels slide and slide.
Through the opening of the B 100-6 OHM and with a small light, one can check the abdication accordingly.
According to the description, the attack is now underway.
Finally, the B 100 - 6 OHM is closed and the corresponding screws are removed.
The polarization plays an important role here, so that the termination (marked cable) at the plus pole (greater contact) must be terminated.
At the end, the bass reflex hole is fitted to the required length of 28 mm (the total length of the case) and sealed.
To combat the fire, a matte of the extinguishing material is drawn into two parts and spread in the room.
The opening of the bass reflex channel should be released.
Can I deposit a deposit now and start shipping in early June?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will also be hosting the OSCAST this year!
We are unfortunately not able to get more than four people into the studio at a time, which is a higher level of planning and explains the short term nature of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people on the scale, so that we can follow the Oscars 2021 with at least seven nods in the stream and hope for thousands of euros!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - we'll still give everything we have to make the Oscars as accessible as possible.
It will be about 0.30.
You already put drinks in, have a good breakfast and are ready for a long, but very interesting night.
