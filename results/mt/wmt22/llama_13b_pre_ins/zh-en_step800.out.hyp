At the annual meeting of Zhejiang University, students sang the main role, and the research results made people's minds open-Xinhua
Washing hands with air, judging diseases by smell, and accurately searching for the source of dust and haze. At the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year of Zhejiang University last night, a series of academic achievements with a large opening won recognition.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students. The research covers a wide range of fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science and humanities education. The students started from a wonderful point and created many high-end inventions with application value. Some of the projects have won awards at home and abroad.
Biological sensor: Your family doctor
Zhang Di Ming, a doctoral student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, and his team demonstrated a smart mobile phone sensor that is only half the size of a smartphone.
You only need to breathe gently, and this instrument can detect your health status from the gas components you breathe out. "
Zhang Di Ming introduced that the sensor is connected to the smart phone. After calling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the mobile phone.
Smart rings on the market can generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensors uses a new material called graphene. Its target is a chemical element. Its sharp "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the health status of the body.
Smart surgical lamp: Doctor's high-tech eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart surgical lamps have also been used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver medal at the 44th International Invention Exhibition in Geneva this year.
Zhu Linjing, a master's student at the School of Optoelectronics and Engineering, and Shen Junfei's team opened up a new idea in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented an intelligent LED surgical lamp.
“Many diseases are not diagnosed and treated in time. The lamp used in the operating room by doctors is related. "
Shen Junfei said that in the early diagnosis of cancer, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in time, the cancer cells will spread.
This smart surgical lamp has four lamps. By adjusting the light spectrum, it enhances the contrast of different tissues under light.
During the surgery, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless of the light according to the needs of the surgery and the personal habits of the patient.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College and the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash hands with air: save water and cool
Ordinary people usually wash their hands with water and soap, but Li Qizhang and other students invented a "hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the washing machine, our weight will be compressed by the air.
It's like a balloon.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the head of the water dragon and combines with water.
This way, we can wash our hands cleanly! "
Color reaction and bacterial residual experiment prove: The effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary washing hands.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force. It can not only ensure the cleaning degree, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention stood out from many world-class universities and won the only gold medal.

A very meaningful certificate - emergency certificate
This is one of the important skills certificates in addition to the driving license!
In general, emergency measures are actually emergency rescue at the time of sudden accidents, that is, rescue before the arrival of ambulances.
As we all know, in the process of rescue after the accident, there is actually a period of time, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time for emergency rescue.
If I really have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, and respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, people around know how important the rescue is!
When someone falls down around us, we can use professional knowledge to rescue him instead of standing there and doing nothing, which is so helpless that it scares people.
In China, we have 3 million accidental deaths every year, and the most dangerous is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the average is 15%.
At the casino hotel in Las Vegas, 78% can be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%."
This is what the founder of the first response said.
If a person has a heart attack, no breath, no heartbeat, you can't do anything to him.
It is necessary to do manual ventilation and chest compression to save the person.
I found that nowadays, not many people will have this kind of awareness to learn emergency rescue, but when the event occurs, it is too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.
It is uncertain whether it can save a person's life!
You can register for the emergency rescue course at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. Students can enjoy preferential treatment.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goal to be completed before the age of 25. It is also a few months before joining the goal list. But it is really completed!
Next, I will go to take other exams I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw a diving emergency certificate in the small red book. It seems that I have to take the emergency certificate in order to take the exam. Therefore, the emergency certificate is still very useful!

To sum up, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a full-scale trash.
But you have to say that this film is not a bright spot, and that is not a good thing at least.
There are a wide variety of offensive scenes, so that you can sleep soundly in the movie theater, so that you can be angry after watching it. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Qingyuan. It can set your anger on fire in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Dongzhen is really a gift from heaven.
The most painful thing about this piece is that it is a character in the Cixi novels, difficult to name, with many loopholes.
Even after watching it, you will doubt whether there is a director's hidden meaning, but when you carefully think about it, it turns out to be a pile of shit.
To put it simply, I have difficulty understanding some things.
The man's residence should be on a small island in the south, and his grandmother should live with him.
Her grandmother wanted to see the snow, so the plot arranged for her to go to the northeast to see the snow.
Are the elderly sitting on the bus from the south to the north to see the snow?
He and his father were very relaxed about it.
Then the old man didn't know what to say.
How did they get the business license to open a hotel on a deserted cruise ship?
Why can the Flying Party on the island easily close a mountain road?
Then the truck in the middle of the road stopped, and the truck driver could not be found around.
This is too obvious.
Why would a small party with no influence and suspected of breaking the law become a deputy?
In the face of high-interest loans, the police in the film also asked if there were any difficulties.
A grown-up knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to use a hotel card to open the door, and then forcibly arranges to find the hotel manager and sleeps outside the room?
This bizarre incident is full of the whole film, because the incident is too far-fetched to make me feel painful when I recall them.
In addition to the scene, the worst thing is the film's main theme, or rather, the film does not have a main theme at all, it is a face-saving monster.
At the beginning of the film, you think he is going to shoot a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you think it may be an inspirational film. After watching half of it, you feel that it may be a film that wants to show the difficult lives of young people in a small town. After watching the whole film, you don't know what you've watched. This leads to a deep suspicion of yourself. Why do you have to run to the cinema to enjoy the convenience.
For most people, in fact, they are very familiar with the route of all kinds of films. For example, if you want to shoot a car chase, you have to encourage yourself + comedy and tell the audience how to take a step towards success.
If you want to shoot a love film, then you tell the story of the young people in the small town and the service girls.
If you want to reflect reality, you can't have things in your story that contradict the real world.
（比如尹正演那个新摩托的角色被烧了，然后仍能唱歌），就不能去开一些连词尼迪看了都难以置信的脑洞。
As for the female lead, who is not very smart and can only act like a five-year-old child in some aspects, I really don't know whether it is because of acting skills or the director's requirements.
I also don't understand why Han Dong as a race car driver is so eager to add car crash scenes in his own movie.
Is it necessary to arrange such a film during the Spring Festival?

Inspection of the production and processing equipment of the drilling mud module Zhengzhou drilling mud module equipment introduction:
Zhengzhou Yingxin is a domestic manufacturer of concrete inspection shaft equipment, inspection shaft machinery, and tunnel wall segment machinery. From semi-automatic to fully automatic production lines.
Through many years of practice and development, it has now developed into a high-quality, mainly liquid pressure, mobile and fully automatic inspection well system and supporting equipment.
Inspection of the production and processing equipment of the drilling mud block module in Zhengzhou:
The characteristics and advantages of the production and processing equipment of Zhengzhou shaft wall brick module equipment:
Yi Jinnan's inspection of the construction machinery and equipment used in the construction of new types of construction materials such as coal, heat, water, electricity and gas is widely applicable.
For example, drainage and water storage facilities such as various types of inspection wells, rainwater mouths, ditches, cesspools and small constructions, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantages of using a concrete module to build an inspection well are that the four sides of the module are all concave and convex structures, and the combination of brick masonry forms a chain.
The wall body of the shaft is far superior to the brick form of the flat masonry.
The module is a hollow structure. After the combination of brick masonry, the longitudinal and transverse perforations are interconnected. After the perforation of the core, the mixed concrete network structure is formed, which plays a secondary reinforcement and waterproofing role.
The longitudinal and transverse beams of the module are equipped with reinforcement grooves, which increase the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, it is difficult for the inspection wells and drainage wells made of concrete to collapse, sink, and leak water. The mechanical properties of the wall modules of the wells are stable, simple to operate, and standardized in shape.
The intelligent control equipment data input and output device of the concrete inspection shaft drilling equipment module uses a touch screen liquid crystal display monitor to monitor the entire process of the operation of the robot, realizing ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of samples, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The hydraulic system of the wall formwork module adopts single-axle hydraulic pressure and transmission, double-axle hydraulic pressure and transmission.
The independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the impact of the host vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system operation.
The formwork of the concrete inspection well drilling equipment was lifted to the upper part of the mold, the storage tank door was closed, and the automatic conveyor belt was used. All were completed independently by the hydraulic system to reduce the wear and maintenance of the machine.
The equipment of the concrete inspection well module adopts imported computers and electrical appliances, sealed liquid pressure components, and integrated performance stability and reliability.
The excitation platform of the mold module of the well wall adopts a whole plate of steel, the surface line is cut and drilled, so that the filler box is free to move and fully reduces the mechanical damage.
By reducing the molding load, adding fillers and two-component encryption, and adopting an integrated, synchronous, Taiwan vibration and mold vibration, the effect of vibration is ensured.
The vibrating mechanism of the wall module is mechanized and automatically controlled by the computer according to the adjustment of the vibration amplitude according to the material price ratio, without damaging the brake, thus extending the service life and reducing the cost.
The mechanized control and manual control of the wall module are dual functions.

Chongqing Municipal Vocational School Pilots the Modern Apprenticeship System and Enrolls Employees of Enterprises - Xinhua
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, the city will pilot the "modern student system" talent training mode in 60 middle and primary schools, and the students participating in the pilot training will have student status at the same time, and will be enrolled as unit employees after being recorded by the pilot enterprise.
The municipal education committee requires that the recruitment of regular schools and the employment of enterprises be standardized, and the dual identity of students and employees of regular schools and enterprises be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, students, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement. For students under the age of 18 who have not yet reached the age of 18, they must sign a quadripartite agreement with students, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching contents and rights and interests protection of students in apprenticeship training.
Pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and cooperate with enterprises to carry out pre-employment and re-employment training.
The pilot schools should reform the talent training mode.
The school and enterprises jointly design a talent training plan, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, position standards, enterprise master standards, quality supervision standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot adopts the educational system as the pilot period. Students determine the internship time in enterprises according to the professional talent training plan. Generally, the top-level internship is 6 months.
In practice, enterprises should implement the enterprise brigade management model. According to the characteristics of different majors, one teacher can take 2 to 5 students to form a learning group to ensure that students are familiar with the skills required for each round of training.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, my city has divided into three batches to determine 60 city-level middle-level modern students, with about 50 people in each batch, for a total of about 3,000 students (students).
According to the principle of pilot first and then promotion, explore the long-term mechanism of establishing school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training and integration of human resources, effectively enhance the skills of students, and improve the employment rate and quality of students.

South African doctors: Omicron transmission is strong, but many are mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the new coronavirus Omicron is milder than that caused by the Delta variant, although the transmission speed is faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the spread of the new coronavirus in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng Province, South Africa, said in a doctor's organization report that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body pain and cough similar to the flu.
The organization's director, Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized.
Pelley said, "They were able to control the disease at home, and most people recovered within 10 to 14 days. "
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to suffer from severe illness due to coronavirus infection.
He said that compared with the previous outbreak of dermatitis, the new patients he treated in this outbreak "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctors' observation and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases: Among the new coronavirus patients hospitalized in the past few weeks, only 30% were seriously ill. This is half the proportion of severe cases in the first wave of the epidemic; the average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among the new coronavirus patients in the recent past, only 3% died, while the death rate in the early cases in South Africa was 20%.
Willem Hanekom, the head of the Africa Health Research Institute, quoted data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports: "At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a mild disease."
He also said: "It is still early now, and we need to obtain later data.
Usually, the time from hospitalization to death is later, while we have only entered this outbreak for two weeks. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta is still the world's major new coronavirus strain, the Omicron cases are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to the introduction of health officials, the number of new cases found in the first week of December in Gansu Province increased by 400%, and the test showed that more than 90% of the cases were caused by Omikron.
Thank you for your support today, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education comment: What does it take to rescue abducted children?
Compared with the famous public welfare advertising slogan "Without buying and selling, there is no killing", in a good environment without "catching up" demand, group defense and population-wide anti-trafficking, so that the trafficking behavior is unprofitable, risky and costly, such crimes will not be repeated.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has launched an emergency information platform for missing children.
This is an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and an Internet platform for the prompt search and rescue of abducted children.
Listening to the name of the App, "Circle of Friends", I felt warm.
The new technology is not only named "culture and art", but also information-based, practical and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement is to find and protect the children who have been abducted and ensure their personal safety and freedom.
Then comes the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment can be listed in many "big words" from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
But before the revelation of the selling case, the safety of the victims should be the top priority.
The situation is urgent, and under the goal of "rescue", we can put aside the controversial topics such as "whether child trafficking should be uniformly punished by death" for now and discuss them cautiously; but we cannot ignore the fact that children are being trafficked.
According to the experience of investigating such cases, human traffickers usually leave the crime scene as soon as they get what they want.
A moment's delay in taking action may cause the child to move further away from their parents, making it more difficult to solve the case.
In this case, it is a practical action to take out such direct clues as "Circle of Friends" to help solve the case and find the kidnapped child.
After all, "stealing" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
To combat crime, protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary and the strict enforcement of the law, there is no need to implement the care for the young and the weak.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can also be done better from the family to the society.
For example, a common case is that a family of three took a nap at the railway station and woke up to find that the child was missing.
We cannot expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, we should at least have a certain level of protection awareness.
Putting the child to sleep while taking turns to keep an eye on him, or leaving him under the care of someone trustworthy, are the most effective ways to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on trafficking crimes, the purchase of abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single act of misconduct is often just a link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for trafficking in children is 5 years; in cases of special gravity, it may be punished by death with confiscation of property.
With the high starting point and the highest maximum penalty, the crime of trafficking in children is clearly a crime of punishment.
There are still many cases of abduction every year.
It can be seen that some people's legal awareness is weak in the aspect of raising children.
The legal education of these people should be synchronized.
In order to effectively control the crime of trafficking in persons, it is not enough to rely on the strict enforcement of the law by the authorities.
If the "market" is widespread, the sellers are greedy, constantly innovate the means of selling, and form a "fighting" situation with law enforcement, the action of theft will inevitably fall into the trap of low efficiency.
Therefore, eliminating the backward concept, generalizing legal common sense, and also helping to root out the crime of buying and selling children.
Yang Gao Dong delivered a report on the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress and the Provincial Party Congress at Mount Ma'anshan
Drawing strength from the party's century-long struggle
Hunan Daily, December 10 (full media reporter Gong Baiwei) According to the unified arrangement of the provincial party committee, on the morning of December 10, Yang Gaodong, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of Propaganda of the Provincial Party Committee, made an interactive exposition in the video park of Ma'anshan. He thoroughly studied and implemented the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, studied and implemented the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions and important instructions for the important speech of Hunan, and studied and implemented the spirit of the 12th provincial party congress.
From the three aspects of ideal belief and original mission, self-revolution and youth party, and the party's leaders and party's theory, Yang Gaodong, combined with his own self-awareness and personal experience, explained the core spirit and practical requirements of the meeting in depth and systematically.
He pointed out that it is necessary to integrate the spirit of the meeting and the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping to the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee and the spirit of learning, to integrate learning, to enhance the ideological consciousness, political consciousness and action consciousness of guarding the "two establishments" and achieving "two maintenances", and unswervingly move forward in the direction indicated by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
At the interactive exchange session, representatives of grassroots cadres, entrepreneurs and young people asked questions about the relationship between the three historical decisions, how to understand the decisive meaning of "two establishments", how cultural enterprises can grasp the orientation, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the history of the Party for a hundred years. Yang Gaodong answered the questions in plain language and vivid examples. He sent a message to young Party members, saying that they should draw strength from the history of the Party's hundred-year struggle, closely unite around the Party Central Committee, unswervingly follow the Party, and dedicate themselves to writing responsibilities and duties in their youth.

The International Olive Oil Council divides olive oil into two major categories, five grades.
The initial pressing of olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is obtained by mechanically cold pressing the fresh olive fruit and removing impurities after filtering.
According to the different acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: is the highest grade and quality of olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is perfect, with a delicate and elegant plant flavor, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
High-quality virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): Acidity is slightly higher, but does not exceed 2%, the taste is pure and fragrant.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: Taste and aroma are still good, acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil refined from olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or "second oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Pure olive oil: It is a mixture of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of virgin olive oil, which is used to adjust the flavor, aroma and color. Its acidity is less than 1.5%, and it appears as a translucent yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: It is obtained by extracting and refining olive oil from olive residue.
If you have seen the classification of grades, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
It is worth noting that, like grapes used to make wine, olives come from different regions and different varieties of olives will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow olive trees:
The coastal areas of the Middle Sea have the most suitable soil and climate conditions for the growth of olive trees, such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and rainfall.
In addition to the coastal areas of the Bohai Sea, other areas can only plant zero stars in suitable areas.
Main production areas (mainland China):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Albania, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon and other countries with similar climates are also far away in the southern hemisphere, such as Argentina, Peru and South Africa.
Olive harvesting month:
From May to June every year, the olive tree blooms and bears fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, changing from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the real harvest season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the oils discovered so far.
As the G20 Summit came to a close, the world pledged to keep the flame of freedom alive
The online "Summit for Democracy" (Summit for Democracy) concluded on Friday (December 10), which was attended by leaders from 110 countries and governments, as well as representatives from civil society and the private sector.
In the closing remarks, Boediono said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world, and the autocratic regime can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Tang Feng, a representative of the Taiwan government and a member of the Executive Yuan, and Ronny Tong, a Hong Kong democracy activist who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Bayden said, "We know how difficult the work we are facing is.
But we also know that we can embrace the challenge, because I have said before that the world of democracy is everywhere.
The special regime can never extinguish the flame of freedom. It burns in the hearts of people all over the world. "
Bayden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
He said: "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the pillars of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and overcome the moderating and shocking forces of monopoly, as well as those who want to pursue power in the name of public interest."
The theme of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" is to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and resist authoritarianism, and counter digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values.
This day coincides with the "International Human Rights Day".
In his opening speech on the same day, UN Secretary-General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially the challenges brought about by new digital technologies.
He said, "It is time to reiterate the common values and positions and the democratic determination.
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving inequalities, fighting corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires the firm condemnation of all forms of nationalism, localism and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Ronny Tong, a democratic activist in Hong Kong, delivered a speech at the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding the attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of Chinese minorities such as Hong Kong and Tibetan people.
He said, "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must cooperate.
It is our primary task to use all that we have (resources) to ensure the revival of democracy. "
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite to resist the threat of the Communist Party.
He said, "Perhaps some of you are afraid of angering General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you do not want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps some of you do not recognize the threat of (the Communist Party) to our democratic values.
And this is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason we must change. "
Tang Feng, a member of the Executive Yuan of the Taiwanese government, attended the round-table discussion on "Fighting against digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values" and released the "National Declaration" through video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of fighting against authoritarianism and tyranny.
He also shared the experience of how to fight the new coronavirus through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "On the occasion of Taiwan's democratic revival, we have always firmly stood at the forefront of the world to oppose authoritarianism, and even more, we have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the outbreak of the epidemic, the authorities in various places took the name of public health and collective interests to justify the violation of human rights, and the signs of the decline of global democracy were evident.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to seal the city to control the epidemic, and we do not have to take down the flag to defeat false information. "
On the second day of the "Democratic Summit," the US Treasury Department announced that it had imposed sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea and other countries that had been confirmed to have seriously violated human rights. At the same time, it imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was confirmed to have used surveillance technology to help violate human rights.

I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't stick to it, so I want to find a slightly cheaper price to practice.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often inversely proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap "entrance shot", which is actually industrial garbage.
Their strength is very low, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball cannot be stopped, and the high hand is very difficult to drive.
Their logic and slogans exist - tennis is so hard, you know you can't learn, and you know you can't afford to buy, so we do a cheap thing to fool you, you play twice, and you won't play again, so this racket is inexpensive, and you won't mind.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it shows that you have progressed, and when the time comes, I will come here to buy the valuable, and I will earn twice.
It is recommended to buy a second-hand good golf club at a similar price. Choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not well-known enough. Therefore, a good golf club is not worth the price. A new golf club at 500 yuan or 600 yuan is quite good. A second-hand golf club at 200 yuan, is it not worth it?
It is friendly to newcomers, but once the newcomer stage passes, it becomes arrogant. Most people, especially women, do not pass the newcomer stage.

In fact, there is a lot to say about the dressing of girls with a slender body.
Girls with plump bodies should not wear dresses that are too short or too long. The length should just reach the ankles. Otherwise, it would reveal their plump thighs.
If the skirt is too short, the fat legs will be exposed.
Too long will make people feel short and fat.
If you wear the middle and lower three sections, it seems that you have naturally grown taller. It is the use of different colors for the upper body, skirt and long trousers. When you look at it, you will have a sense of lengthening.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the perfect match for plump girls (a point that the author deeply understands), dark colors also hide your fat body well, and the black short skirt with a high waist is also the favorite of plump girls.
Wearing dark clothes, especially black trousers, will make you look thinner.
If your legs are fat, your socks and shoes should not be too noticeable.
The more democratic, the less colorful.
To prevent people from paying attention to your legs and feet, so that people can feel fat.
For a slightly plump girl, it is necessary to say something about the wisdom of dressing and matching.
Thin girls should not wear tight shorts, and the upper garment should not be too short or stuffed in the skirt, which will make people uncomfortable. If your legs are thick, you can wear black trousers or grid trousers (the kind of grid), choose a soft and delicate printed chiffon dress, and wear a bold upper garment to hide the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, the micro-thin girl is also worth mentioning when wearing a short skirt.
Fat girls wearing short skirts should choose tops that match the color of short skirts. This will greatly enhance the effect of your fat body.
Wearing a short skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the most IN combination in summer!
If you are a fat man with thin legs, you are recommended to choose a fluffy skirt.
Not only can it hide your belly, but also show your advantage.
The A-line dress will be very thin, suitable for fat girls, and the upper garment should choose a little tight to form a layered feeling.
Wearing a simple white T-shirt with a short skirt, even a fat man can try.
Thin girls can also wear fashionable clothes.
As long as you can master the rules of wearing clothes, even the chubby girls will be the focus of attention.
After the change in clothing, we should also do more sports in life and strive to get rid of the label of overweight girls as soon as possible 😄

Xinhua News Agency + Xinhua News Agency + Beijing Youth Ice Hockey League - Xinhua News Agency

Girl shoots an arrow for her sister: "It's OK to be injured" - Xinhua
In Hangzhou Wulin Square, a girl stood in front of a large wooden board, which was written with the words "Human Flesh Pillar, 10 yuan per arrow".
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl Gao Tian's donation to her sister's wedding" went viral on WeChat.
The photo shows that a girl stands in front of a big wooden board slightly higher than a person at Hangzhou Wulin Square. The board is written with the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan one arrow", which means that after paying the road, the archery can be used.
This behavior has attracted the attention of netizens.
Last night, the person in charge of the publicity department of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the reporter of the Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl was her sister's niece, but such behavior was not worth advocating. After the warning, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl on the street "arrow target" donation
In the photo circulated on the Internet, a girl with long hair stands in front of a large wooden board, on which is written in black ink the words "human flesh pedestal, 10 yuan one arrow", while another wooden board in front of her displays her bank account number and WeChat and Alipay accounts.
The picture caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believed that this action was "begging for favors", and many netizens agreed with it.
We found the situation around 10 a.m. on the 23rd when we patrolled the square. At that time, the crowd had already decreased.
In an interview with local media near the scene of the incident, the police at the Tianhe police station said that the two girls on the stage were about 20 years old and dressed in a youthful and beautiful manner.
Among them, the girl who played the "meat hook" was still crying and asking the passerby to play the game. Another girl stood by her side and helped her to drink, saying that her friend's sister had gotten blood disease and now urgently needed surgery, please help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's treatment of blood disease.
Last night, the person in charge of the publicity department of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Jia Lili and she was donated by her sister Jia Yanyan.
However, since the treatment still requires more than 300,000 yuan in fees, he did not know what to do and made such a move.
He said that during the whole process, the two girls were on the spot, one was responsible for shooting, but did not participate in it. During the whole process, no one was found to shoot arrows. It was only found that someone watched and took pictures, which were sent to the microblogging.
After the police dealt with the security department, it was found that the arrows used were not controlled.
The person in charge said, "It is not advocated to adopt this method of soliciting donations."
After being warned by the police at the police station, she has left the police station.

What is the hottest thing in 2021?
Undoubtedly, the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win the award?
Previously, there was an article entitled "Quick Look! The Project Manager Can Impact the Gold Medal Olympic Project" which was very popular. It mentioned that in many projects, the project managers were definitely in the first place. No one can compete with them: moving stones, traveling, and staying up all night are the project managers' daily lives. Putting out fires, carrying pots, and apologizing are not even worth mentioning.
This article, which seems to be a joke, also reflects the daily hardships of project managers, representing the lack of enthusiasm for the current project management work.
And those who are engaged in project management work are gradually choosing to get rid of the dilemma of work through some actions.
According to the number of PMP (Project Management Professional) applicants every year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the "China Project Management Development Report (1999-2019)": By September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants in China was nearly 600,000, and the number of people who passed the PMP® certification examination was about 420,000, and the number of people with valid certificates was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificates in the world.
The number of PMP certification holders has increased year by year in the past 10 years. This shows that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer possible to rely on the "old experience" to do things in the past. The ever-changing work environment makes us know that we have to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the road ahead.
However, can the PMP ensure the smooth progress of project management work?
Many project management beginners said that through the study of PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically grasp the ten major areas and five major processes of project management, but when they really do project management work, they are still in a fog.
Many project managers often ask the following questions: The project management knowledge is not in place, relying on personal experience, empty of project management theory, do not know how to practice; Lack of systematic project management process support in the system, it is impossible to land in the work, the project estimate is not right, the degree of control is different, the project is dragged and dragged again and again; Member distribution is not clear, the "old oil" in the team does not know how to deal with, cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, focusing on the fields of product innovation and R&D management, it has helped to train a large number of product managers, project managers and other R&D key talents for many excellent enterprises. It has also won the honorary titles of "China's enterprise R&D management talent training demonstration base" and "China's R&D management talent training demonstration base" with the online course of "R&D project management special training".
Online Course "Project Management Specialized Training" This is a way of online fragmented learning, combining the practical cases, tools and methods of many R & D enterprises, helping you master the essential knowledge and standards of action of project managers and take the next step in your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less investment to promote the training of project managers and bring high-efficiency operation results to enterprises.
Without relying on hearsay, let's take a look at how other students rated this course: This course is given by a team of experts from Zhongteng Huxia (the former Huawei R&D management team), who will deliver a professional lecture on the course content based on international advanced project management methods and real business scenarios from well-known enterprises.
Moreover, it will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich templates and forms to help students turn the learned contents into specific work after the class.

Jia Xin "Double Twelve" advocates rational consumption to consumers - Economic Observer - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double 11" National Network Payment Transaction Amount reached 177 billion yuan, a new high compared with previous years.
The abundant flower-shaped red packets and the live broadcast of the delivery of goods once again made the consumers shout for benefits. On the one hand, this consumption boom made people feel that the national consumption power was becoming stronger and stronger. On the other hand, however, it was necessary to calmly think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of "Double 12", Jia Xin Consumption Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jia Xin") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the broad masses of users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption consciousness and consumption habits, and to refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Nutrition Survey Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial nutrition index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
On the whole, China's residents have performed well in financial consumption, but there are large differences in financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and the young is relatively low. "One old and one young" will still be the focus of financial education. The "Report on the Debt Situation of Chinese Young People" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Young People Consumption Report" released by CCTV-2 show that the young generation has a huge consumption potential. Credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products. Nearly half of them do not have accumulated debt. Although the young generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, there is a big gap between the "excessive spending" label attached by the outside world. Some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behavior, resulting in too much financial pressure and debt risk, and even gradually increasing social problems. Financial institutions should take on social responsibilities and provide positive guidance.

Vietnamese People's Newspaper - ASEAN Response to Common Challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stopover includes Amman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit to Kazakhstan by King Mohammed VI of Morocco since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a ban on Qatar in the middle of 2017, which led to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Kazakhstan and imposed a comprehensive ban on it, accusing Kazakhstan of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
The tense situation in diplomacy has seriously affected the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and has had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have locked down the land and sea routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the January 2021 summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, when all Gulf countries signed an agreement with the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are the first to try to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to Qatar.
The national reconciliation of Gulf Arab countries is aimed at responding to the common challenges and is based on the interests of all countries and regional stability.
During the visit of the Saudi King to Amman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two countries in the Gulf.
The connection of the 725-kilometer-long channel between the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel and integration of the supply chain of citizens of the two countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $50 billion in Amman, and the two countries' enterprises have signed 13 cooperation memoranda worth $30 billion.
Saudi King Salman's visit to the countries in the Gulf coincides with the Iranian nuclear agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was reached between Iran and the major powers in the world to save Iran's nuclear agreement - an agreement between the Gulf Arab countries and Iran, which was blamed for being unable to solve the Iranian missile problem.
All countries in the Gulf have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
All countries in the Gulf believe that it is a shortcoming to fail to solve the Iranian missile problem and take no action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop that the nuclear talks between major powers and Iran failed to meet the expectations of all countries in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct talks.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that have slowed down the national economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The summit meeting to be held soon will be the first summit meeting of the member countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization since the end of the dispute between some member countries and Kazakhstan.
This is an opportunity for the Foreign Ministers' Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Regional Cooperation Forum to reassess the diplomatic achievements made to promote the unity of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and to propose measures for its member countries to fully cooperate with each other to respond to common challenges and make contributions to the stability and development of the countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

Good
It is said that the sound of the new mountain district is the largest!
This car we brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor of Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the Malaysian ringgit is close to 2 million yuan, the annual road tax is less than 10,000 yuan, four-wheel drive, why call it LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
I didn't know that even the small editors didn't know. According to the data, it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. That is, when the small editors' myvi reaches 30km/h, people will reach 100km/h.
The low-slung body, the scissor doors, the huge air intakes around the body and the 6.5 V12 engine under the glass were a perfect interpretation of Lamborghini's style.
There is no need to say too much about the car model. Just Google it and the small editor has summarized some information that Google may not give you!
It's too eye-catching. Wherever you go, everyone is looking at you. (It's actually quite cool.)
1km oil change is about RM1 (car owner does not care)
The posture of getting on and off the bus needs to be practiced, or else it will be a bit embarrassing (because you will not be able to get off the bus and sit halfway).
The sound of the engine was too loud, and my ears were ringing when I got off the bus (but it was still cool).
The size of the car is too large, and it is too crowded to stop at ordinary parking places. It is afraid to be knocked down by the opening door of the adjacent car!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (small editor's own words, unrelated to the car owner, haha)
Don't be fooled, this video is not for sale, sorry!

Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of academic ideas and value pursuits formed over a long period of time in the development process of a university. It is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of universities has played an important role in the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and society, and even in the progress of a nation.
Since its birth as the first modern university in the world, the university has shouldered the unique mission different from that of other social organizations. For the Chinese university, it has arisen in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit is profoundly influenced by the traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "bright virtue and peaceful world" and the patriotic responsibility of "promoting learning and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of information technology and internationalization in higher education is becoming more and more obvious. The global competition for education, science and technology, and talent is intensifying, and the structural reform of higher education as an important "supply side" is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and World-Class Disciplines" has put forward higher and more updated requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to enter the ranks of the world's top universities and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap in a relatively short period of time, and realize "bending over the car"?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to their three advantages: the first is the advantage of follow-up, through the continuous introduction of outstanding overseas academic talents to learn from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and quality of study; the second is the advantage of culture, to inherit the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, to promote the development of excellent traditional culture, to gather forces, shape brands and improve images; the third is the advantage of system, to give play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthen goal-driven, unite consensus, optimize resource allocation and provide sustainable and firm guarantee for the acceleration of colleges and universities to the world's most advanced level.
In particular, it should be noted that building a world-class university cannot be done in one fell swoop. All schools must play to their strengths while highlighting their individuality and characteristics.
The characteristics of running a school should not only reflect the common characteristics of Chinese schools, but also reflect the unique goals and characteristics of the school.
As for Zhejiang University, we pay attention to three aspects in running schools: First, we focus on the cultivation of outstanding innovative entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated humanistic environment of colleges and enterprises, and form a whole-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; Second, we focus on the meeting of disciplines, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, and create an institutional environment for the meeting of disciplines; Third, we focus on the system of running schools and social service, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and speed up the formation of a Zhejiang University-wide research and education cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to adhere to the spirit of the university and make the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the "seeking innovation" school training, the "diligence, virtue, enlightenment, perseverance" common values, and the "Hangzhou River, Qi Zhenhua, open up the country" common components have become the latest expression of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is the school's unswerving adherence to the correct direction of study, the continuous accumulation of cultural height and spiritual power, and the rich connotation and profound meaning.
Among them, "Hainan River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the belief that "the world's talents are used by me", and represents the high-quality idea of drawing on the quality of the world's famous schools to educate people; "Qiuzhen Hengde" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, which means that universities should not only pursue truth, but also bear the impact of virtue and character; "Kuimei Fengman" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of new knowledge, the innovation of scientific research, as well as the reform and development, and the rejuvenation of the old and new.
This series of spiritual ideas and values is the soul of Zhejiang University, which has been in operation for 120 years.
“The wise hear no sound, the sage sees no shape.”
When China's colleges and universities further step into the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, they should have a profound understanding of the times and missions of higher education, and speed up the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, we must uphold humanistic care and independence, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the national spirit inspire and stimulate each other, and provide unstoppable momentum for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation and the realization of the common ideals of humanity.

When NFT was launched, the crypto community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia. Some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic began to obtain stable income from the game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based pet-rearing game that uses a variety of NFTs, including CryptoKitties, and is currently the NFT project with the highest trading volume, having exceeded US$3 billion.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily income exceeded 8.2 million US dollars, just behind "Wangzhe Rongyao".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity claimed that its daily active users have exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" will bring a new "palytoearn" model to more people, through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role, in addition to obtaining fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the management of the game ecosystem.
This property is not granted by the game creator, but is guaranteed by the blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is that the enterprise has chosen the road of competition. That is to say, it has chosen an industry with a large growth space and at least a market scale of more than 100 billion. Next, it has chosen an industry with good growth prospects in the future. Finally, it has chosen an industry supported by policies.
The broader the market scale, the longer the industry development stage, the broader the industry competition pattern.
Go for it!
In the new year, the first thing to do is to sum up the 2021 adjustment of the 2022 military deployment.
The art lies in "doing things right", that is, doing things correctly.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find the direction, and the art is to land. There is a space for strategic thinking in most martial arts thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (strategic thinking) can be thought of as whether to continue to deepen in the current field or to expand horizontally in other fields (strategic thinking); for example, how to increase the retention rate of customers (artistic thinking) can be thought of as how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); and on the basis of increasing the participation rate of activities (artistic thinking), it can be considered how to set the correct KPI of activities and achieve the correct activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and precisely attracting new customers. On the basis of increasing DAU (artistic thinking), it can be considered whether the current growth is sustainable.

American ethnic groups complained that three well-known schools in Canada, including York University, discriminated against Chinese students - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian American groups in the United States submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting the discrimination against Asian American applicants in the admission process of three universities - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the press conference, Zhao Yuzhong, the chairman of the group, said that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian American applicants who meet the conditions of American colleges and universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asian Americans at these three American colleges and universities has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities "long-term and systematically discriminate against Asian American applicants" in the process of so-called "comprehensive consideration."
Zhao Yu said that according to the study of scholars such as Sander in 2014, among the three universities, the relative number of Asian applicants is the lowest in all ethnic groups.
According to the data of the US Department of Education, among all the schools in the Common Spring Bamboo League, the admission rate of black students at Brown University and Dartmouth College is the lowest, and Yale University and Brown University have effectively implemented a racial quota of more than 20 years for Asian applicants.
Zhao Yu told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice would be able to conduct an investigation and take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in recruitment.
They also hope that colleges and universities can take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities that have been sued have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it had complained of Harvard University's admission discrimination, but the US Department of Education did not accept it on the basis of procedure.
In addition to the American Chinese community, the complaint was also filed by American Indian, Korean American, Japanese American and Pakistani American education groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building in Yuyang Town, Zhejiang Province, from the real estate agent. After visiting the site many times, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory building.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu purchased the details of the purchase of the factory building after consulting with Mr. Lin, the owner of the real estate, and transferred 200,000 yuan by bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payer on the "Factory Purchase and Sale Agreement" and stipulated that "if the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. The two parties agreed to sign a factory purchase and sale contract within one week."
However, after that, the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of sale of the plant and the payment method, leading to the delay in the signing of the real estate purchase and sale contract.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
It's not easy to see the house, the deposit has been paid, and the mortgage is also ready. He signed the contract and asked the seller to sell it. However, the seller did not sell it, making Lu Shixiong helpless and angry again.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the People's Court of Yuyao City.
After trial, the court held that the two parties failed to sign a formal contract in the end. It cannot be solely blamed on the defendant. It is reasonable to estimate that the negotiation failed, so the case should not apply the fixed penalty rule. The defendant does not have to bear the double penalty for the breach of contract.
After the first trial, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the original verdict.
Lawyers remind that it is necessary to be cautious during the trading process.
At the time of signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to pay attention to the due diligence, such as verifying the information of the property owner and whether the property is occupied by others, and clearly stating the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties at the time of performance of the contract.
（德国之声中文网） 周五结束的“民主峰会”，中国外交部发言人周六(12月11日)发表谈话表示，美国在“领导人民主峰会”举办，是“以意识形态划分，把民主工具化和武器化，假民主的名义行反民主的实际，煽动分歧对抗、转移国内矛盾”。
The Chinese government believes that "in the long run, the United States will strengthen its political system and value concept to the people, promote the 'democratic transformation', impose unilateral sanctions, and plan the 'color revolution', causing disastrous consequences.
The word "democracy" has already become a "large-scale lethal weapon" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
This summit is a fulfillment of his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held via video conferencing and invited leaders from 111 countries around the world, including leaders from Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
Internationally and in the United States, there have also been voices of doubt, such as criticism of the invitation list, which includes some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, who questioned whether the summit was truly intended to promote democracy or was organized for geopolitical purposes.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also attended the video democracy summit
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday that "Today's American-style democratic disease is becoming more and more serious. Money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, income inequality and other issues are becoming more and more serious." The United States' democracy is a "rich man's game" based on capital.
In his speech, U.S. President Barack Obama said, "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the pillars of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and overcome the moderating and shocking forces of monopoly, as well as those who want to ruthlessly pursue power before the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not something that can be taken for granted. "We must constantly update it among every generation. In my view, this is a decisive challenge for us in this era. "
Bayan also said that "in the face of the continuing and worrying challenges, democracy needs defenders to defend it."
The United States pledged to launch a one-year campaign after the summit, including a $424 million proposal to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that all countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the real democracy summit scheduled to be held in 2022.
Guterres said, "Let all countries implement our commitments and report our progress next year."

Taste good, meat is good, service is warm
It's been a long time since I've come to Jiachang. The fruit is so delicious and the ingredients are so real. The first time I tasted the southern flavor of my favorite steamed buns, I fell in love with it!
The degree of cooking of the steamed rice was just right, and the amount was very sufficient. The steamed chicken was as delicious as ever, and the soup was also not bad...
Flavor praise Service enthusiasm Meat good
The old shop in Jichang has been there for many years. It is a small wooden house.
You have to wait for a long time to eat the steamed rice, and the pot of steamed rice is broken...
It's been a few years since I've eaten at Jiachang, and the rise of various small shops has dispersed the flow of customers.
It's hard to find a seat when you come to the store. The quality of the food is not good to say, as usual.
Taste praise Meat good Main dish praise

What is the red card rule?
Everyone's hobbies are different. Some people like to collect, some people like to eat, and of course there are people who like to drink alcohol. Red Label Whiskey is one of the most popular Scottish whiskeys in various countries at present. In addition, Red Label Whiskey has won the International Spirits Challenge Gold Award.
Every bottle of red wine has its own unique flavor, but if you don't know how to taste it, you'll spoil its aroma.
What about the red card?
Here is a simple introduction.
Red card warning:
The Glenlivet Winchester Reserve is a blend of about 35 Scottish whiskies. It has a rich aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scottish whiskey. The rich aroma contains sweet and smoky flavors.
The aroma of alcohol is fresh, with a slight aroma of grass and strong smoke flavor.
The wine can be directly mixed with ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red Star Macallan entered the domestic market, and in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, Red Star Macallan + Coca-Cola or Snowflake or New Classic became a timeless fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to being able to harmonize with sour flavors, can bring people pleasure visually, and join the drinks to change the taste of alcohol.
Red wine with a slice of lemon and sugar (white sugar can also be used) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The original flavor of red wine has some acidity. Adding sugar can balance the acidity. The lemon will bring a refreshing aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweet and sour degree can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
The above three are the best drinking methods of red wine. Everyone can try it as a reference. I hope that the introduction of the small editor can help everyone.
Education thought: How college entrance examination makes "study" and "study" get what they deserve - Xinhua
Three students from Lanzhou University wrote a letter to the school leaders, reflecting the dilemma of the college entrance examination, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the examination, change the form of the examination, and make the examination truly reflect the level of students.
Indeed, for a long time, college entrance examination has been a "hot topic".
In the university campus, the students come from five lakes and four seas. Their abilities are different, and the learning progress is different. The learning situation is very different.
It is inevitable to have different perceptions on the assessment of such a diversified group.
Of course, if the examination questions are all the same, the repetition rate is high, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably give rise to a completely different feeling.
Students who do not work hard may be able to pass the examination by focusing on the attack before the examination. If they want to do other things, they may achieve twice the effect.
In this way, even if you don't put in any effort in learning, you can still pass the exams and even get a good grade. And if you are a "study snob", you will never be absent from class and always do your homework well. You will seldom see "strange phenomena" on the exams.
It seems that the students of Lanzhou University reflected the problems that existed in the college entrance examination. It is believed that such a situation is not unique to Lanzhou University.
From this level of meaning, we should praise the three students who wrote the letter directly.
In fact, everyone who has been to college knows that it is common to see people preparing for the college entrance examination, trying all kinds of ways to "grasp" the examination questions from teachers, striving to expand the scope of the examination, and seeking "intensive guidance" before the examination. Even in the examination, it is not surprising to see people taking notes, asking teachers for help after the examination.
In the view of the author, as a quality assessment direction, it is more important for a teacher to have a comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as a scientific topic based on this foundation.
Entering the undergraduate stage, the majors begin to subdivide, and many majors focus on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether one has a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge of a subject is what the college entrance examination tests.
And the basic knowledge of undergraduate students is basically subject-based basic theories and common sense. From the point of view of knowledge, the space for change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics learned 20 years ago is still important to learn now."
But the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the examination questions are single and repeated.
In many colleges and universities, exams are generally made up of topic groups, which are then compiled into a test paper by subject senior teachers. The examination paper is also reviewed by all teachers in the subject, which can to some extent overcome the problem of repeated questions.
However, in order to design a set of tests that meet the actual situation of teaching and learning, the topic should be distributed in a balanced manner according to the overall situation of the student's learning. It is necessary to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation and analyze the degree of student learning, so as to make the examination topic have a dynamic grasp of the difficult and the type, which can highlight the basic knowledge examination and take into account the ability examination at the same time, and at the same time, innovatively design the type.
The examination is the baton of university education. What kind of examination, the student will have a corresponding preparation plan. In the past, it has affected the effectiveness of university education.
For the student's advice, Lanzhou University attaches great importance to it and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
It is required that all teaching units organize teachers to carry out seminars and course final examinations, prepare examination questions and relevant systems, strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination questions and the examination and approval process, refine the evaluation and grading, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
From the perspective of the mechanism, it is a problem that the college entrance examination needs to face, such as solving the problem of single question type and repeated questions. Of course, it needs to introduce the corresponding system, but the hard work lies in the daily, the teacher needs to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to absorb the teaching content, but also to absorb the learning situation of the students, two heads to absorb, teaching and learning will be better docked, form a virtuous interaction, the examination will also be more in line with reality, so that "studying" and "studying" can get what they deserve.

Because we didn't arrange the time well, we changed the time twice. Ms. Lanlan was very patient and helped us arrange the time.
Later, they chose a good weekend to shoot.
Jin's staff, whether consultants, make-up artists or photographers, were all praised.
That was the first time I had my make-up done professionally. I couldn't believe how good I looked.
Xiao Jing and another sister (I'm sorry, I forgot her name) were very patient and natural in makeup.
The scene was filmed in the city of Jiangsu. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and I didn't feel very cold. When we took photos, the make-up artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes and accessories, and would immediately help us fix anything that was slightly off.
The photographer was also very humorous, and I felt very happy to take photos the next day.
When choosing photos, because I saw a lot of cases on the Internet, I didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we chose the photos, we really didn't have the idea of adding photos. We put 24 photos directly into the dinner. One photo didn't add. (I heard that the bride's sister, who took the wedding photo, added more than 10,000 photos to the more than 7,000-dollar package. At that time, I was shocked and afraid that I would choose too many.)
Today, the photos were finished and sent to me. I looked at them and thought they were not very good. They immediately helped me redo them.
Compared with the photos taken by my sister before, I feel that our photos are really satisfactory. Simple and clean, just the style I want.
I sincerely recommend that everyone go and take a wedding photo with Empress Dowager Cixi!
Set price: 3999 yuan
Ms. Jin thanked you for your sincere wishes for your happiness and prosperity, and wished you a bright future!

3,200 newborn babies in Saudi Arabia did not receive birth certificates due to special anti-forgery paper
Saba National Registration Bureau said that due to the use of special anti-counterfeit paper for storage, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October, affecting a total of 3,200 people.
However, the director of the episode, Krystal Amorsino, assured that all babies who have applied for the birth certificate have been recorded in the system, and the certificate will be mailed next week.
At a press conference, he responded to a report by a news website that claimed that there were up to 10 months of delays in the printing of the newspaper.
He said that the problem had emerged two months ago, and Salvai also faced the same problem.
One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeit paper have been affected by the epidemic, leading to a delay in delivery to China.
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used by the Shaba Daily is different from that used in other regions, so it cannot be traded with the inventory of other states.
Keith Amunoz revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper was shipped to Kuala Lumpur on the 6th this month, and was delivered to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
The episode will be shipped to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday for the final stage of printing and is expected to be delivered to the applicant in about two working days (December 20).
“We will notify the applicants to go to the local bureaus to receive the birth certificate.”
He added that Saudi Arabia has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates this year.
From more than 7 o'clock to now
Is it coming soon?
I mean food

The State Council issued a document requesting to strengthen the port city's epidemic prevention and control by setting up a "buffer zone" and conducting 48-hour acid test anonymously-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic at the port cities, requiring that personnel leaving the port cities near the land border (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) must have a 48-hour HIV test within 48 hours, and personnel arriving at the port cities near the land border must have at least one HIV test.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date of determining the port city range and announcement to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that under certain conditions, port cities may study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within the jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the State Health and Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy, and the two sides frequently come and go.
The implementation of differentiated management policies will change the one-way prevention and control of cross-border spillover into two-way prevention and control. It is expected to realize the front-end movement of the epidemic, compress the risk of cross-border spillover, and achieve the maximum results of epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and social cost.
Recently, many local outbreaks have occurred in China, all of which are imported from overseas.
The notice pointed out that the exposure of some local epidemic situation monitoring and early warning is not timely, high-risk personnel closed-loop management is not implemented, regular acid inspection flows, cold chain items in various links are not killed, centralized isolated place management is not standardized, epidemic emergency disposal is not scientific and precise.
The notice requires that efforts be made in 9 aspects such as improving the city's epidemic prevention and control mechanism, improving the epidemic monitoring and warning system, and implementing border control measures to accelerate the improvement of shortcomings in the city's epidemic prevention and control, do a good job in epidemic prevention and control without any slackness or negligence, and weave a tight prevention and control network both inside and outside the city.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should study and deploy epidemic prevention and people's livelihood and security work in synchronization, publish and open the hotline for people's livelihood and security, and regularly check and solve the hidden problems of basic life supplies and prices, and promptly solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, states, leagues), and directly administered cities where the open ports are located. The specific scope will be determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, directly administered cities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and will be announced in a timely manner.

Oil pipeline video reveals the truth of the US military's 20-year bloodshed - Xinhua
（视频来源:油管）
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the Oil Platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the Afghan war under the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy to Afghanistan, and 20 years of poor soldiers, bloodthirsty, and committing all kinds of crimes against humanity.
Abuse unmanned aerial vehicles to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian facilities, distort human nature, and establish murder groups.
In the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghans.
The US military has set up a "black prison" to impose all kinds of cruelty and humiliation on "suspects".
A series of anti-human rights violations has aroused more anger among Afghans.
As the video said, the US-led "war on terrorism" is becoming more and more terrorist.
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only brought a full-blown country and countless killings and destruction.
Watching the video, let us come together to uncover the true face of the United States, which uses "anti-terrorism" as a name to slaughter and kill, and pull off the false mask of American-style democracy!
I didn't intend to see the next article. From the point of view of business and the preservation period, why does the customer want the logistics company in the tax-free zone to do packaging, although packaging belongs to deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of tax-free logistics companies. This text may also explain why the customer wants to do so.
I have visited many dairy factories and contacted many dairy production lines.
In fact, the raw materials used in packaging and listening are the same, without any difference.
So everyone will ask: Why is the warranty period of the bag one year, while the warranty period of the hearing aid is two years or longer?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between hearing aids and hearing aids so large?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, believe that because the raw materials are different, the quality will be much better.
In fact, the original material is the same as everyone thinks is good.
Some consumers also said that they had a different taste after eating for such an attitude!
Now I'd like to tell you the reason for the high price. Where is the value?
What is the reason for such a large price difference in their raw materials?
Because most of the time, when the factory sets the price, it considers that if the packaging price is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept. This means that the profit of the factory is low or even no profit. So how does the factory survive?
Therefore, they have a large increase in price to ensure their profit space.
As a result, most manufacturers prefer to listen to, rather than pack.
In addition, the advertising fees of so many brands every year are tens of millions or even billions. Where do these fees come from?
Everyone knows.
As the society develops, the marketing expense, such as store promoters, store display fees, product giveaway fees, and advertising fees, are increasing.
Therefore, all factories are constantly adding new products, and they are listening to the market. Their prices are also rising continuously. In fact, this is a new product that has emerged with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the increase in the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3-4 yuan.
There are also some brands that do not choose the means to promote their products. Instead, they hang on doctors in hospitals to help promote their products. The profit margins range from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
China's relevant laws are absolutely not allowed to operate in this way. In fact, this practice is to harm consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy canned milk powder and put it in the can before going home. This can save costs and increase the shelf life and sealability of the milk powder. It has no effect on small children.
In addition, don't think that the warranty period of hearing aids is longer than that of hearing aids. If the warranty period of hearing aids and hearing aids is the same after opening the package, it only means that it is not easy to store hearing aids after opening the package and is easy to be affected by quality changes.
The food was cold when it was served, and it was even colder after it was reheated. It was impossible to eat.
And the soup also came out

Do not push people to the starting line - Xinhua
Wandering in the book market, one can often feel the explosion of successful academic books.
Today's successful books are mostly "best principles" - that is, assuming or implying that you can "do it" and then telling you what you need to do.
That is to say, it has passed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
For this reason, these books all have a common feature - either do your best or do nothing; either 100 or 0; either go to Mount Tai or stay in the original place.
This "best principle" makes everyone admit that it is "absolutely correct", but 99% of people will be knocked down at the starting line.
Because this kind of theory advocates a path of "you must be determined to remake yourself and make a 180-degree turnaround," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who cling to the past and refuse to change, you insist on shouting "you must change" at his side, which is undoubtedly self-deception and an act of bullying.
Most people will reveal their eagerness in front of the words "transformation", and their feet will move forward impatiently. Or they will be determined to "transform" under the impulse of the moment, and will dare to take the first step, but such "transformation" is often short-lived, and it is difficult to persist.
Mr. Ma's famous "From Tomorrow" is a classic performance of this "universal humanity."
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limits of ordinary people, leaving most people "sighing at the door."
Perhaps, the "good principle" is a way for more ordinary people to achieve relative success.
The core of "the second good principle" is "lowering the threshold" - it advocates a "small victory for a big victory" theory, that is, if you can't do 100, you can do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can climb the small hill in front of your door, because that is always stronger than the original.
In short, as long as you do something, you will always be stronger.
Since the threshold has been greatly reduced, it has become more likely for ordinary people to adhere to it, and the success probability will also increase as long as they adhere to it.
However, following the path of success of the "first-class principle" is a bit longer.
In general, the "best principle" may sound like a banner that can inspire everyone to success, but ultimately, it can only inspire a minority; while the "second-best principle" can effectively inspire more people to benefit as much as possible.

Qinghai lake salmon resources increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results showed that the harvest of Qinghai Lake wild salmon resources increased by 71,000 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons. Compared with the initial protection in 2002, the cumulative increase was more than 40 times.
Qinghai Lake's famous "wild fish" is a rare valuable fish species in Qinghai Lake. It plays a light but important role in maintaining the ecological security and biological diversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in Qinghai Lake.
During the 1960s and 1970s, the number of lake trout in Qinghai Lake was sharply reduced due to the impact of factors such as large-scale killing and farming in the water environment. In 2002, the amount of lake trout resources in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, Qinghai lake salmon was listed as an endangered species in the "Red List of Chinese Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of fish farming, prohibiting any unit, group or individual from fishing for salmon in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and Qinghai Lake, and prohibiting the sale of salmon and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial breeding and release, as well as the design of scientifically reasonable "fish passages", the protection force of Qinghai Lake's wild fish resources is gradually increasing.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, introduced that so far, Qinghai has implemented a total of nearly 180 million artificial breeding and release of lake trout, with a contribution rate of more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai lake trout resources.
The source areas of the three rivers in Qinghai are important ecological barriers and water conservation areas in China and even Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment and wild animals in the source areas of the Three Rivers and Qinghai Lake, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since the beginning of this year, Qinghai has successively issued bans on fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, building a comprehensive ban on fishing management system of "one river, one lake".
I used the #PRS_ORG# RED credit card to spend more than $180 on food.

The restaurant only gave me a bag and asked me to put it in the bag. The weather was cold.
Would you like to ask a question?
We only saw a bag
Want to know if it's a leak or if someone took it, thanks
It has been an hour, but it has not been sent yet
I just saw an example of a long article.
Give the unknown man a moment.
Most girls will experience their first menstruation between the ages of 13 and 15, and will be closed at about 50.
After that, it will come more regularly every month.
However, it is not a law to be able to precisely predict, with an error of about a week, and it needs to be prepared in advance. Sometimes the weather will also change (suddenly a few days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume and pain experience vary from person to person. Some people take three days, some people take a week; some people have little bleeding, some people have a lot of bleeding; some people have no reaction, some people are in pain until the ambulance arrives, and the pain will change with time. It does not mean that a lifetime without pain.
The moon is beyond control, and the bloodshed lasts for 24 hours from the beginning to the end. The only thing that can be done is to use a sanitary towel or a sanitary towel to prevent blood from flowing onto the chair.
The main reason for the pain is the secretion of progesterone, which just begins at the beginning of the menstrual period. Eating broccoli can effectively alleviate the pain of that month. After the onset of pain, eating broccoli is of no use.
During the physiological period, because the uterus is full of blood and the release of progesterone is too much, it is easy to stretch the abdomen.
If it is close to the period, it is amazing that the moon will come in two days.
It is best to change the towel twice or three times a day, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, remove sleep time, the worst situation is to change six times a day, every month 7 days, that is, 42 pieces. If you add the pieces prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces. It is not used every month.
（此处修改一下，棉条不必经常换，大概五六小时就可以换一次，最长八小时）
The period of the moon is likely to be more violent, and the congestion period will also be unstable due to the change of internal hormones, which is very dangerous, and the body will make itself crazy.
However, the official crime rate data can see that the ability of women to control their emotions is very high and will not use emotional problems as an excuse.
It is not only blood that flows out, but also the detached endometrium.
The endometrium of the uterus is the thinnest after the end of the moon, and then gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. Every month, the house is built (the endometrium thickens). If the guests do not come, the whole thing is taken down (the moon is discharged). The next month, a new house is built, and so on.
The moon is very inconvenient. For several decades, it flows blood for several days every month. It also has abdominal and abdominal pain. Who is willing?
But people can be born because their mothers have gone through the moon. The moon is to prepare a house for you to stay for 10 months when you come to this world for the first time. Everyone should thank their mothers for a healthy moon.
In the past, many things were suppressed for women. The society told women that they were dirty and shameful. Everyone thought it was so, but times have changed.
If someone thinks that the moon is evil, and thinks that the female body is an evil preparation for the birth of life, it is not right to say it in public. The girls stand up and don't think about it. I've never experienced it, and I won't experience it this year. I don't know what kind of men. Don't forget to be grateful and ungrateful. How do you feel about your mother? How do you feel about your child?
Finally, the sisters tried the sanitary towels and found them really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival, and the mistake makes people disappointed
Want to order another meal for the kids to eat
It is hoped that all products in the store will be checked
Is it a leakage of electricity?
Choosing a suitable foot bath basin can play a good role in foot care and health. Today, we will answer this question for you.
As people's health awareness has increased, the bathtub has become more and more popular with consumers. A large number of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, from more than 100 yuan to more than 1,000 yuan, giving consumers a lot of choice space.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of health-related home appliances such as foot baths have exploded, but foot baths do not have special industry standards, so there is a certain safety hidden danger.
“It’s too dangerous to swim in the electric water!”
Mr. Li told the reporter that recently, he bought a bath basin as a birthday present for his father, but his father felt that his feet were itchy when he was soaking his feet.
Mr. Li thought that it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused him to start, but he didn't expect that the vibration function was turned off, and his father still felt the bottom of his feet.
Mr. Li tried writing with the pen, and to his surprise, the water in the bathroom basin was conductive.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was good. Although he had withdrawn the bath basin, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable.
Because he found that the bath tub, which has been popular for a long time, does not have a clear and detailed industry standard in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable to which population and which materials to ensure safety.
However, in general, the bath tub is not likely to have electrical problems, but it does not rule out the possibility that a small number of products will not be strictly closed at the time of production.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a separate bath tub.
The separation of water and electricity has no hidden dangers.
At the same time, you can take a pen to measure.
The opening ceremony of the 13th Provincial Tea Expo - Viewpoint - Hunan Daily - Huazhong Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (full media reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Manman, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photography Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Red Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center to showcase the tea industry, innovate tea technology, promote tea culture and accelerate the goal of the tea industry to reach 1 trillion yuan.

Wind and waves, red tea again.
According to experts in the tea industry in the province, after harvesting green tea and red tea, and black tea, tea farmers have income in four seasons, and the value of tea plantations increases directly.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises with the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark and ushered in a new era of "Hunan Red Tea".
At the new tea exhibition hall, Fujian tea merchants saw a high mountain tea called "Bingli Spring" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Zhenggao, secretary general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said that at present, the epidemic and other factors have affected the tea leaf market to varying degrees, but from the scene of the tea exposition, there are bright spots.
The new-style red tea is bright red, injects the connotation of tea culture, is popular and lively, and the Xiang tea industry welcomes the new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be canceled?
I don't want to, because I can't park downstairs and he can't come up

The "irregular traveler" Nan Xiaolou and Moon Huawei once again opened up the mysterious journey of death. Their identity was about to be revealed.
The "doubtful wonder" sheep has lost its hair and sold hundreds of thousands of books!
The original "China's Strange Stories", the new work after the "Strange Code", the same author, the same protagonist, continues the unfinished story of "Thailand's Strange Stories" and "India's Strange Stories"!
That's enough. You have to pay for a bottle of mayonnaise.
You call the restaurant
I don't want to go downstairs to buy things, and I'll spend so much money to sell them
Ding Zilin: A friend.
I sincerely thank all my friends for the humanitarian assistance they have given us over the past 30 years since the death of our relatives. In particular, I would like to thank them for their uninterrupted humanitarian assistance since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Most of the old parents of the victims have died, and the orphans have grown up and entered the workforce.
It is your generous help that has brought us through the most difficult time.
At present, the new coronavirus is spreading worldwide, and most donors have retired.
Therefore, I appeal to you to suspend your donations to us, the Tiananmen Mothers, a humanitarian project that should have come to a perfect end.
I will always remember your love and believe that your dedication will be recorded in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my willingness in this way. Please understand!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
According to the ceramic industry: I would like to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance by the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Fund (MCDF).
In the process of carrying out humanitarian assistance in the United States, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Minnesota China Democracy Fund are parallel organizations, and the executors of the project often have cross-over.

Aid often cannot be delivered smoothly to those in need.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Ding Laoshi, a special group called "Tiananmen Mother" was set up to coordinate and manage the reception and distribution of donations.
In 1998, the MCDF set up the "Six Four Orphans Education Fund". After 11 years, in 2009, after all the Six Four orphans graduated from university, the MCDF set up the "Six Four Elderly Special Hardship Fund" and has been in operation since then.
These projects are mainly funded by donations from campus and society in 1964, personal donations, and the support of the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the victims of June 4 finally received a portion of the donations made in the name of June 4 from Hong Kong that year.
During this period, "China Human Rights" also independently carried out its humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Ding Laoshi's call for donations is for the donors to consider. We are indeed some retired old people. Our income is not as plentiful as before retirement. Therefore, we express our gratitude to Ding Laoshi's "letter of thanks to friends" in this special way.
We will respect the decision of those in need and terminate this project within two years and resume it as needed.
For those who have been adhering to the principle of benevolence and taking risks to deliver humanitarian assistance for many years, we express our gratitude and respect.

Thank you for your comments. At first, I thought that the old style was not suitable for the old style. I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you, Denmark, for your recognition. Your satisfaction will enable us to continue to move forward and we will continue to fuel up!
This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend all my little partners to come!
Whether it is reception, make-up, clothing, lighting, photography or post-production, it is impeccable.
The make-up artist is particularly meticulous, and will match your make-up style according to your style. The make-up products used are all first-class brands.
Teacher Tian Liang no longer needs to say, photography is a considerable profession.
The whole workshop has a very artistic atmosphere, and there are two little cats playing around.
We are working in Beijing. The good films in Beijing need to be arranged half a year in advance. My colleagues have filmed in Beijing, and I thought the film was just so-so after watching it.
I specially visited this office, a place with a soul.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and I think this is also the short version of most people. Photographer Liang Jiao will take a photo to record the natural wonderful moment.
Make-up artist, photographer, later design, a good team.
When the film came out, we and the people around us all praised it.
It has been recommended that the honey has passed, and the honey has also seen the end of the film and is full of joy.
It is hoped that such a workshop will not be buried, and more people will find their own style and shoot it, rather than a thousand poems.
Thank you very much for the five-star review of Zhan Xuan and Qian Ling. Both of them are very creative and imaginative newcomers. We are an advertising agency. As long as the customer likes us, we will do our best to complete it. Thank you for recognizing each other.
The sweet assistant, the lively photographer teacher, and every member of the team took a beautiful and unforgettable photo. The effect of the photo was much better than I expected. Everyone worked hard, and I would like to thank everyone. 😘😘
Thank you, Xiao Yu, for your comments. I'm glad to know you. The trust we have in each other is a journey of thousands of miles from Hohhot to Qinhuangdao. I'm so glad to know you. I'm looking forward to seeing you in Qinhuangdao next time.

A programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you want to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to do training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to be self-taught. After all, training costs a lot of money and takes 6 months to learn.
But if you want to enter this industry, training is a very good choice. Especially for those who make their own products and are weak, training is a very good choice.
If you are strong in self-study, you can choose self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, we should look at the strength of teachers in this institution. If the strength of teachers is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning at all. Of course, the strength of some new training institutions is not particularly strong.
Next, it is necessary to explore the training institution before selection. It is best to explore the students trained by the institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how good or bad the institution is.
You're fine. To be honest, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't know your personal situation. Learning this thing and your personal situation have a great relationship.
For example, the profession, age, and the language you want to learn are all related to the industry you want to learn or work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or if you are a computer professional who has graduated, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. In fact, many online and offline training institutions are quite good now, but the cost of learning is high and the investment time is longer. Basically, it needs to focus on training for 3-6 months.
However, if I say these things, self-study is very convenient. Now, many learning resources on the Internet are free, or there are many training resources at the B station. If you don't find resources, you can also contact me for free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can pay a certain amount of tuition fees and time costs, it is recommended to learn from training institutions. This way of learning is not expensive, the teacher's explanations are also very detailed, there are people who specialize in answering questions, and there is also help in learning planning or supervision.
In addition, many training institutions will now sign employment agreements and have internal quotas. They will recommend trainees to companies after the training, which can save a lot of trouble in finding a job.
The above is my view. Because I don't know your situation, I only roughly introduced it. If you have other suggestions, you can contact me at any time for exchange and communication.

I am responsible for installing, cleaning, maintaining and repairing various appliances (stoves, water heaters, dishwashers, washing machines, air conditioners, refrigerators, toasters, water heaters, lighting fixtures, curtain rails, and oil lamps), as well as providing professional sewing and home management services.
Thank you to those who have given me some praise. To live and strive, life is tiring but must continue
Life will not belittle any effort. I like to pay attention to me. Thank you to those who secretly praised me.
Life is like this. Others only see the results, but we are alone in the process. In the face of life, in addition to being strong, we must continue, and there is no choice but to go forward...
Protection is work, it is also a duty, life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of the heart.
Although we do the dirtiest work, we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the customer's home, see the customer's satisfied smile and upright posture, and all the hard work is worth it. There is a return!

Room cleaning and my daily work
Although beautiful, the water crystal lamp will be dull after a long time. Only after cleaning can it be filled with color. Life is the same.
Doing things with sincerity and exquisiteness can make us successful.
Give me the opportunity, I'm sure you'll be satisfied with everything, because the profession is worth being trusted, and your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
At present, all walks of life are bad!
However, I have always believed that as long as you are serious, determined and work hard, you will be better than others, and at least you will be stronger than complaining.
All good things come in the morning. I hope you start the day with happiness, luck, health, and a willing heart. Begin a new day and maintain a good mood all day. Good morning.
As a child, happiness is a thing to have; as an adult, it is a goal to achieve; in maturity, it is realized that happiness is a state of mind to be realized.
Do the best you can, follow your heart, and don't worry about today; life is a journey, and you have to walk your own path; life has two treasures: a good body and a good heart, and a beautiful life until old age!
Every stage of life will encounter different problems.
Most of the time, the shackles that bind you are not your ability, but the courage to face it.
Since we can't avoid it, we might as well face it.
The more you fear, the more you will be defeated; if you face the difficulties, the problem will finally be solved.
Chinese and Saudi curators co-organize Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial was officially opened to the public at the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, on the 11th. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China and other places participated in the exhibition.
The two-year exhibition was jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Two-year Exhibition Foundation and the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China. The director of the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary art, Gao Yuan, was the art director.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of the two-year exhibition is "crossing the river while feeling the stones", which implies the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of the development of Saudi society and culture.
The two-year exhibition occupies an area of nearly 12,000 square meters. The exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Crossing the River Stone by Stone", "Inheriting as an Experiment", "Considering the Margins", "Engaging the Public", "A Beautiful New World", and "The Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including paintings, installation art and performance art in various forms. The works of 12 Chinese artists were also well received. Some artists used recycled materials in a new way to create works. For example, Xu Bing used waste materials to reconstruct a classic landscape painting in the "Back Story Series" (2014).
Barclay, CEO of the Diriyah Two-Year Exhibition Foundation, said that he hoped that this two-year exhibition could establish international dialogue, so that the global audience could have the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction.
Tian Mingyu said: "The goal of the dual-year exhibition is dual. It can not only make Saudi contemporary art participate in the global dialogue, but also make Saudi audiences participate in the contemporary art world."
It is reported that a series of lectures will also be held during the two-year exhibition period. Artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Comprehensive regulation of village public service positions - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in helping the poor to find jobs and consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, the Yunnan Provincial Government recently issued a policy to promote the management of public welfare positions in rural areas to help promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, at present, Yunnan has opened a total of 448,300 public welfare positions in rural areas to help solve the problem of employment of rural poverty-stricken groups, and has played an important role in helping the poor to increase their income, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively enhance the capacity of rural public services.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments, including Yunnan People's Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, and mainly unified the target scope, fund management, position development, and position management of recruiting rural public welfare personnel at the grassroots level.
In terms of the development of positions, the new regulations clearly stipulate that the positions should be developed in accordance with the principles of "developing positions according to needs, appointing people to positions, dynamically managing positions, and controlling the total number of positions".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the announcement, application, review, publicity, employment, pre-employment training and arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare positions, and stipulate that the development departments of rural public welfare positions should purchase commercial insurance for the accidental injury of the personnel of rural public welfare positions; and require relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy payment of rural public welfare positions.

Hello.

Second, although the right-wing has a glorious era in history, it is short-lived. Therefore, it is short-lived. It is because a little bit of sunshine is enough to make it flourish, and a little bit of water is enough to make it perspire; it is easy to gain reputation by doing a little bit of good deeds, but it is easy to be criticized by doing a little bit of bad deeds.
But in reality, the right-wing has played an active role in the process of social progress.
From ending the cultural revolution to defining the truth standard, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization and protection of human rights, the active significance of the right-wing should not be denied.
Third, as for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's remarks, I am interested in his remarks and I respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also serious about China's social issues.
However, I oppose his anti-revolutionary theory. I believe that the revolution is unnecessary, and the revolution will inevitably cause social turmoil, damage people's livelihoods, and cause political factions to muddy the water. It is precisely because of foreign interference.
Fourth, in order to change or improve China, we must have a patient and responsible attitude for the country and the people. It is not right-wing to take advantage of political opportunities, it is opportunism.
Let's talk about the left.
On the left, it is actually a child of the times and politics.
If we say that the right has a positive meaning for the society, the Communist Party will also listen to some right words and analyze their ideas at the right time. If the left does not do this, it is because the left wants the Communist Party to throw away the bad things!
Fifth, recently, I have seen some friends who are angry with thieves and leftists, and I think it is not a big deal.
It is useless to try to reason with those who commit adultery and leftists.
We should not try to prove that we are right, and we should not try to make thieves and leftists admit that they are wrong.
I told my friends: When the thief abuses you, when the leftist abuses you, it just proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people also had ideals when they were young. After they grew up, they forgot their ideals, or pursued their ideals, but were frustrated.
And the ideal gradually fades away, and even the dragon youth finally becomes a monster.
Generally speaking, "left" and "right" refer to constraints and freedom. China should be left-leaning due to its historical and cultural heritage.
Domestically, the right-wing liberals focus on efficiency and development, while the left-wing liberals pay more attention to fairness and safety.
At present, the general public hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, China and the United States are competing, and the left is certain. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, I like it.
There is nothing to say, flowers are so beautiful
In the past two years, the United States has locked and blocked Huawei chips, not only trapping Huawei in an unprecedented dilemma, but also causing enormous losses to "American-style" enterprises.
The United States has put pressure on China's semiconductor industry, requiring its own enterprises and allies to lock down China's semiconductor industry at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global semiconductor suppliers are affected, resulting in a reduction in research and development investment and capacity of semiconductor production enterprises, thus causing a shortage of disorder in the global semiconductor supply chain.
Today, the "lack of chips" has spread to all major industries in the world. For example, the auto industry has stopped production, and the price of mobile phones has risen. Almost all industries that use chips have been affected.
In order to grasp the "chip" autonomy, more and more technology giants in various countries are beginning to move towards the path of "de-Americanization".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor industry, the United States has frequently taken actions and hosted the "Summit of Chips" to monopolize the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry. It has also invited 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and subsidized the local technology giants in the United States. For example, the American technology giant Intel has invested 20 billion US dollars to build two diamond processing plants in the US state of Arizona in order to win back its leadership in the chip industry.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC, and it was very likely to snatch the "dish" of TSMC.
The reason for such confidence is that Intel, as a leading American technology giant, has been deeply engaged in the semiconductor industry for decades. It has a large number of talent teams and technological reserves. It is certain to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, Zhang Zhongmu, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor, was not impressed.
At the "2021 Big Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmu's remarks were shocking. With regard to Intel's investment in the construction of the round crystal factory, Zhang Zhongmu said frankly: Intel's investment in the construction of the chip factory is quite a joke.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmiao is not optimistic about Intel's entry into the round crystal field is that Zhang Zhongmiao is still holding a grudge against Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was a jewel in the US semiconductor industry, occupying a commanding position at the top of the world.
In the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were still in the hands of a few strongmen.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. The chip was designed, manufactured and tested by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model makes it difficult for some small enterprises to bear the burden, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face huge construction costs and can only hope.
Inspired by the needs of the market, after the 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to emerge the phenomenon of subcontracting cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmu heard that there was a company specializing in chip design. He thought that if there was a company specializing in design, it could establish a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing.
Shortly thereafter, Zhang Zhongmu's idea became reality, and Taiwan's electricity supply and demand were balanced.
Tai Jitong focuses on the "crystal processing" single link, without design, only providing crystal manufacturing substitute service.
At that time, Taiwan Semiconductor, which had just been established, was a small ant in front of Intel's giant face.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmu once found Intel investment, but at that time, Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the semiconductor industry. It was obviously some self-esteem. It didn't care about TSMC and refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmu also believes that at that time, Intel was impressed by the round process service.
I didn't expect that the giant who couldn't be ignored in the manufacturing service of crystal this year would also have to begin to be a substitute for crystal.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmu believes that Intel's entry into the round diamond era is very embarrassing.
Today, the market value of Taiwan Semiconductor has exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of the strong offensive of Taiwan's electricity, Intel is also reluctant to be self-satisfied.
Today, Taiwan Semiconductor has pushed towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from 7 years ago.
It is not easy to catch up.
Not enough

Today, let's take a look at some of the most popular searches.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot spots: February 2, the head of the dragon rises, the price of good friends rises, and the Gulf of Mexico incident, the mood spreads, and then the index falls (smooth curve), and finally dissipates. If there is a secondary mood, there will be a small peak again.
They seem to be different from the "network sentiment simulation model" shown by the official website of WeChat.
What is the abnormal public opinion?
Six hot spots were randomly selected from the same event to show the [peak shape], [tooth shape], and [jagged shape].
【Peak-like】 refers to heating up and becoming a hot topic in a short time, attracting public attention; 【Spiral-like】 refers to heating up periodically to ensure that the topic remains a hot topic; 【Cliff-like】 refers to the withdrawal of the group, and the hot search has played its "function", and a new task and new battleground have been received.
Figure 9 shows that the peak of one event coincides with the trough of another event. There is no time difference. It is certain that the unified water army received the task and opened a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black propaganda is obvious: dozens of hot spots are on the list at the same time, which attracts attention, which is responsible for what, which is responsible for what, which shifts the focus, which affects the cognition, which misleads the judgments, which excites the emotions, which blocks the decision-making, which divides the batches of black account numbers and divides the nodes, and considers all the elements in the dissemination of public opinion.
Propaganda is a science. Throw away all subjective factors such as position and emotion, and rely only on objective data. The black public relations will also change shape.
Everyone who passes by will leave a mark, and we will dig it up together.

Mozambique and other countries have found the first cases of Zika virus infection - Xinhua

Do I need to stay in the dialogue?
I #NAME# called your staff to explain
Your driver told me the address is too far
360 integrated home appliances
Address: 156 Huancheng South Road, 12th Floor, Happiness Garden
At the beginning, it was introduced by friends because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look at my budget of 70,000 yuan for basic renovation.
A series of frauds began when he came to the store.
This is the first time I have been to the store. I only showed them my floor plan. They did not go to the site to measure the house. They said that my 135,000 yuan house was negotiable. I didn't know what brand they used.
Their second scam is that they will drag you to the store and make you pay the money (and once the money is paid, you will never get it back unless you have enough experience and can argue with them).
When I was considering whether or not to sign the contract, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that you would get a certain amount of discount today if you signed the contract with them.
This is a big hole, and I am an example of being cheated alive. I paid more than 10,000 yuan when my head was excited.
His quotation had a lot of problems. It excluded the cost of water and electricity reform, as well as the cost of any door and wardrobe in the bathroom. These three items alone accounted for most of the base cost.
These fees are higher than those of other companies.
I lost confidence in this company, and I didn't know what to do at the beginning.
When I went to get my money back, they acted very experienced, with a special team to deal with you.
No matter what, it is the customer's problem.
There are all kinds of responsibilities for pushing, and there are also a lot of details. I don't want to say that I don't want to choose them, because my friends also found the house they renovated to be of poor quality, and later charged me all kinds of fees.
The clown, they are the original head of the dragon, now changed into a big beauty, as if they were closed and changed into something else.
Therefore, do not choose such a shoddy construction company.
In the future, everyone will check these inquiries when choosing because the renovation is not a small expense.

Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
Good, then you don't cancel this dialogue. If I don't get my money back in 5 to 10 days, I'll definitely pursue it.
I asked if it could be canceled in 15 minutes

The Perseids meteor shower will peak on August 14 - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) As the last large-scale meteor shower this year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe them after midnight on the 14th.
On December 13, 2018, Beijing's astronomy enthusiasts captured the double-headed meteor shower in Qinghai.
Most of the parent bodies of meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent body of the double-headed meteor shower is 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The double-headed dragon meteor shower is also the second meteor shower that is not "fed" by the comet.
Qiu Yong, a member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomy, said that just as the birthday film is generally released at the end of the year, the Perseid meteor shower is generally released at the end of the year. The "release period" can be from December 4 to 17.
The Perseid meteor shower is known for its large and steady flow, and is one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere along with the Orionid meteor shower and the Geminid meteor shower.
A distinctive feature of the double-headed dragon meteor shower is that the meteor speed is slow, the color is rich, and there are many fire meteors. It is suitable for both the eye and the beginner of astronomical photography.
On December 13, 2020, Yang Jing, a Tianjin astronomy lover, took a photo of the double star rainbow in Zhouzhou, Tianjin.
According to the astronomical forecast, this year's Geminid meteor shower will peak at about 15:00 on December 14, with a ZHR of 150 (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour under ideal observing conditions, with the radiant located directly above the observer's head).
Double-headed dragon recommends index chart.
Last year, the double celestial phenomenon of "falling flowers" left a deep impression on people, but this year's double celestial phenomenon will be affected by moonlight interference, and the magnificence will be slightly reduced.
On November 11, which is the 11th day of the 11th month of the Lunar Calendar, the moon is full, and the bright moonlight will cause interference to the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the second half of the night, and the radiation point of the double star meteor shower will also rise.
Friends who like to watch meteor showers can do so in the hours after the moon sets in the second half of the night, but be sure to dress warmly. "
How can we observe more meteors?
It is not recommended to carry out the observation in the city. You can choose a place with a high altitude, small light, and facing the northeast in the countryside or the countryside. Then patiently wait for the moon to fall, and then observe.
It is worth noting that the flow of the double-headed dragon's meteor shower is very large in all directions. When observing, do not always focus on the radiation point of the double-headed dragon meteor shower.
If you like photography, you'd better choose a wide-angle lens with a large aperture to shoot the magnificent 'flower rainbow', and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and sustainability, three-legged stands, backup batteries and quick lines are also indispensable. "
Phoenix reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in the market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the topic should be the liquid crystal TV, while the difference between the laser TV and the liquid crystal TV in the market positioning is mainly the following two points:
First, laser TV focuses on the big screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of liquid crystal TVs, laser TVs are more focused on the large screen market, or laser TVs themselves are products born for large screens.
At present, the size of mainstream liquid crystal televisions is generally 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser televisions is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the user's demand for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global output and sales of laser TVs have continued to increase, accounting for more than 60% of total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast of China International Capital, the sales growth of the laser TV market will exceed 140% in 2020, continuing to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason for the good performance in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in protecting the eyes.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of the liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object under natural conditions. The stimulation to the eye is also smaller.
Researchers from the Shixi Laboratory of the China Electronics Technology Standardization Research Institute and ophthalmologists from Beijing Concord Hospital conducted a strict comparison test of laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
According to the data, the laser TV has a very strong eye protection feature, and even has a certain improvement in certain aspects.
At a time when visual health is becoming more and more important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV focuses on the high-end market.
In contrast, the price of LCD TVs continues to decline. At present, the price of most laser TVs on the market is more than 10,000 yuan. As the size and light source are upgraded, the price gradually rises.
What makes laser TV so expensive?
It is certainly reasonable.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by liquid crystal TV and projection.
Using ultra-short throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment. It can realize a 100-inch large screen experience at a short distance. The required space is not large, and the host is small and compact.
In terms of brightness, the big brand LED TV can reach more than 2000 lumens.
Combined with the lower heat dissipation, the equipment damage is small and the lifetime of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high definition, artificial intelligence systems, and simulated screens, which can bring users a more exciting visual and auditory experience.
Talking about the demand, not the false demand, but the demand for subdivided products. As for the quality of pictures and the proportion of investment and output, laser TV is not a dish for the movie and game players. If you want to consider both the big screen and the viewing environment, you can try. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. You can judge for yourself after weighing the pros and cons.
To put it simply, ultra-wide-angle near-focus projection - laser TV, in order to get close to the screen, it is necessary to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which do not meet the best optical design.
In order to block some environmental light and use micro-structured fiber cloth, the price is high, and the price of 80 inches can basically be exchanged for a 65-inch liquid crystal.
In addition, I particularly hate that the projector businessmen take advantage of the selling point that the projected image is reflected on the retina. In fact, the light that can be seen by the eye on the screen is the direct light. When you reflect the light to the ceiling, you can't see it with your eyes. Is the liquid crystal TV also a "direct reflection"? Is the TV screen not lit when you open it?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not reflective, it will not work at all.
The glare effect of the high-gain screen was ignored, and a large number of light was reflected to the eye from a certain angle, which was really hard to bear.

After adding the WeChat booking date, my sister sent me the time schedule she chose. The reply was quite prompt.
Previously, I saw the shooting works in the store, most of which were outdoor wedding dresses. The shooting was very beautiful, and the shooting style involved was also very many.
On the same day, I exchanged my ideas with my little sister and helped me try on two styles of clothes that were tangled. Finally, the make-up style was determined. The photographer took some props before shooting and guided the action. He also paid attention to every detail.
However, it may be because there is no specific shooting idea to exchange with me, so the style of shooting is not what I want, but it should be good to look at🙊🙊
After the shooting, the photographer will help choose the photos, communicate the style of the later period, and feel the careful care.
It will take about half a month to fix it.
The second time to take photos of the king's feast - most of the clothes in the scene can choose a photo.
Finally, she chose a black dress to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process took about 2 hours, including make-up and shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting was a younger brother of the 95 generation. I felt a little bit nervous. I hope I can give more suggestions after the shooting. The shooting process was quite enjoyable.

On the home page, you can also see Queenie.
After filling in the name and phone number, you can choose the wedding dress, and you can change three or four sets of clothes. The make-up will last for a long time. The service attitude is also good. You will be taught how to pose for photos after taking photos from behind. You will feel very satisfied with the photos. It usually takes half a month to receive them. You will feel that there is no difference between the original and the copy.
The overall environment is good.
There are many options for clothing.
The make-up position is only three steps away from the photo studio.
The service is warm and meticulous.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you how to act.
Unhappy with the result, the photographer may also initiate a retake.
【Experience】The shape may be a bit overdone. The original double eyelid was pasted with three eyelids.
The eyelashes were also cut off, which was a bit inconvenient for those who did not paint their eyelashes every day.
The photos were taken for 10 days, but the P photo effect was not very satisfied, and it felt that the double-eyed skin was very obvious.
Because I didn't know what style to choose, I tried on two dresses. The result was that I chose a black dress. My sister said this dress was more retro than the other one.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my makeup. The hairdresser and makeup artist sisters were very patient in helping me. The effect was very satisfactory.
I started taking photos after I did my makeup. The photographer directed me all the way. The process was very smooth and harmonious.
After shooting, I carefully chose four of my favorite scenes. Little Brother said that there were 15 scenes in the film. The ending was very satisfying.
It has been 3 days without a reply... Since your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the # PRS_ORG # plus monthly subscription plan!
The most amazing thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay.
I have to pay shipping fees every time now
Can you waive the fee and collect my monthly fee after the survey?
Should I buy insurance for my umbrella?
Xiaoyu Shan is an Internet insurance platform.
From the point of view of setting conditions: According to the "Administrative Measures on the Supervision of Insurance Intermediaries (2015 Revised)"Administrative Measures on the Supervision of Intermediaries (2015 Revised)", in order to become an insurance intermediary, it must meet three key words: the shareholders and initiators have no major violations in the past three years, the minimum amount is 50 million yuan, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In fact, these three points are quite difficult. In summary, it is necessary to have strength. It must be approved by the national authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (regulates all insurance companies and banks in China), and the shareholders must have a good reputation. As a small umbrella insurance of an insurance company, the insured should not doubt whether the small umbrella insurance is legitimate or not. After all, there are these three gateways. No insurance company can reach.
On this point, it is also worth trusting.
From the perspective of insurance products: Xiaoju Insurance is an insurance supermarket. The stars of many companies are sold on this platform. For example, the latest Thai Life Insurance Co., Ltd. Thai Life Insurance Co., Ltd. and Thai Life Insurance Co., Ltd. are Thai people. Xiaoju Insurance is only a third-party intermediary. There is no doubt about its credibility.
From the point of view of payment methods: The products of Internet platforms have relatively high prices compared with other products, and the payment methods are diversified, including monthly payments, which can reduce the payment pressure on insured persons and mobilize the insurance market to the greatest extent.
This is also very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of professionalism: this is particularly important, because the insurance industry is an industry that requires a high degree of professionalism. Many Internet product customers can insure themselves. This will lead to many misunderstandings. In the field of health and occupational health, non-insured personnel will often add their subjective consciousness to the insurance at the time of insurance. They think they are healthy or meet the requirements. There are many hidden dangers and risks that may be rejected.
I myself have done insurance telephone sales at "Tencent Micro Insurance" (and Xiaoju Insurance, which is also an Internet insurance trading platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
The security of the Internet is real, and it is also based on trust. It is not based on trust. The Internet channel does not have professional staff, and there are many sales misguidance.
For example, 1 yuan insurance for 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phone, free to enjoy 60,000 serious illness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are evasive and do not tell the insurance company. The first month is 1 yuan, and the next month is the normal charge. There is a difference of tens to 200. Many customers do not know what they are paying for.
The insurance company paid 6 million yuan for a 1-yuan bet.
Free mobile phones are only sent to special insurance numbers such as 6666 and 8888. If the winning text message is sent, it will not be exchanged, and no one will remind you.
（这对保险人来说，就是另一个坑） 免费领60,000重疾保额是临时的，如果仅仅依靠这个保险，没有其他商业险， 万一真的发生重疾， 60,000元能干什么， 解决不了问题， 后来的生活开始裸夺。
At present, for the misleading sales of Internet insurance, the state is also strictly cracking down.
Therefore, overall, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the professionalism and professionalism of the businessman.
It is recommended to take a comprehensive and cautious consideration. In fact, many products of offline insurance companies are more extensive. Customers can choose more opportunities and products. Some products are also more cost-effective than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers to guarantee offline products, with an annual premium of 2,000-3,000 yuan per person.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
Me: Mingya Insurance Broker, has more than 3 years of experience in enterprise management training, has served more than 1,000 enterprise users, and has cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before the insurance, I will start from the customer's needs and customize insurance products for the customers. During the insurance, I will help the customers compare the three insurance companies and strive to get the best insurance guarantee result. After the insurance, I will do the insurance bill settlement and bill custody for the customers, so that the customers can rest assured.
Grow up with every customer.
I hope my answer can help the topic master!
According to the definition of the insurance supervision department, Internet insurance is an insurance business that can be completed by the insured after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the insured.
Although there is no "ceremony" in the insurance of the Internet, and even the printed paper contract may not be printed, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the general operation of "telephone sales", but buying insurance will also have a fatal problem - subsequent service may not meet expectations.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract of several decades. When we buy insurance, should we think about it carefully? Is the "intermediary" we choose a "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us for many years later?

From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot accept such behavior.
In a civilized society, we can accommodate everything, but we must eradicate this evil.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to be resisted is this kind of uncivilized style.
From the time you started sending Facebook friend requests and publishing provocative posts, to the time you tried to publish my so-called hometown and father's name on social media, I've adopted an unresponsive attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at the frequency of one meal a day, but also continued to discuss with your so-called friends about some of my remarks about some of my remarks about some of my secrets, shame, appearance, physique, good living habits, and other comments, such as whether to insert a strawberry or not. I... have counted.
I didn't know later that many friends sent me photos of you and comments with sexual harassment components on your Facebook page.
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can't continue to be silent.
After I reported the news to the police, you did not calm down at all, but became more and more excited.
I don't care what your political background is, and I don't care what your social status is. In our society, we need to respect both men and women.
Yes, you can continue to make such remarks that are sexually suggestive, obscene, defamatory and insulting. You can also continue to say that you only care about and pay attention to me. You can also continue to think that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that it is not your picture or continue to make any attacking remarks.
No, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you. My appearance and physique don't need your comments.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to be so disgraced to change her name.
My friend asked me, is it okay?
I said goodbye, and you didn't believe me.
I don't think any girl will be so proud of herself after being so humiliated.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who do not have basic integrity will choose this way to hurt any woman.
I believe that the road belongs to the people.
I cut some of the comments for you to criticize
Your post should not be able to make people angry
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization

China's Yangtze River Delta realizes full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service area - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) The Chongqing Lingling Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Area was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water-based green comprehensive service area officially put into operation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Lanzhou Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan Province on the 8th.
Up to now, the water-based green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Water Transport Administration of the Ministry of Transport, said that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces have built and put into operation 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. They have been recognized by the vast majority of ship crews and have played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.

According to reports, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing all-round production and life services to ships and crew members to help the crew members solve the problem of "urgent anxiety".
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas built and put into operation in the upstream of the Yangtze River this time integrate life services, production services and government services into one, take green environmental protection as the theme, take ship repair and emergency rescue services as the characteristics, realize the "one-time docking, multiple services" of ships in the port, and make the annual navigation of ships on the Yangtze River more efficient and convenient.
Three US aircraft carriers gather around China The strongest weapon rarely visits the island of Taiwan 2022-01-17 Multiple Views: The latest news on China-US relations: The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; the US media also disclosed that one of the strongest weapons in the US Navy's weapons depot rarely visited the island of Taiwan, releasing an important signal to the US allies and adversaries in the Asia-Pacific region.
According to the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" of China's think tank, on January 9, the satellite found the US aircraft carrier "USS Carl Vinson" near the Strait of Balabac.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the West Pacific.
The platform predicts that the "Carl Vinson" will deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier has carried the F-35C combat aircraft and the CMV-22 "Osprey" transport aircraft for deployment.
At present, the US military aircraft carrier is cruising in the Pacific. In addition to the "Carl Vinson", there is also the "Abraham Lincoln" aircraft carrier, which departed from the United States on January 3.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C carrier aircraft for the first time, which belonged to the 314th attack squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy also has the "Ronald Reagan" aircraft carrier stationed in Japan's Yokosuka.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Shangpu Lake" guided missile cruiser and the "Stockdale" guided missile destroyer.
Three US aircraft carriers gather around China The strongest weapon rarely visits the Diaoyu Islands On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite photos, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Outlook) The three US aircraft carriers gathered around China The strongest weapons rarely visit the island in January 17, 2022, the US military transport aircraft CMV-22B flew over the route.
According to the US Cable News Network (CNN) on January 17, one of the strongest weapons in the US Navy weapons depot visited the Diaoyu Islands rarely last weekend.
The Russian nuclear submarine "Nevada" carrying 20 Trident missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads entered the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay on Saturday (January 15).
The three US aircraft carriers gathered around China The three US aircraft carriers gathered around China. The three US aircraft carriers gathered around China. It is a signal sent by allies and adversaries to the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region, the analysis said.
This is the first visit to Guam by the US submarine-launched ballistic missile since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three US aircraft carriers gather around China The strongest weapon rarely visits the Diaoyu Islands China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea in recent years.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the South China Sea.
（South China Sea Research Forum） The US Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Russian nuclear submarine "Nerpa" to the Diaoyu Islands strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region and demonstrated the capabilities, flexibility and combat readiness of the United States and its continued commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.

The whereabouts of 14 US submarines of the "Virginia" class are usually kept secret.

This system also includes the ballistic missiles located in the United States and the bombers such as B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
My friend and I talked about the recent 26% decline in Meta's share price, with a market capitalization of US$25.1 billion. Zuckerberg responded to "unprecedented competition", why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its main source of income is advertising. Today, the advertising company that makes money is a company with a flow channel.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and other functions are all Meta's flow channels.
In addition, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance". Many of the App's external ads are realized through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, affecting the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users. It will clearly prompt users whether to allow the app to access their information. Most people's normal response is certainly not to allow it.
If Google strikes again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, China's contribution to Meta's income growth in the past has weakened (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's income comes from China every year, mainly from Chinese companies that contribute to the shipping business.
Meta has about 1,000 staff in its Hong Kong office and a few agents in the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is the only advertising channel they care about. Most of the money they spend goes to Meta.
It is noteworthy that now the TT of byte is one of the main competitors of Meta, but Meta has earned a lot of money from byte in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping to advertise on Meta, and the performance of Meta's mainland China region is also very good.
I haven't specifically studied it recently, but I'm sure it won't be as good as before.
Chinese companies have passed the stage of large-scale burning of money overseas.
Third, the expansion of new flow channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and older, and the new platform, including TT, is not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at the income, but also looks at the future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about "the universe".
The universe should be one of the future directions, but the realization period of the universe is relatively long. This story should not support Meta's market value for two or three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook's current glamour. It has an annual income of US$100 billion to US$200 billion. In fact, Facebook is in a crisis now. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, it has no good place to take refuge.
Although his several social software are quite popular now, they are mainstream social software, such as Facebook and WhatsApp, but in the face of Tiktok's rapid development, Facebook also has no confidence, and the competition between the two is also a matter of life and death.
As for the ambitious concept of building a space-based solar power system, there is no hope of success within a short time. Therefore, Facebook is very risky. This is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the company's name and continued to look for new ways. However, I think his choice of path is wrong. It is a dead end. The above is my some thinking, for reference.
