The goods cost under 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# customer and therefore it is not a problem for me.
I only need one number or instruction on what I should do with the package so that it can be tracked as a return from you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a couple of days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179 euros.
I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and order it again for a better price or is there another way to get the discount?
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big brothers and sisters to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a quick look, help for a moment, bring the bottle etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are included.
As long as they still have enough children, I see no problem.
If your K1 is alone for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best determine whether this is suitable for your children.
It is not as if he should wrap up K2 and spend hours putting it to sleep.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is also the reason for the statement by the psychologist.
Because if something actually happens like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course your decision.
Could you please help me find the title of a book?
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title does not want to come to me at all, perhaps someone knows here...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by drowning himself in feed and going into the enclosure with his big cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation, gets in touch with his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and lands at this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of the suicide and document it and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and the patients ultimately face their fears in the most extreme way.
A woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to death on purpose)
This fight against fear is called "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with the fire.
This is the rough action I am quite sure that the book was written by a French author / author.
If this action is known to anyone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh, I don't have the password for the WiFi.
I have to contact my husband.
That can take a while.
What steps do I have to take now?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumb nail
Kind, four years, has wooden splinters under the thumb nail (outside).
They tried to pull it out with a pincer.
Very difficult to grasp.
Did not work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance.
Tomorrow I go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can thus be built into almost any locomotive of the track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are available with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker plus sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multiprotocol decoder.
He masters the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 gears are as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically report to a suitable digital centre.
He masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values on the main track can be read out.
For central stations that can only program the CVs of 1-255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 steps at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration with mfx®-compatible central stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake sections as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brake blocks or with DC voltage.
In addition, he also uses a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum train allows automatic pendulum between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC tracks.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to advance vaccination
Politics and science in Great Britain are always dealing with new Omikron cases.
All qualified adults in England should receive an immunization offer by New Year's.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster with the coronavirus booster vaccines in the face of rapidly rising omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
Until now, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to speed up the vaccination campaigns in the country's regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the Omikron variant, one is dealing with an emergency, which is why the vaccination protection must be urgently strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose.
Let's boost now, said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price at pickup?
I am in favor of everyone using pronouns
I have sent an application.
Today came the invitation to a conversation by mail.
I want to answer the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Could someone please help me?
** I am a foreigner and do not want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
4 of them go.
The only thing I bought today does not work
Obviously, the chair had a non-obvious flaw in sales.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
First on the #PRS_ORG#
This has been working for about.
14 days no longer.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books via the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 # PRS_ORG # and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I would like to add two chairs to your order and charge you for it.
CW The feeling when I can't help.
Warning: I will write something about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something from the soul.
As a 21-year-old, I often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs all too often is that many victims do not seek help or think we could not help them.
It is quite clear to me that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation with four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach everyone.
I do not know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to put up with violence.
I often wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
It will never become easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on youngster Johannes Patrick he could rely.
Again nothing: For the second time within less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick, with a view to the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
After the game, however, she did not go to bed - but again increased in the face of the 61:72 (28: 38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Which was even more disappointing than the bare result.
A representative statistic is one that expresses the entire dilemma: the three-point percentage was just 13 percent, they had four shots (all by young Johannes Patrick) and 31 attempts—are you still asking questions?
John Patrick gave the answer: "After the victory at Teneriffa we were simply not concentrated enough and did not implement what we trained."
To move the ball.
His counterpart, Sebastian Gleim, had a totally different reaction: "A great game to win again at Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
It felt like before 10,000 people.
Only 750 spectators were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered his team's game.
Gleim praised: "The best playmaker I have ever trained."
While in Patrick's team, the performance players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points after they had already lost 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for arguing.
Already on Wednesday (7 p.m.) the Giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have written to them again.
We had originally registered a half year ago.
Always like out of the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to thrill his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
At the moment he is touring with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "at the request of the authorities" to combat the coronavirus.
Several of his planned appearances during the Advent season will also have to be cancelled, as it says on the singer's website, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to catch up on their already postponed dates in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian town of Lünen, Max Raabe already sang a lot and with great pleasure as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place in the charts - just like his successful album "Women don't mind" (2013).
He has made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blond hair strictly backcombed and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer unnoticed in the current German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Through expropriation, no new housing is created
The new Federal Housing Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
With expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes, said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopolization.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left will set up an expert commission to deal with the result of the referendum.
But if the situation does not improve, Geywitz is not ruling out talks with the FDP in the grand coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake by 2029, a limit on rent increases in stressed housing markets and an expansion of the rent ceiling.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not unwind despite this, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has caused numerous tornadoes to move through the US.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be reported.
The pictures from there remind of a war zone.
On Friday night, several tornadoes caused severe damage in the USA and possibly claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms left a 320-kilometer-long trail of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area that everything was gone everywhere the tornado had ravaged.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible at all.
He estimates that up to a hundred people have died in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official figures are rising constantly.
Hello, I just saw that Vitrine #NAME# is sold out.
That is very bad.
Is it still produced?

Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
When do you report?
If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany?
I had sent back an article via the contact form or returned it and wanted to inquire whether it arrived or was processed, as I had not yet received any confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination fees and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into calls for vaccination - according to the German model - should also increase the willingness to be vaccinated.
He has changed companies over which he has grumbled.
That does not make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
After all, he did not stay in his old position and looked for something else.
You can also do that.
And that he didn't like you back then: naja egal.
He did not like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.

Help with first own campaign
Goodbye Boron!
I am currently leading an adventure over the Greifenpass for a group of 4 friends and want to seamlessly integrate my heroes into a campaign specially written for players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are conceived, and now I'm writing the opening adventure and stumbling over my own feet in the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to transport a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran lake.
The further action will take place there.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to ambush the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: persuade, act, threaten, recognize danger early on, whatever comes to the players.
Group size: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords
If the hero doesn't notice, the goblins lurk in a hollow way and flank the carriage to the left and right with bows, while two with spears stop the carriage.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes all fall unconscious and are subsequently found and healed by the village schoolmaster's son, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
2. If a defeat is inevitable, this half-elf and two of his knights come to the hero's aid in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate is your Deus ex Machina from solution 2?
Is the encounter as an entry into the adventure too much?
The group of goblins will later play a decisive role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I had not expected so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely embrace many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And again together.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That is why I would like to send them back
If you don't mind, I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I am tired of Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality on German Sky has deteriorated more and more, so I want to take a little air with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the schedule was far behind the plan due to the delayed start and the start accident, the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision could still have been shown.
It seems, however, that for legal reasons F1 has priority and therefore everything else must be restricted, so that Sky DE here had no choice.
Nevertheless, stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: Commentator Olivier Zwartyes did a good job covering the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then, in Formula 1, the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher showed a lack of knowledge of the rules, as both did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change the tires when there were appropriate radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen.
I think you should just know these basic rules if you are commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first puzzle that is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both have constant uncertainty about the rules.
Generally, the artificial commentary style of Roos is not liked, but it has to be admitted that it is a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko Wasser from RTL.
This is accompanied by constant tomfoolery, which makes both of them simply seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee with (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or Ralf Schumacher's "UuuuuHD".
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the final round Sky is the only broadcaster that advertises, as one can hear on F1TV, where only the German audio track without commentary is available directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF does that.
These two channels also make less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
I have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that broadcasts the F1.
Seriously, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
So the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# pendulum light, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email and she has never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the material has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Air pumps are ideal for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system with air lifters.
This series is offered in three versions by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
You can compare the services there.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect more outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. But if you want to add an accent to your aquarium, for example with an air curtain (find it in our shop), or with decoration that turns the air bubbles into a function.
Here a treasure chest, mussel or similar could be mentioned.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet with a 4/6 mm air hose...and it's ready to go.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and mounted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent water from flowing backwards through the pump and out of the basin...
If the fan is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify a processing time of 3 days for eBay, the parcels are packed daily and picked up daily.
If everything goes well on the road, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent anyone from being upset because it took a little longer this time.
It's like that, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics sector... of course, here no one is stopping Corona.
Please don't rate us poorly just because delivery is delayed, that is exclusively the fault of the shipping services.
Of course, people love to complain about these services, even though we are saying at the moment... they have it very difficult
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Is it also possible to order the legs in white?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first US American in space, a TV moderator and four other passengers have made a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a radiant blue sky, Bezos personally received the freshly cut astronauts after their return.
Welcome back, Bezos said, dressed in a blue space suit, when he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, the flight lasted ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard, after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company; the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
She just went along with it, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed himself enthusiastically.
He would like to return to space again, the moderator said.
New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometers high
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automatically.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the earth, sometimes with weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the earth to be the boundary of space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned spaceflight: At the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board together with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second event in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
With one click, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently glow in one color or its entire color spectrum.
When the color is changed, the luminescent stone keeps its light color for about a minute before gently changing to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lighting remains intact all year round.
In snowy surroundings, its light is particularly good – it is only to be expected that its light duration will decrease as the days get shorter.
In winter, please make sure that no snow obstructs the solar module in its function.
The "Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the standard Mignon (AA) format, which can easily be replaced if necessary.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and I find the subject itself quite exciting and I am not disturbed by the lab either (I have already done the inorganic chemistry practical).
Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before the study, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely study until the doctorate and will.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially about my career prospects.
On the one hand (StudyCheck etc.), one always hears about super career opportunities and the profession is totally in demand, on the other hand, one always hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/What training did you do?
4) Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really unsure and am considering stopping my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as a specialist in informatics.
If you have any experience, please write about it.
Extra stress before holidays and holiday weekends
This topic came up last week with me.
I had to use my long weekend now to relax.
That's why it's only now getting a post.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is big stress in our company.
As it seems, there are also before holidays and bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which we call "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is semi-official.
There was a long four-day weekend last week.
What happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
According to numerous e-mails that had to be sent immediately before departure, order here order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because "next week then" sounds too long after so much time?
Or because people want to do so much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also very annoyed.
What is this self-restraint for holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very independent.
My question is simply: Are we the only ones, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but doesn't have any presents yet.
Even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you just go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She would agree to the festival by baking a cake with her son.
I love it, said Catterfeld.
She still has some things to do until the calm days: "For the first time I don't have any presents, I have to get started now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moult and feather renewal.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of feather damage in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the feathers consist of protein-containing substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather coat.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to inadequate or imbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
While using NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft feed.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still does not work
DDR Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968. Used with play tracks and missing parts, see photos, function good, The E95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the German Federal Railways (DRG), which was conceived for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the construction kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we have made it operational
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to make proposals for an electric locomotive that could haul 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this line.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined that AEG would deliver the mechanical part and Siemens-Schuckertwerke the electrical part as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with cardan drive.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01 to 06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were delivered to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany in November 1952.
All six locomotives were deemed to be worthy of repair at the Dessau Railway Repair Works.
In 1959, as the progressive electrification of the central German network led to an increasing need for locomotives for heavy freight train services, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were rebuilt, using the other machines as donors for spare parts.
First of all, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 locomotives that were available in large numbers were built up.
It was only when it became clear that the E 94 could not be further upgraded that the E 95 came into view for upgrading.
First, the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They came to the Halle P depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal to Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
As a result, it often happened that the shooter stuck during switching operations.
Then the fireman, who was constantly travelling on this locomotive, had to use a hammer and wooden wedge to unlatch the shield during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred more often and led to months of downtime for the locomotive.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new build locomotives available and an obvious expansion of the electrical service was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most of the fragment categories, so that the E 95 was taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one man, which would have been a problem for train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and visibility from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service in the middle of 1969, the E 95 01 followed as the last, leaving service on October 5, 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a track heating system at the main station Halle.
It took some time for those responsible at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external processing of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
The locomotive is cared for in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational processing of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external paintwork, while the transformers were checked and five traction motors were operational.
The locomotives were used on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the central German network.
The main area of deployment was initially Silesia
Handwork model H0 in OVP, function good, there are optical post-processing on the locomotive in own work, smoked, with playing tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition - possibly the building kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F parts are
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet...unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I cannot build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The middle beam does not fit into the planned holder.
So I get new ones.
When will they be sent?
No, not flat.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the right ones from the form, they were only too narrow
But that does not matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
They are not flat with me
Could I receive this?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in an apartment in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (district of Landsberg am Lech).
According to the information, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume a deliberate act of arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But that comes much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To combat fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously spoken publicly about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
The illness of a friend had moved him to share, Şahin said.
Uğur Şahin, CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, has published a photo showing how he is being vaccinated against the coronavirus.
On social media, there were false reports that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network.
For a few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counter these false rumors.
Until now, he has rejected this, because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to hear that one of my old school friends is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often stoked by false information and mistrust.
Fear is difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
It is currently not allowed for me to get the vaccine myself, Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization of vaccination in Germany.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has long been lifted - and the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times, according to his own information.
Fire in Umspannanlage: Ten thousand people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no power and in many cases also no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a transformer station.
After a fire with severe damage to a transformer station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities due to the fire.
Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators were in use on Saturday until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely remedied late at night.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the primary technology department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz technicians were initially only able to put some cables back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Current flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at around 7.15pm has caused severe damage to parts of the 10,000-volt switching system in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There, extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply has been restored.
Since Saturday 18:00, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected at 9:30 p.m.
Since 11.15 p.m. those affected by the outage have had electricity again.
More than 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
After building an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for help from neighbors.
It is important now that citizens look after their elderly or single neighbours and let the local fire departments know if help is needed, explained district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the main focus was on residents of retirement homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those people who cannot take care of themselves or who depend on electricity-dependent medical devices or medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the daily cover #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day and stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount it on the tabletop.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions.
We wanted those with tabletop diameters of #NUMBER#
We got 155 cm diameter.
Today, my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't stack them and thus shorten them.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
I would be happy to receive feedback
Yes, that is really easier!
Then we do it!
Can you send me the return receipt by mail?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the e-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low rebate almost insulting.
We do not agree with that
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined skiers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the world cup in the Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to give way again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had started the cross-country skiing with a large lead after the ski jump.
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both made it new and use version 4.5...
It could be that they have heard about the problem more often
I bought a book directly with my # PRS_ORG #.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes, ups!
This document could not be opened.
If the file is possibly defective, they can report it to the customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me further?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I also have to work in between!
So that the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the building materials with a little soap and water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you bring the brush with a new color to the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do that on the inside of the parts, which you can no longer see, or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the part
Pull the brush stroke by stroke.
Light overlap of the color layers ensures a uniform surface later.
Avoid quickly wiping with the brush.
This results in unrealistic-looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Begin with the bright colors.
The dark could otherwise shine later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors are completed with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to ugly metal strips when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you assemble them.
The models have an authentic appearance thanks to the decals or stickers.
From national emblems on aircraft to ship names and decorative strips and number plates on model cars: The decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the right order while the parts are still accessible.
A plane cockpit can be easily coated before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are the time, patience and a calm hand when gluing.
Cut each required decal individually and arrange them.
Decals are also called water slide images because you briefly moisten their reverse side with water until the carrier paper turns dark through the moisture.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit off the paper and put the piece in the right place on the model (which you also wet beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper sideways.
Warning: Always check first whether the picture is sitting correctly before you push it completely off the paper so that it doesn't stick to your fingers, knit or even tear.
Excess water with a budget towel.
Warning not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time if I look at something else, then I don't read the book anymore and have to log out and log in and reload the book and find the place where I left off.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get this by email?
For all three packages?
Because the lamp came to me in three separate packages
Thank you anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Will I get it back easily?
Treatment for infertility with private health insurance / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We had been undergoing fertility treatment for some time, and now, when it comes to billing the health insurance company, they are suddenly balking.
One after the other:
We had applied for the fertility treatment with the PKV in advance and were given the go-ahead for three attempts.
The experiments were in no way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.) restricted.
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was reimbursed by the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet deduct this from the PKV.
We again applied for the costs to be taken over by the PKV and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we carried out more trials than agreed, logically the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 trials (2 + 3) the PKV only wants to refund 3 trials.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the other two attempts of the first promise are forfeited.
The second child is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, however, "The insurance case begins with the healing treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or we (5 attempts have to be made)?
Did the PKV have to tell us that with a birth the further attempts would be cancelled?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here gave their opinion.
Many thanks for your help already!
Could you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again
Okay.
We will no longer order anything from them.
If they add my turnover and that of my friend #NAME# (same address) they have obviously lost good customers.
They are welcome to forward it to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund was triggered and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't do anything about the fact that the wardrobe arrives completely destroyed at my place
Please see what the colleague has written in the screenshot
It is clear and obvious that the repayment was caused and I have still not received a repayment via #PRS_ORG#
They can inform their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they may not sell it as an office chair.
In any case, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cupboard and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional hoppers that can be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them for you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
What exactly a low-budget film is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little or no funding from major film studios or private investors.
There are plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about it?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours and have already completely furnished two apartments with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now reliable?
Many thanks
With friendly greetings
If there is no telephone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I give up soon again, because it simply does not work here.
Hello
Halber Sieg" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus's border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU had not solved the confrontation in a sustainable way, the researcher of the Berlin foundation Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) explained.
This state of limbo - Belarus doesn't give an inch, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably go on for a while.
The treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Apparently, there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided against it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion in the Union at the same time.
It seems that she cannot assert herself if a member state insists on doing its own thing, as is currently the case with Poland, which is not even allowing the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy on the border with Belarus, says Bossong: An agreement on the basic principles of asylum policy will be made more difficult, since the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
New attempt to cross the border
According to Poland's border protection, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested and taken back to the border on Sunday night, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were attacked with stones by the migrants near the place Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border protection registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or tried to do so.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of being the ruler in Minsk and having lured it with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU's reaction is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
′′ The EU has thrown its market power into the scales and proved its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions ".
Minsk must also consider domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not used to the security apparatus regularly locking down thousands of people in the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule violations during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has appealed.
The silver arrows suspected two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he allegedly overtook illegally.
A second appeal was filed against the verdict at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed correctly.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and was celebrating his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken the car in front of him.
I check that.
I speak with the bank and register again with you
thank you for the support
Free entry for members: Europa-Park organises SC Freiburg Fantag
The Europa Park, namesake for the Europa Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announced, members and annual card holders of the sports club from Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains shone red and white on this day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," the park said.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa Park, it was once again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing glowing fans having fun on the roller coaster confirms this, says Europa Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not as originally 1699€?

As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note and also served as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the night sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form to return an article yesterday, but did not receive any email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request has been accepted.
Not everyone has the time for your incompetent chat and cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you correct and not all from our budget.
Contact Frau #NAME#.
I cannot chat with them every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a renewed order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.

Sorry, but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite does not mean anything.
That is like when an AfD politician says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just leave it completely.
Wow, then you're as unserious as Kollegah.
Anyone who fundamentally questions evolution is simply lost.
For my part, a God has set the whole thing in motion.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
In order to maintain an optimal field of view, the loupe should be as close as possible to the eye.
The specifically planar-achromatic lens system allows you to use the loupe practically free of registration and color errors even in the edge zone.
Frequently, lenses are marked with magnification information.
However, these specifications only apply to exactly defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to use your magnifier optimally, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical data" (See user manual in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including impact lenses.
By applying an antireflex coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
Under ideal conditions of use - the loupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the attached user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: Women in Krembz are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations when selling trees.
Once a man even drove home without his partner because they could not agree.
Every year he plants around 2000.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
That makes the pre-Christmas time a bit funny, he says.
And with the voucher?
Otherwise, I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now have to pay the full price.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher," which doesn't sound nearly as appetizing.
Problems with glass fibre + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fibre optic connection in the house for a couple of weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable WiFi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which reliably received and sent 50 Mbit, with the exception of a few outages.
The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module connected to the FritzBox.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the WiFi, no longer receives the full 500, but the further I get away from the module with the module, the less comes in (i.e. use a power outlet that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new glass fiber connection is now even slower in the first floor (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similar losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is "lost" over the power line with glass fibre?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I have created an account here.
Therefore, I would be all the more pleased about an answer.
When it is time to change the current account
Those who thought that now there would be peace with the Giro accounts were mistaken.
While many banks used the autumn to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the free allowances for negative interest rates are also falling.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the allowance and even quadrupled the daily rate.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the corporate division Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current accounts and investment accounts, and to 25,000 euros for day-to-day accounts.
However, these lower fees now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already previously fallen to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
Nevertheless: More than 100 banks now have a free allowance of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court even won against this regulation.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly form reserves—in the event that the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a mountain and valley.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made headlines in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An army of assistants, stylists and trainers is dedicated to keeping them looking their best.
Nevertheless, so Aniston, she allows herself a chip a day (yes, rightly read: a single chip from the bag).
It is a wonder that their hearts have fallen for both female and male fans alike.
Perhaps because she simply has bad luck with luck - and is still looking for the great love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to hope that success and fame also make people happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight band touch, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the motorsport royal class.
To say goodbye, his wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the world championship in 2007 in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bob - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
I've calculated it once, I'd have to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026, said the double Olympic champion from the BSC Oberbärenburg, who celebrated two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he fended off the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, moving from third to first.
Then he changed something in the material setup and drove a larger lead out on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team, Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bau (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) beat the Brit Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded, said Friedrich, who also recorded his 22nd win in a row.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who was driving for Stuttgart, came fifth this time after second place in the previous race.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after ranking fourth in the first race.
If I knew what he did differently, I would do it too, said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
At home, Laura Nolte won the third victory of the season in the two-woman bob.
After only managing fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to the world cup win on Sunday with her starter Deborah Levi.
Two-man Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded her first podium finish this winter.
Wiesbadenerin Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
It was super cool for me to get the first podium in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is joining me.
I am very happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and stressed: "It's not just about pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the ceiling in my shopping cart and could buy it now!
What should I do?
I did not receive it and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally inquired.
Last year, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he was expired, which made me very angry.
Looking at the chat, it was about the Asare seat.
I want to return it and then order it again, since it is currently reduced.
Why is shipping starting on 16.3.?
There was nothing on your website about such long delivery times
No, only when I click on it comes an extra field with the message
Was gestern von Ihrer Kollegin abgenommen wurde.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello beautiful girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe it's the same for one or the other...
I'm 24, I have a part-time job, I'm a full-time student and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't cry or go to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (we've been together since 6th grade) is sick, got a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because his hand was in a cast due to burns).
He is also aloof and we see each other less (1-2 times a week) which makes it very difficult for me to meet my needs for affection and love.
My dog has just had a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and stroking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we also have household chores to do, which we of course share.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My post-traumatic stress disorder is currently doing very well, I'm halfway through therapy and doing well.
Not good, but I get by and am almost symptom-free.
My university demands a lot from me right now (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I have not done anything and the day after tomorrow anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little.
And next week I've got an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no space left.
So my week goes: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental anchors, because otherwise I'd go nuts.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it any other way...
Is it the same for you?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I do not have to work.
Really unbelievably grateful, I can't put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived otherwise.
I think that has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I'd find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you a relaxing evening anyway, the week is almost over!
Unfortunately, I received my order today, but the color is completely different and the surface is scratched and the table leg has imprints.
The color of the first delivery was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or what?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.
In any case, twice.
But it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: At school, I realized that many religion teachers did not believe in God and that it was just another subject for them, like math or geography.
For me, it was always something strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed.
How do you feel about it?
Perhaps you can also tell from colleagues at work or study with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional, and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes someone want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Culture or something else?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not? Write English, I also understand it well
It's been a long time, then I would stop
It is good, thank you.
I expect a response within the next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Filmsuche Hilfe bitte
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a film from my childhood (24).
I believe it was a film for young people.
In the film there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite certain).
Since I can't describe it any closer in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live himself, I think.
I think the transition is also the grave of the soldier.
In the end, both soldiers fight against each other.
If this says something to you, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has only slept on her belly from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive:D
Relax.
So a child holds much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything around it works, no cuddly toys, go in more often and look, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and we never had a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Observe your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it stand up from the belly?
Or is it with the face?
You can deduce from that whether everything is in order.
We have also all grown up and when my husband came into the world, it was all gang and give, that you put the kids on the belly to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought many articles
But why do you only offer me 20 euros?
Hello, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no reply.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#)
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently not usable.
To put it quite clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply the case that the politics of this broadcaster are now under all sorts of pressure.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then immediately go on a big begging tour.
It was said that one was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: "You don't want to be a walking billboard."
What are you now?
A 0815 advertiser who is trying to get his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, this applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and is trying to make a profit from the action with the rented rooms that have exploded.
How do you find all this good?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I ask for a return, as my delivered wooden table is defective.
Corpus breakdown due to damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or simply for cuddling, my little warm friend is versatile.
Rowan berry pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing warmth applications, as rowan berries absorb and release heat very well.
The removable inner cushion can be easily warmed up in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft fabric makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if it's not going so well.
The cherry kernel pillow with cover is only suitable as a heat pad for the following applications:
Before warming up the kiss on atypical smell, stock or burn spots and immediately dispose of it if present.
Please take the inner cushion out of the cover before heating it!
In the microwave with a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Directly after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the cushion by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first heating, a slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, which disappears with repeated applications.
Please adhere to the given heating instructions, as longer periods or higher energy performance can lead to damage (ignition and combustion danger!).
Check before heating in the microwave that heating grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the warmed inner cushion has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion on your wrist (max. 43 °C) for babies!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory complaints, fresh hematoma, bleeding and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain perception.
In the case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases, as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels have escaped, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and inaccessibly for children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year, the temperature of the child should be regularly monitored during the application to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The reference is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt is second after the Hinserie - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
Ingolstadt is also not running under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hanover about interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20Q and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago and it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone is enough to operate.
Wrong display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the plugged-in power supply.
I then dismantled the battery, but that didn't help either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in online mode?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design no problem!
The 20-litre capacity means that even larger photo equipment can be swallowed without any problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need in everyday objects remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design is iconic - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to photo equipment.
This works with two options: conventionally via the cover flap, which can be locked with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already been proven with the Messenger Bags.
In the locking mechanism there is a metal locking hook on the front side of the backpack.
Unlike most rucksacks, Peak Design has thought of various "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be fastened.
If the rucksack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Flaps and hooks are also magnetic.
This means that the rucksack can be reliably closed without the hook.
The second possibility also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the flap closure, there is also a tear-off opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to wade through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday practicality of the rucksack enormously: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior to your liking (more on that below) and store both items separately and easily access them through the two side openings.
For example, you can pull the backpack from the right side to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items stay safely in the left backpack half and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the rucksack is also made from 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents stay dry even if it's going to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the appointment of
Contact with the shipping company to pick up the wrongly delivered table announced.
So far, I have not received any news.
I ask for immediate processing.
I am now writing to the third support employee, with none of them I got further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
It is the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
When could the cupboard be delivered again?
It is not an option for me to keep him...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
Have a nice evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will immediately place a larger order, but after all, I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not returned it.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected, I could not suspect and have not been able to clarify in time.
But the damage I have as a customer and I do not accept it.

On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is aimed at removing the disc according to the properties of the original installation.
The tinted glass produced in this way ensures high comfort and brake efficiency.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the notches improve the cleaning of brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tinted glass underline the character of every car through attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing fragments in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels arose almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who is looking for wealth in the West and wants to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your pioneer colleagues so as not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your board allow you to be more efficient, gain additional actions, or bend the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), to 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can carry out actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a barrier!
This deactivates half of the site - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns carrying out actions such as gaining resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores and positioning revolver heroes.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The announcer turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and changes the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, i.e. once hidden each location and the year ends.
There is a shootout where the players have to defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive smaller rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score is determined.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it immediately.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008) he triggered a fierce debate about education.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is difficult to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
It should never, never, never be about power over the child for our parents and other caregivers.
Our goal must always be to give the child room to develop and to make the framework for the child as large as possible in the situation.
Brrr, I still shiver.
Holetschek: Countries are discussing the abolition of the mandatory test for threefold vaccinated
The health ministers of the states want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide abolition of the obligation to undergo a test for those who have been vaccinated three times.
We need clarity quickly from the countries, as to whether and from when the testing obligation no longer applies to those who have been vaccinated three times, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the health ministers' conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The loss of 2G plus for threefold vaccination is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional vaccination boost," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed that "he will already make a proposal to the health ministers' conference next Tuesday." - afp
So I want to send the lamp back
How do I do that best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I can't see how high the seat surface is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer process any purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Anzeige: Ups, ein Fehler ist aufgetreten.
Shopping over the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated my data.
What is the reason for this?
What you describe is called *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under full anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
It is most common to hear noises/voices, less common to see pictures and even rarer to feel pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned in the anesthesia interview.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex by definition had none.
Misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros do not help either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation and standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an email that you did not answer.
The question again.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipping company is #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told they would only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I have to cancel the order, as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture upstairs.
will I not be called?
I had asked a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has profiled himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental theater history.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
The new book is still lying on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older."
The disturbing diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby express my gratitude for my life."
There are various types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used as load carriers in the European region.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not recorded

Rouladen Tipps & Tricks
I had many great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
There was one at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and creamy!
So thank you again!
Now I've got a taste for it and want to cook rouladen for New Year's Eve for the first time.
Tomorrow I will set up a beef fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
What happens now?
What about the books? How do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I get by
IEs is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by mail on January 18 that the refund had taken place.
But until today, the money has not come to me.
Could you please check that?
Where there are still Christmas roasts in Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts.
Did you not get any wings?
Now the time is short.
We tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube output stage plays a major role in the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-Regler you can set the desired level and the distortion of your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL regulator that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything in the "gain" and distortion.
Further up, it had already been announced that the POWER LEVEL regulator can even be used to call up a performance reserve if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so that even when using headphones or recording directly, you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression.
You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX input, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
There is also a tuner on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
Anyone who additionally purchases a VFS5 footswitch can also easily call up the sounds with their feet, turn the effect blocks on and off, and change the tempo of the compatible effects "tapping".
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But others saw it differently.
Is it then possible to send the lamp back?
Because it is too low over the table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me further?
And the wardrobe?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it does not work, I would also be satisfied with a legacy or voucher.
Perhaps I will find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need is a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were part of the delivery.
I would like to install the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) at the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worth it
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
According to Iran, progress is being made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
Both sides are about to agree on the topics that are on the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development," because at the beginning there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were continued after almost a week of interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia are participating in the talks.
A US delegation is also in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen overtakes Saxony - Freistaat now federal state with highest Corona incidence
Thüringen has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thüringen exceeded the mark of 1000 on Sunday in terms of Corona incidence.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thüringen had fallen slightly, but had also exceeded the value of 1000.
In Thüringen, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths in connection with an infection were reported on the same day.
200 seriously ill Covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there can be delays in registration.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and are barely keeping up with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since delivery only takes place at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and take it to the post office, right?
Do I have to do anything else here?
That is precisely what I want to avoid, which is why I write to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euros for return shipping is an outrage in my eyes.
It is time for changes
Dear members of the Bundestag, I greet you. I am in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why the post here?
If you take a look at the activity of the Bundestag in recent months, you can see that it is not extensive.
We are in a winter standstill and have extended the summer hole for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what happened?
For the most part, this is simply due to dissatisfaction, how some things have turned out and how we stand in general.
In recent days, it has become increasingly clear that many people here still want to go to the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is asked what it wants to keep alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has recently become aware of this project and found, simply put, a pile of shards.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have been found who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would like to call on everyone once again to participate, only then can this project also exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which we can exchange ourselves and work out concrete things.
You can enter the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the Bundestag function in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we act in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair election system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot some things, but that's not so bad, we have the Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to Discord, work with us, and let's decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade for you, which is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered another hanging for you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, since the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: Is the daily cover #PRS_ORG also available in larger sizes, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty wardrobe will be picked up promptly.
And I beg you to do so now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will dismantle the cupboard as far as possible for collection - they have to clarify with # PRS_ORG # how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there an instruction for the installation?
How long would I have time to get these and decide whether to send them back?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I really like.
She herself lived vegetarian for a while, eats meat very rarely now.
I myself was a vegetarian for several years.
When asked whether I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would be supporting animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that she was irritated on her side, she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that vegetarians reduced animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "flat"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without wanting to do so.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is not an exception under section 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be able to pick up my return on the assigned date at #PRS_ORG#.
Since I can't be there for a funeral, that unfortunately can't be changed.
Could you please assign me an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for water rescue equipped: 45,000 euro subsidy from the state
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz presented a donation certificate in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the voluntary fire brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte in the town hall of Lahnstein.
The total costs of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatine is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatine.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they are permanently expecting increasing demand: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I cannot open the book.
I followed their recommendations, synchronized, removed and reloaded the app NICHTS has worked.
I am a little frustrated because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, then.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you for standing up for the whole thing, I've also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, so we were also armed guards in the executive, I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, one should say that the civil servant usually comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, it should also be clear to everyone that people who are attracted to the right, and wear a uniform and carry weapons, will have difficulty dealing with reality. Of course, it is also clear that, alongside the average white, there are now many Germans of migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and when I say homosexuals, I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine stereotypes, because there are fewer of those in the executive, but normal men and women, and I can rely on them, because in doubt they will save your life or put theirs in for you.
But these fringe groups also represent, in my experience, a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel that they are rather less disadvantaged by exaggerated left-wing policies, even if these policies are supposedly for their benefit or supposedly doing them justice, they just want to be treated normally.
Back to civil rights, of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, and you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but the fact that they are allowed to say their opinion openly, or even formulate any subversive plans, is totally exaggerated and also annoys me.
Of course, it also happens that police officers and soldiers, who were often deployed abroad, often start to generalize and say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that like-minded people meet who carry out a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, such a thing is well combated and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so intertwined internationally and that is a good thing in my opinion, that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that the other basket was also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I have previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black could be delivered to Germany or this basket is available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
but on the edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves, which are filled with something yellow
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself
Ordinary through child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed and have little free time), but for as long as I can remember, I have struggled to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything stays the same, and then and then I get up and clean up.
But it is actually never so "that someone could visit spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly the budget just loses against work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become decent with children?
We do not have one yet, but we are working on it and this question has been occupying me for a long time.
Because for me there is no incentive, I simply don't like it so much, as long as no visitors come and, for example, always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen is usable.
Does having children give you more motivation or do you stay lazy?
Looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and qualitatively high-quality and anatomically shaped cut, offers a maximum in comfort, a perfect fit and thus almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, further molding at the joints for improved mobility (arm and knee bends)

Career in social work - as someone with a personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in the field of software development and have been working for about a year.
Unfortunately, I notice more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-doubting (or fear-avoiding) personality disorder (AVPS).
This means, roughly speaking, that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I don't have a problem talking to people on a factual level, but it's very hard for me to have casual conversations and I've been told many times that I come across as unapproachable (which I think I've gotten better at).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth club, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family assistance.
I don't know if the concrete working day is really as I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing me problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because every time there is something to criticize in my code ("once again, the simplest things are screwed up"), and it is difficult for me to ask experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how it works by now" / "I'm keeping him from his work with my stupid questions" / "he must think I'm stupid" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession, but I wanted to mention it here.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was also no confirmation.
I am waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean by giving back?
If I download a book to the # PRS_ORG #, the message comes I # PRS_ORG # does not authorize this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein in the food is broken down in the bird's gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and the bird uses these to build its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in nestlings and the formation of new feathers in maturing birds are extremely complex processes and are particularly demanding for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as this can lead to disruptions in the breeding process.
Following this brief gift of NECTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NECTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NECTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A scratched measuring spoon (inlay) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the onset of feather regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until the feather renewal is completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break down after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community worker in contradiction to the constitution
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So Fällantrag an die Gemeinde gestellt.
An employee writes to me that cutting down fruit trees and thus the walnut is not part of the statute.
However, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree in the statute.
Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a severe traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-North junction and Plößberg.
As the police press release currently reports (14:03), a passenger car came into the opposite lane while overtaking.
There are injured.
Okay, I understand.
Great, then many thanks again that it went so easily!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
Happy Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is only moderately good, because my dear head is currently thinking about everything that can be thought about.
Before I digress here... in short: I need advice and preferably from people who know my situation - so from you.
I'm doing the ref as a rookie.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in a field there (to at least remain anonymous, I do not mention anything more specific).
The whole thing was then too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I landed in teaching and was sure that was what I wanted - even if the conditions were much more rigid than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I am now at the third "I Google other job postings."
And it's only been half a year.
Before the paintings, I always decided to continue and at least finish the referee. Afterwards, I can always turn around.
But I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely drained.
Now it is the holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the referee, I always thought I was stress resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my evening my evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in the moments.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that make me nervous.
In principle, it's fun and viewed from the outside, the ref is also going well, which is good for the feedback and so on.
But I am completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it hasn't already.
I wonder whether I want to have that for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions - or whether I should go back to the old area, where I was valued, I could take time when I needed it, and although the work was somehow boring, it was adequately paid and we worked together in a team to achieve something.
But then I ask myself if I will not be in the same place again in a year and dissatisfied.
You realize that it is all somehow confusing, but maybe you as an outsider have advice or ideas how I can get out of this situation that I am completely finished and start crying at the smallest thought.
I'm not going to make any decisions now; that would probably lead to nothing good.
But perhaps your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation is at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has been consistently further developed, which has led to the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly simulates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X / VT40X / VT100X amps, we are presenting a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analogue circuits, because these get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier much better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit design, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances just bubble.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, until the Amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Needless to say, it has since been refined numerous times to satisfy new sound demands, which led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists in search of maximum sound diversity will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the output stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier, and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuitry of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, is perfect in recreating the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but victory over the Los Angeles Clippers is not enough.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro closure parts, it adapts to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from compact system cameras of all sizes to full-format SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible equipment could be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three changeable lenses and an external flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can also store a lot of accessories.
And anyone with a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for photo-unrelated things.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also the perfect choice for drone pilots, as it provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is now the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists dared not make any predictions about when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Damages in millions
In the almost three months since the start of the eruption, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Nearly 1,200 hectares were covered by a one-meter-thick lava layer.
That is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new land masses with a total area of around 50 hectares have emerged off the coast due to cooled lava.
The banana plantations, which are of immense importance for the island and on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, were hit particularly hard. The plantations were already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is approaching and the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gestures of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-promoting "social contract of primitive peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became Christkind
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days with gift giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, threw three bags of gold through the window of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving gifts led to the popular German custom of filling children's boots with presents.
Protestants object to this custom because they reject the idea of intermediaries between God and man as "saint worship."
For these reasons, they are opposed to the institution.
Martin Luther turned Nikolaus into the Christkind and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of the gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants do not see such detailed questions so closely any more, it only annoys a few that the custom of St. Nicholas is still a firm part of the pre-Christmas period like the Martin's custom with Martin's singing and Martin's procession.
Today one can find boots on the doorstep and under the Christmas tree filled with everything the heart desires, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was moved to Christmas.
However, in all Christian countries, there is a joyful muddle over the question of who will now bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ child appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who is essentially a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been attributed over time.
For example, his white ruffled beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who brought fame.
Here it is not cattle, but three horses that pull his sleigh.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite wars, the Christ child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.

Police shoot alleged bank robbers near the royal palace
A man armed with a knife was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who had entered a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was stopped by officers a short time later.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
What then?

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into every bed, garden area or rock garden.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in batteries.
Light duration max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic version is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally.
In contrast, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light glows fascinatingly – optionally in white or coloured light (in six different colour tones).
The seamless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic rounded shapes fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the company of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can hold his own thanks to his size.
Large preparations can be saved: As a solar lamp, "Smart Stone" does not need a connection or batteries.
Put the "luminance stone" on any sunlit place.
Two supplied earth spikes provide a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module conceals "Smart Stone" discreetly in its interior, together with his battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
As dusk falls, the "Smart Stone" begins to glow on its own; in which color, you decide: Six attractive light colors are available to you - in addition to daylight white.
And the shutdown ultimately occurs automatically once the battery charging level drops to a predetermined minimum or it gets light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the loading cycle starts the next day from the beginning.
I've done that several times and it didn't work.
Shame, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not taken into account, I will not order again in principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
In the lockdown, no garden center has opened...
The locomotive control of the LokSound 5 was again fundamentally improved.
A variably adjustable PWM frequency of 10 kHz to 50 kHz ensures super-quiet operation in the case of bell crank motors in particular – the typical "buzzing" belongs to the past.
The load regulation can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows the automatic adjustment of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder provides enough power for older motors with up to 1.5A motor current.

Pillenproblem
Hello dear women,
I hope I'm doing this right, it's actually my first post on reddit after a year.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and shitty PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it at that, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last break of about two years, from 0 to 100, I got explosive pimples everywhere.
So superficially, but this has really stressed me and I did not feel well.
During the two-year break, things never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without noise, but maybe someone can recommend something to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist did not take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the skin is such a thing.
Had terrible neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale acne and the acne topic.
I have also tried everything possible in terms of nutrition in the course of Christian illness and have remained on a sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed diet, because otherwise nothing really worked.
It can also be good that the worm is simply hormonal, but if you have building sites everywhere like I do, you just want to stop looking for what else is wrong.
I had already told her colleague everything.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concern.
I had to work in between and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check when the money is there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong

110 kV underground cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is final.
The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision paves the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann transformer station in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.

Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in the referee's room since the summer, teaching is fun for me, but at the moment I still have big problems planning my geography lessons efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so I can basically only use the whiteboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors and with me, every hour stands for itself.
In principle, the methods are repeated again and again, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I also need it for UBs, etc.).
I always start planning from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore also the work sheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
That would really make me happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at # PRS_ORG #, but I would like to return the return as soon as possible.
The trade fears the 2G regulation for Christmas business.
Only those who are vaccinated or recovered may enter most businesses.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains about sales slumps.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations are harmful to retail from the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE).
In business with articles of non-daily need, there are complaints about sales slumps, criticized HDE managing director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is often now a hole without a bottom, said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things are only going well in food retail and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The shopping with masks, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
2G when shopping does not take us any further in the fight against the pandemic, he stressed.
The current regulations scared customers away and required high personnel expenditure.
The bandwidth regulation must be allowed nationwide, he demanded.
After that, every customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all businesses with the received band on that day.
In addition, in retail - as in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - sample checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company specializing in shopping centers, Deutsche Euroshop, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the turnover at around 90 percent.
These figures will certainly fall in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, where "visitors, for example, once prove their 2G at a central location in the center and then - equipped with an armband similar to a club hotel - can enter all businesses without being disturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The Spiegel has a scratch and there is also a mistake in the frame that was attempted to be covered with a yellow filler.
That looks bad.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already put it back in the package and glued it.
How do I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
For the setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities is used.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650 K and save it.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to use.
The lamp generates a very high light flow with soft light of high quality, completely free of flicker.
The 120-degree beam angle, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
Incidentally, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
They can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work with both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in difficult to access places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in delivery)
User storage The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the settings of the individual settings on the storage places, it is simply done by longer pressing one of the storage buttons and finished.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - Very practical in the studio when, for example, the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 Functionality is derived from the possibility of operating with low-cost NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before setting off whether the batteries have enough power – it has a built-in battery tester – for each of the two battery compartments there is a value in the two display units (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlights with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm hose for fixing, so you can connect it directly to your photo stand.
The inclination can be reliably set with a stop on both sides.
It was taken into account that the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a steering gear is included in the delivery.
It is also great that a bag is included in the delivery.
This way you can safely transport or store the light with all the accessories you may want to buy.
Shame, I got it as a gift and it is too small :(
′′ Party we wanted to throw ": Frankfurt celebrates after a torrid comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had lost twice in a row, were apparently on the way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then SGE turned it around, shot themselves free of their frustration over a mixed start to the season in under an hour and won furiously with 5-2. "It's crazy what the boys have achieved today," trainer Oliver Glasner shouted for DAZN and spoke of "general praise for everyone who was involved."
This initially looked like another setback for Frankfurt, who are still ninth in the league despite not meeting expectations.
Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen a 2-0 lead.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
As the players came back and showed a fantastic performance, Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we showed and of course also with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was back on the pitch for the first time since the fourth game day and his overcome muscle injury, also stressed the morale of his teammates.
I think our mentality is incredible, said the 27-year-old and enjoyed the result, especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also sees himself well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It is exceptional that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in a top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live professionally.
Now one wants to "go step by step further and stay humble" and complete the tasks by the end of the year "at this level".
Next Wednesday, as part of the English week, there is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6.30 p.m., Sky).
I get the mail that my package is coming back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and redirect it, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and the order is cancelled again?
Unfortunately, this would mean for me that I will not order it again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for handball women before quarter-final against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slunk off the court after their defeat to Denmark, heads bowed and empty-eyed.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection suffered a bitter defeat at 16-32 (8-13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face hosts Spain in the quarter finals.
We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent, said national coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It is a shame that we could not take the flow.
That was a bad game that we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle for a place in the semi-finals, a clear improvement must be made against the World Cup runner-up in 2019 next Tuesday in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
We were simply not there—neither in attack nor in defense, admitted Xenia Smits, the back player, and demanded: "We must now look to the future."
From front to back not on the level
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on the level at the start.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and holes in the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counterattack.
However, the hoped-for initial ignition was not this.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly get into play - and if so, they usually failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
Thus, the game was over at 3-10 after 20 minutes, especially since back player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, however, she may participate again.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB selection played somewhat better and at least five goals before the break.
Anyway, any faint hope of catching up after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9-19.
The Greens once again sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal candidates at the finals.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to rally for a performance boost and went down as a clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions at Christmas
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have won the day of St. Nicholas and take this as an opportunity to devote ourselves to family traditions in the pre-Christmas period, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve and the Christmas holidays.
What was it like at home back then?
As with your partner?
Do you also want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is best for the children?
The boot polishing?
Plätzchenbacken?
Tree decoration?
Will be played?
Does Santa Claus, the Christ child or is the present from grandma and grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone gives themselves a lot of work around Christmas to have it as nice as possible as a family.
Whether this is now a firm tradition or even something different every year: tell us how it went or is going on in your family!
Please send me any transaction number... or anything else that could help
Transfer confirmation... etc
I would like to receive a voucher code
as with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Does that work for them?
The title is already given, I am an immunization doctor in mobile immunization teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly used in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be finished for the most part, it will then go on to vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, is that compatible with the vaccination...").
In my area of responsibility, there is the task of providing information about the vaccination, the indications for vaccination (a person has a right to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination order and no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care for allergic reactions (this has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often don't have any doctors, but only (please don't take this as a lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, who are not allowed to carry out vaccinations (are they?), so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Serious "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television broadcast "Wir in Bayern" has caused a lot of thought.
But unlike many previous days, the term "Host mi?" was not guessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not "a man who is nervous".
And also no one who "has to do everything quickly".
That, the people heard from the TV moderator, was completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg communicated as the solution and thus probably caused astonishment with many Upper Palatines.
The audience learnt that "Der Huidlerer" is a rag used to clean the stove.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the rather well-known dialect word "Houdern".
What was closed was an education gap - probably also for many who have lived in the Amberg room for a long time.
I have not been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always comes up: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted, connected, synchronized and repaired the #PRS_ORG#.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice for racing bike - really so safe?
This morning, I woke up full of energy because I wanted to do some training for my bike tour next week at least.
Said, done and I drove off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then it happened what lurks in every inner city (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear wheel did not want to participate in the rest of the track.
Since I had no real possibility on the weekend to get a replacement jacket and replacement hose, I had to turn around again with half-bad mood and take the first train home.
It was not quite so bad for me technically, perhaps it is better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike tour.
Now I'm facing a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long stretch over several days in front of me, I would rather not get this problem more often.
It was not so bad now, since the old tires of the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had ridden 120 kilometers on the day I picked up the bike!) and who had also described them as suboptimal because he had ridden them for many years.
But if I think that after 80-90 km I still have to change a tire, then I am really in a bad mood: D
Now I've got into conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be indestructible.
Now the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40 euros on a tire now, only to be disappointed later.
I also ask myself: I think I have 25x622 on the racing bike at the moment.
There are also (apparently) at the Marathon Plus tires, but most of them are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend me other tires for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute favorite! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and loving greetings!
Car slams into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had collided with a central reservation on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for reasons that are still unclear, and then swerved into the opposite lane, according to police.
There it came to a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The car of the 53-year-old was then hurled against a tree and the man in the car was trapped.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

However, in this building proposal, a suitably designed foot is included to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted in length to the conditions at home.
Principally, the SOLO 15 is very well suited to people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of generating such high sound pressure levels unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and, for her size, extremely impressive and accurate.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble boost.
This is common practice with broadband to optimize the increasingly high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is aimed precisely at the listening position and convinces with very clear and fine sound.
The high-frequency range can be reduced slightly and the sound image made warmer by turning the treble down slightly.
Thanks to the point source, the localization of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is razor sharp and breathtakingly precise.
The reference-suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an enemy dynamics that is looking for its equal.
The SOLO 15 thus not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our construction projects, it is recommended to think about the final optics of the speaker at the beginning, in order to plan appropriate changes to the construction.
If you want to furnish the housing, the lowering of the speaker must be adapted accordingly, as the veneer adds material again.
After all the plates have been cut to size (e.g. at the home improvement store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floorboard at the corresponding point, in order to be able to run the cable through it easily later.
With the help of an upper mold, the speaker opening in the front is now followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
On the back, this opening should be equipped with a 45° phase to design the opening area of the speaker chassis as large as possible.
The four connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the picture "detail phase".
Afterwards, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a level surface in front of oneself.
These are now glued to the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in thickness as required, for example when using ready-made profiles from the DIY store instead of making your own from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side will be attached.
After that, all the plates of the foot follow, that is, both sides and the front.
With the help of a suitable hole saw or a forestner drill, the installation of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection clamp on the back wall, is facilitated.
Afterwards, one uses a round saw to round off all corners of the actual box.
The top side of the footplate can also be rounded off.
Afterwards, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
This is followed by the marking and drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connection clamp.
After the casing has been cleaned of wood dust (sucking / blowing), the cable is laid.
The easiest way is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
In doing so, one pushes the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm drilling in the foot until the terminal opening and leaves it there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and is also left hanging loosely there.
Next, the frequency switch is prepared and used.
The construction plan for the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Installation instructions Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency switch is built in and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
With the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and a bit of skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now comes the dampening, according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and fastened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the plus pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the given length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be preserved.
Can I cancel an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello everyone,
> Finally, we can announce that we will also organize the OSCAST this year!
Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher level of planning and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the switch, so that we can follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still the pandemic - but we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Prepare drinks, plan a good meal and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
