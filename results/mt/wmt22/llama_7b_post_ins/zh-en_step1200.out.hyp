Using air to wash hands, sniffing to judge diseases, and accurately searching for the source of haze Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic conference of Zhejiang University, a series of outstanding academic achievements were honored.
The main researchers of these results are students, covering a wide range of fields such as the environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, and humanities education. Students started from a curious point and created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biological sensor: Your family doctor
Zhang Di Ming, a doctoral student at the Biomedical Engineering Institute, showed a smartphone-sized biological sensor.
All you need to do is take a deep breath, and the device can check your health condition from the gas components in your breath.
Zhang Di Ming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to an intelligent mobile phone. After calling for gas, a health report will be shown on the mobile phone.
Smart wristbands that can detect health conditions in the market generally test temperature, heartbeat, and other physical parameters.
This set of biological sensors uses a new type of material, graphene, to target chemical elements, and its sharp "feel" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health condition.
Smart surgical lights: Doctors' high-performance eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver medal at the 44th Swiss International Invention Exhibition this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master's degree students in the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented an intelligent LED surgical light.
Many diseases are diagnosed and removed at an early stage, which is related to the light in the doctor's surgery.
Shen Junfei said that, for example, if doctors cannot clear all the tumor tissues in the early diagnosis of cancer, the cancer cells will continue to spread.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four light plates, which can adjust the light spectrum to enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light irradiation.
During the surgical process, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and transparency of the light according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This kind of intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Shao Yifu Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College and Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College and has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Use air to wash hands: Provincial water is cool again
Ordinary people wash their hands by splashing water, rubbing in some soap, and squeezing out the soap. Li Qiang and other students invented a "air washing device".
Just stand on the washing machine and our weight can compress the air.
“It’s like pumping up a balloon.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the head of the water dragon and combines with the water.
This way, we can have clean hands! "
Visible reactions and bacterial retention experiments prove that the effect of this method of washing is the same as the ordinary washing method.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a drive, which can not only ensure the cleanliness of the process, but also save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out in many world-renowned colleges and universities and won the only gold medal.

A meaningful certificate - emergency certificate
This is one of the important skills certificates in addition to the driving license!
Speaking generally: emergency measures are actually emergency rescue when a disaster occurs, that is, rescue before the arrival of the rescue vehicle.
It is well known that in the process of coming to the rescue after the accident, there is still a certain period of time. It is precisely this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time for emergency.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, and stop breathing, our life window is only four minutes, golden four minutes!
Therefore, the people around understand how important the rescue is!
When someone falls in front of us, we can rescue him through professional knowledge instead of standing there helplessly and doing nothing, which is so terrible.
In China, 30 million people die of accidents every year, and the most dangerous moment is when the heart stops.
On average, 15% of people in the United States can be saved.
In the casino hotel in Las Vegas, 78% can save, while Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%.
This is the first response from Lu Lei.
If a person has a heart attack and stops breathing and has no heartbeat, you are useless.
It is necessary to use artificial respiration and chest compression to save people.
I found that nowadays, few people will have such awareness to learn emergency rescue, but it is useless when the incident occurs. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can make a timely response when facing emergency situations.
It can also save a person's life!
Emergency certification can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. Students can also enjoy preferential treatment.
PS: The last picture is a reminder of the goals I set for myself when I was 25. Adding the emergency card to the goal list was something that happened a few months ago, but it’s done now!
Next, he wanted to take other certificates to take the examination. He wanted to take the diving certificate. He saw a diving emergency certificate in the small red book. He thought that he could not take the examination without the emergency certificate. Therefore, the emergency certificate was very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
13 yuan for a shrimp dumpling?
No trial
What is #NAME# not clear?
Is it 13 yuan?
Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# leaked food, and this time a shrimp dumpling was given to me to eat!
Because I saw it was effective when I input the code before.
First of all, I personally believe that "Four Seasons" is a comprehensive film. From all kinds of meanings, it is.
But you have to say that this film is not a bright spot and is not at least a good selection.
There are many kinds of trailers, some of which can make you fall asleep in the cinema, some of which can make you feel guilty after watching, and "Four Seasons" is like a monkey on Mount Emei, which can use countless ways to ignite your anger.
In terms of humiliating the audience, Han Han really is a gift from heaven.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a character from a Gabriel García Márquez novel, difficult to name and full of holes like the windbreaker on a little boy.
Even after watching it, you may doubt whether there are any hidden meanings in it, but after careful consideration, you will find that it is just a pile of shit.
To put it simply, there are some things I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist lives in a small island in the south, and is inseparable from his grandmother.
Her grandmother wanted to see the snow, so the drama arranged for a big uncle to drive her to Northeast China to see the snow.
High-altitude elderly people sit on a bread truck to see snow from south to northeast?
He and his father are very relaxed about this.
Then the old man didn't write anything.
How did she get the business license to open a hotel on the abandoned ship?
Why can the flying car party on the island make the road smoothly and easily?
Then, a truck carrying steel bars stopped at the roadside and the drivers of the four surrounding trucks could not find it.
This is too obvious.
Why would a gang of unlicensed and illegal drivers become a traffic policeman?
In the face of high-interest loans, why did the police not report? In the film, the police asked whether there was any difficulty.
A person who knows how to use a smartphone does not know how to use the room card to open the door in the hotel, and then forces the hotel owner to arrange to find the hotel owner and sleep outside the room?
This inexplicable incident is full of the whole film. Because the incident is too embarrassing, I will feel pain when I recall it.
In addition to the plot, the worst thing about the film is its purpose, or rather, the fact that the film has no purpose at all, which is a face-saving excuse.
At the beginning of the film, you think he wants to make a comedy, but after more than 20 minutes, you think it may be an inspirational film. After half an hour, you think it may be a film about the survival of young people in the countryside. After watching it, you don't know whether you have really watched a film. This is followed by profound doubts about yourself. Why do you have to go to the cinema to enjoy yourself?
For most people, it is very familiar with the road of all kinds of films. For example, if you want to shoot a taxi driver, you can encourage + comedy and then tell the audience how to walk towards success one step at a time.
If you want to make an affectionate film, you can tell the story of the misunderstanding between the young people and the server sisters in the bicycle town.
If you want to reflect reality, the most important thing is that your episode cannot be in opposition to the normal world.
For example, the new character played by Yin Zhengming was burned, and then he could still sing.
In fact, the female lead, Miriam Yeung, is not a weak-minded person who can behave like a five-year-old in some ways. I don't know whether this is the reason for the performance or the requirement of the director.
There is also something I don't understand. Why is Han Hang so eager to add a car crash scene in his own film?
Such a film arrangement in the Spring Festival holiday, is it to give the audience a headache?

Inspection of well concrete mold production equipment Zhengzhou well brick mold equipment introduction:
Zhengzhou Yihui is a domestic concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment manufacturer, producing inspection well drilling machinery, inspection well wall body module machinery, and from semi-automatic to fully automatic production line.
Through years of practice and development, it now has a quality that is too hard, mainly producing liquid-pressure, mobile and all-automatic inspection well series equipment and accessories.
Inspection of the concrete mold module production equipment of the shaft Zhengzhou shaft wall brick module equipment assembly on the spot:
Inspection of well concrete mold production equipment Zhengzhou well brick mold equipment characteristics and advantages:
Yichun inspected the broad application of new brick materials for coal, heat, water, electricity, gas and other civil underground construction.
For example, the inspection of various types of drainage and water storage facilities such as wells, rainwater pits, trapezoidal ditches, chemical pits and small buildings, bridges and walls.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells lies in the fact that the upper and lower sides of the module are generally concave, forming a chain link with brick construction.
The anti-slip resistance of the wall body is far superior to that of the plain masonry.
The module is a hollow structure. Combined with brick masonry, the longitudinal and transverse holes are connected, and the transverse holes are in contact with each other. After pouring the core, a network of concrete is formed, which serves as a secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The module is equipped with cross-sectional reinforcements, which increase the overall strength of the structure in the longitudinal and transverse directions.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells made of concrete checked by the concrete inspection module are unlikely to collapse, sink, leakage and other phenomena. The mechanical stability of the well wall body module is stable, the operation is simple, and the molding size standard is met.
The intelligent control equipment of concrete inspection well drilling machine adopts a touch screen liquid crystal display to monitor the operation of the whole process, realizing ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of materials, density transportation, safety logical control and fault diagnosis system.
The wall body module mechanized liquid pressure system adopts single-tube liquid pressure and delivery, and double-tube liquid pressure and delivery.
The independent liquid pressure integration station avoids the impact of the main host on the liquid pressure system, thus ensuring the reliability of the liquid pressure system.
The brick machine equipment of concrete inspection well module rises from the mold, the hopper door is closed, the pallet is automatically conveyed, and the whole process is completed by the hydraulic system, thus reducing the wear and maintenance of the machinery.
The concrete inspection well module concrete machinery equipment adopts imported computers and electrical appliances, sealed components and liquid pressure components, and the overall performance and stability of the quenching equipment are reliable.
The reinforcing platform of the wall body module adopts an overall steel plate, and the cutting line of the table surface is welded without any joints, so that the concrete box can move freely and reduce the mechanical wear.
To reduce the load of the mold, add the filler and encrypt the vibration, we adopt the integration and full synchronization to ensure the vibration effect.
The vibration exciter and computer-controlled vibration amplitude adjust the amplitude of vibration according to the ratio of the cost of raw materials to the cost of the finished product, without wear and tear, thereby extending the service life and reducing costs.
The wall body model module has the dual functions of automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing pilot modern apprenticeship system for college students - Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that from this year onwards, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 middle schools. Students who are enrolled in the pilot training will have the status of apprentices and will be recruited by the pilot enterprises as unit employees after the enrollment.
The Municipal Commission on Ethnic and Religious Affairs requires that the recruitment of middle school students in vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identity of middle school students and enterprise staff be clarified. According to the principle of two-way choice, students, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement, and for students who have not reached 18 years of age by the end of the 16th year, a quadripartite agreement must be signed by the student, guardian, school and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific position, teaching content, and rights and interests of the student in the training.
We encourage pilot schools to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and cooperate with enterprises to carry out pre-employment training and in-service training.
The pilot school should reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training plans, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, position standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot uses the academic calendar as a pilot period. Students determine their internship time at the enterprise according to the professional talent training plan. The internship is generally 6 months.
In the implementation of enterprise practice, the enterprise team management model is adopted. According to the characteristics of different majors, one teacher can take 2 to 5 students to form a study group to ensure that the students master the skills required for each lesson.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to 2019 August, our city has determined 60 municipal intermediate modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches. The number of trainees in each batch is about 50, with a total of about 3,000 trainees (students).
According to the principle of pilot first and then carry out, we will explore and establish a long-term mechanism for the joint enrollment, joint training and integration of physical education of schools and enterprises, so as to effectively improve the skills of students' positions and the employment quality of students.

South African doctors: Ominous transmission of Ebola, but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the new variant of HIV-1 is less severe than that caused by the variant of HIV-1. Although the transmission speed is faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the mutation of the Ebola virus spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the province of Gauteng said in a report that the symptoms of the new patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and sore throats similar to those of flu.
The organization's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said he sees several dozen patients a day, but no one needs to be hospitalized.
Pile said: "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover in 10 to 14 days."
He said that these include elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to fall seriously ill due to HIV infection.
Compared with the previous outbreak, he said, "The new patients I treated had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will stay in the hospital for several days.
In the two weeks after the first report of an outbreak of Ebola virus in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although the collection of sufficient data will take a few weeks, the observation and early evidence of doctors have provided some clues.
According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, among the new cases of tuberculosis in hospitals in the past few weeks, only 30% were serious diseases. It was half the proportion of the previous outbreak. The average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days. Among the new cases of tuberculosis, only 3% died, while the death rate in the early outbreak cases in South Africa was 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the Africa Health Research Institute, cited data from the National Communicable Disease Research Center and other reports: "At present, almost all the signs indicate that this is a mild disease. "
He also said: "Now it is early, we need to get the later data.
Usually, the time from hospitalization to death is relatively late, and we only entered this epidemic two weeks ago. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Despite the fact that tuberculosis is still the world's leading new infectious disease, the number of cases of tuberculosis is increasing in many countries, including South Africa, which is the epicenter of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases discovered in the first week of December in Guangdong Province increased by 400%. Tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were Omicron variants.
Thank you for today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Where to find the actual discount code
Education Times Commentary: What should we do to rescue the kidnapped children?
If the famous public welfare slogan of "No buying and selling, no killing" is used, then in a good environment where there is no "sweeping" demand, mass prevention and control, and the whole people's anti-sweeping, the sweeping behavior is not profitable, the risk is great, and the cost is high. Such crimes will not occur again and again.
Recently, the Ministry of Public Security's Criminal Investigation Bureau set up a platform for the urgent release of information on the disappearance of children.
This is to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on the disappearance of children and to set up an Internet information platform for finding lost children in a timely manner.
Hearing the name of the App as "Round", I felt warm.
The new technology not only has the name of "culture" and "emotion", but also the information application is practical and effective.
The first goal of the crackdown is to find the kidnapped children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed as many "big words".
However, in the case of kidnapping, the safety of the victim should be given top priority.
The situation is easing slightly. Under the urgent "rescue" purpose, controversial topics such as "whether the selling of children should be punished by death" can be temporarily suspended and carefully discussed; but the rescue of the kidnapped children cannot be.
According to the experience of such cases, the human traffickers are likely to leave the crime scene as soon as possible after committing the crime.
The longer the search, the farther the child may be from the parents, and the difficulty of the investigation will also increase.
In this case, bringing out the direct and effective measures such as the "round table" platform to solve the case and find the child is a pragmatic action.
After all, "knocking out" is a big task that requires the entire legal system to work well.
In order to effectively combat crime, safeguard the rights and interests of children and parents, and ensure the smooth progress of law enforcement, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of "protecting the weak and vulnerable".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be improved from the family to the society.
For example, a common case, a family of three took a rest at the railway station, and the parents fell asleep. When they woke up, they found that their child was missing.
We should not expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, we should at least have considerable protection awareness.
It is the most effective means to prevent children from being snatched when their parents take turns to rest or put their children under the protection of others.
On the other hand, from the perspective of the police cracking down on the crime of buying and selling children, it is also necessary to pay attention to and punish those who buy and sell children.
A single illegal act is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, the statutory punishment for the crime of trafficking in children is 5 years; in cases of especially serious circumstances, the punishment may be death, and property may be confiscated.
With a high starting point and maximum penalty, trafficking in children is undoubtedly a serious crime under the general trend of "leniency."
There are still many trafficking cases every year.
It can be seen that some people's ideas about raising children are lagging behind, and their legal awareness is weak.
The legal education of these people should be synchronized.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking in persons, it is impossible to rely solely on the strict law enforcement of the authorities.
If the "market" is widespread, the traffickers are eager to make money, and constantly innovate trafficking means, forming a "fight" situation with law enforcement officials, and the anti-trafficking operation will inevitably fall into a low-efficiency quagmire.
Therefore, breaking the concept of backwardness, popularizing legal common sense, will also help to effectively prevent and punish the crime of buying and selling children.
Yang Hau Dong spoke on the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the provincial party congress
From the party's century of struggle for power
Report on December 10 in Hunan Daily (full media reporter Gong Bowei): According to the unified arrangement of the provincial party committee, on the morning of December 10, the provincial party committee standing committee member and the provincial party committee publicity department minister Yang Hau Dong gave an interactive lecture on the spirit of the 6th plenary session of the 19th CPC National Congress and the spirit of the important instructions and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on the important speech of the 19th CPC National Congress at the video creation park in Mao'an Mountain. He also learned the spirit of the 12th provincial party congress.
Yang Hau Dong expounds on the essence and requirements of the spirit of the whole meeting from three aspects: ideals and beliefs, self-revolution and youth party, and party leaders and party theory.
He pointed out that it is necessary to combine the spirit of the whole meeting and the important instructions and suggestions of General Secretary Xi Jinping to study, absorb and strengthen the consciousness of defending the "two establishments" and "two maintenances", and unswervingly advance along the direction of General Secretary Xi Jinping's guidance.
During the interactive exchange session, representatives of grassroots cadres, representatives of enterprises, and representatives of young people asked questions about the relationship between the three historic decisions, how to understand the decisive significance of "establishing two", how cultural enterprises grasp the direction, and how young people in the new era draw strength from the 100 years of party history. Yang Hau Dong answered the questions one by one in plain language and with vivid examples. He spoke to the young party members with great respect, saying that they should draw strength from the party's 100 years of struggle, closely unite around the party center, be unswervingly loyal to the party, and dedicate their youth to writing responsibilities and duties.

The International Olive Oil Council divides olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil).
Pure olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is directly extracted from fresh olive fruits by mechanical cold pressing and then filtered to remove impurities.
According to the different degrees of acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is superb, with delicate fennel plants and a pH of less than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: The acidity is slightly high, but does not exceed 2%, with a pure and fruity taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: Taste and aroma are still good, and the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3% after the first distillation of olive oil or becomes "second oil".
The refining of olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Ordinary olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to adjust the taste and color. Its acidity is less than 1.5%, and it is a pale golden yellow.
Refined olive pomace oil or olive pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): This is olive oil that is extracted from the pomace and refined.
You may have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is an important indicator.
It is known that olive oil is like wine made from grapes. Olive oil from different production areas and different olive varieties will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best growth place of oil olive:
The coastal areas of the sea have the most suitable soil, temperature, sunlight, air humidity and rainfall for oil olive growth.
In addition to the coast of the South China Sea, other areas can only be planted in the zero-star area.
Main production area (land):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon and other countries with similar climates are far south of the equator.
Olive harvest month:
Every year, from June to June, is the time for the oil olive tree to bloom. From October to October, the fruit begins to develop and mature, and finally changes from green to red, purple, and finally black.
The period from November to February of the next year is the fruit harvest season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutrients in olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the oils found so far.
The closing ceremony of the National People's Congress, Biden said the flame of freedom will never be extinguished
On Friday (December 10), the online "Democracy Summit" (Summit for Democracy) attended by the leaders of governments and civil society and private sectors from 110 countries, including the United States President Donald Trump, came to a close.
In his closing speech, Biden said that the torch of freedom burns in the hearts of people all over the world, and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second Global "People's Congress" next year.
Taiwan's representative to the United Nations, Permanent Representative to the United Nations and Other International Organizations in Geneva, Tang Feng, and the Hong Kong democracy activist, Law Chi-kwong, who is currently in exile in the United Kingdom, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult it is to work in front of us.
But we also know that we can meet the challenges, because as I said before, the democratic world is everywhere.
The special regime can never extinguish the flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said: "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the protection of democracy, promote reform, realize transparent inquiry governance, and better resist the power of monopoly and impact, as well as those who pursue power at the expense of the public interest. "
The themes of the second day of the "Democratic Congress" were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and combating authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
In his opening speech on the same day, UN Secretary-General Guterres also said that the democratic cause is facing challenges all over the world, especially the challenges brought about by new emerging technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reiterate common values and positions and democratic vitality.
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving the problem of inequality, fighting corruption, updating social concessions, investing in quality education, and expanding the opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a resolute denunciation of all forms of populism, localism and extremism, including all the tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Hong Kong democracy activist Law Chi-kwong delivered a speech at the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue paying attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in Hong Kong and Tibet.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been subjected to China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to question it.
This is why political leaders and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Luo Gan also called on the free world to unite to fight the threat of the CPC.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of angering General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and maybe some of you are not aware of the threat of the (Communist) Party to our democratic values.
And this is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason we must change. "
At the round-table discussion on "Fight against digital authoritarianism and affirmation of democratic values," held by the Policy Committee of the Executive Yuan of Taiwan, the video of the "National Declaration" was released to emphasize that Taiwan is at the forefront of fighting against the authoritarianism and the power monopoly.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the new coronavirus outbreak through information transparency and building trust.
He said: "In the face of Taiwan's democratic progress, we have always stood at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and have also played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, the authoritarian governments in various places took the name of public health and collective interests to rationalize the violation of human rights, and the global democracy showed signs of decline.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to seal the city to control the epidemic, and we do not have to withdraw to fight the false information. "
On the same day of the "Democratic Summit", the US Treasury announced the imposition of sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea and other countries for serious violations of human rights. At the same time, a Chinese company was sanctioned for using surveillance technology to assist in violations of human rights.

Hello, the mouthwatering chicken from the restaurant is fresh.
I wanted to try playing tennis, but I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to stick to it, so I wanted to find a cheap coach first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often inversely proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, the valuable normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap camera, such "entry-level cameras" are actually industrial waste.
They are low in intensity, and when the ball hits the rim, the vibration is very strong. The hard ball cannot be stopped, and the players are very difficult to control.
Their logic and slogan words are: it is so difficult to play tennis. You know that you don't study, and you know that you don't care about the expensive rackets. Just mess around with cheap goods. You can play for fun twice, and you won't play again. This is a cheap racket, and you don't care.
If you can really distinguish between good and bad, it shows that you have progressed, and I will come here to buy expensive things when I have money.
It is recommended to buy a good second-hand ball at a similar price. Choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not well known, so the good ball is also sold at a low price. The new 500 and 600 are good, and the second-hand 200 pieces are not worth it?
Friendly to newcomers, but once past the newcomer stage, it is all downhill, but most people, especially women, never get past the newcomer stage.

In fact, for girls who are physically thin, there are many things to talk about.
The dress of a fat girl should not be too short or too long. The difference in length is not much more than the knee, just enough to cover the buttocks.
If the skirt is too short, the fat on the legs will be exposed.
If it is too long, it will give people the feeling of being short and fat.
If you put on the upper, middle, and lower sections, you will naturally look taller. It's just that you're wearing different-colored pants, shirts, and long socks, and it looks like you're wearing lifts.
In fact, many deep-colored clothes are the trademark of petite girls (the author has a deep understanding of this). Deep colors are also a good way to hide your body fat, and a black short skirt is the first choice of petite girls.
Wearing deep-colored clothes, especially black shorts, will make you feel thinner.
If your legs are fat, you should not wear too tight pants and shoes.
The greater the diversity, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
So as not to attract attention to your legs and feet, let people feel fat.
For girls who are slightly plump, it is necessary to tell them about the good combination of clothes.
A little girl should not wear a tight skirt. In addition, she should not wear a short skirt or pants that are too short, which will make her look uncomfortable. If her legs are fat, she should wear a black long sock or a net sock (a kind of lace sock), choose a soft and comfortable printed skirt, and wear a belt to cover the shortcomings of the fat girl.
Of course, the little girl in the short skirt is also worth talking about.
A fat girl wearing a short skirt should choose a blouse that matches the color of the short skirt, so that your fat body will have an increased effect.
Shorts paired with high-heeled shoes can make your legs look longer, which is perfect for the summer!
If you are fat in the body but thin in the legs, you are recommended to choose a beautiful short skirt.
Not only can it hide your flaws, but it can also show your advantages.
A short skirt is very obvious, suitable for fat girls, and the top should be tight to form a layered effect.
A simple white T-shirt can be paired with a short skirt. Fat MM can also try.
The petite girl is also fashionable.
As long as they can master the rules of wearing clothes, the petite girls will also be the focus of attention.
In terms of dressing up, after the change, we should move more in life and strive to get rid of the label of being a little fat girl as soon as possible.

Girl shoots for her sister's donation: "It's better to think of it as a flesh wound" - Xinhuanet
A girl stood in front of a big wooden board at the Hangzhou Wulin Plaza. The board had the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan one arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl Gao Dandan 'arrow recruitment' for sisters" exploded in the circle of friends.
The photo shows that a girl stands in front of a high wooden board in Hangzhou Wulin Square. The board has the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan and one arrow" written on it, indicating that after paying the roadman, you can use a bow and arrow to shoot.
This behavior triggered hot debate among netizens.
Last night, the person in charge of publicity of the Chengdong Sub-Bureau of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such an impulsive move because she wanted to donate money to her sister. However, such behavior is not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl on the street "arrow" to solicit donations
In the net photo, a long-haired girl of "Q" type stands in front of a wooden board. The words "human flesh trademark, 10 yuan, one arrow" are written in black ink on the wooden board. Another wooden board in front of her has her bank account number and WeChat and Alipay account numbers written on it.
The picture caused controversy after being posted online.
Some netizens said that this behavior is "the bidding behavior of the telescope", and many netizens expressed the same opinion.
We found the situation at about 10 o'clock on the morning of the 23rd when we patrolled the square. At that time, the crowd had dispersed.
According to a local media interview at the Tianshui police station near the scene of the incident, there were a total of two girls, all aged around 20, and dressed in youthful and beautiful costumes.
Among them, the girl who played the "human flesh target" was crying, and the passerby played the game; another girl stood by the roadside and asked for help, saying that her aunt, who was her friend, had leukemia and urgently needed surgery fees.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's treatment of leukemia.
Last night, the person in charge of publicity of the Chengdong Sub-Bureau of Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Jia Li, and she donated the money to her sister Jia Yanyu.
However, because the treatment still needs more than 300,000 yuan, it was difficult to think of a good way to raise funds.
He said that throughout the process, the two girls were the target and the person responsible for beating, but they did not participate, and no one shot arrows throughout the process, only that someone observed and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After the police checked with the Ministry of Public Security, it was found that the bow used did not fall within the scope of control.
The person in charge said, "We do not advocate adopting this kind of fundraising method."
After being warned by the police, she left the police station.

What is the hottest in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win medals?
A few days ago, an article titled "Quick Look: Project Managers Can Win Gold Medals in Olympic Projects" was very popular. It mentioned that project managers can absolutely be the best at their first attempt in many projects, and no one can compete with them. Moving rocks, going out, and staying up late are the daily routine of project managers. Saving fires, cooking, and apologizing are not even mentioned.
It seems like a funny article, but it also reflects the daily hard work of the project managers. Behind it is the current project management work.
And people engaged in project management work are also gradually choosing to let themselves out of the dilemma through some actions.
According to the number of PMP (Project Management Professional) registrants, more and more project management professionals are learning to improve their project management skills.
According to the "China Project Management Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® candidates in China was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified people was about 420,000, and the number of effective certificate holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total PMP® certificate holders in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certified professionals has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers have realized that relying on the simple experience of the past is no longer effective. The ever-changing work environment tells us that we should learn one thing and explore the path ahead.
However, can the PMP ensure the smooth operation of project management work?
Many project management beginners said that through the study of PMP/IPMP and other relevant courses, they can systematically master the ten major areas and five processes of project management and other relevant knowledge points, but when it comes to actually doing project management work, it is still a headache.
Many project managers often report the following problems: The project management knowledge is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, there is no project management theory, and do not know how to practice; Lack of systematic project management process system, unable to work in the process, the project is estimated to be inaccurate, the degree of control and sensitivity is poor, the project is dragged and dragged; The division of labor is not clear, the "old oil" in the team is not how to deal with the cross-departmental communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to promote...
Therefore, the field of specialized product innovation and R&D management has a burden of more than 10, and has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers and project managers and other R&D key talents, and has won the honorary title of "China's enterprise R&D management talent training demonstration base" and other honors.
Online Course of "Research and Development Project Manager Special Training" This is an online way to learn broken chemistry. Combined with the practical cases, tools and methods of many research and development-type enterprises, it helps you master the essential knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the path of your own project management.
This is also a way for enterprises to use lower costs and less investment to promote the training process of project managers and bring opportunities for enterprises to achieve high-efficiency operation results.
Speaking without evidence, you can first see what other students think of this course: This course is not only taught by the expert team of Chinatech, which was the former Huawei R&D management team, in conjunction with the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises, but also provides in-depth and superficial professional explanations of the course content.
Moreover, it will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods and rich templates to help students convert the content learned in the classroom into specific work.

Jingdong "Double 12" before the consumer advocates rational consumption - Economic Observer - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double 11" online payment business transaction volume reached 177 billion yuan, a new high compared with previous years.
The colorful and generous red envelopes caught the eye of the viewers. The live broadcast of the express delivery has once again benefited the consumers. The consumption boom on one hand makes people lament the growing strength of national consumption, on the other hand, it also makes people reflect on the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumers.
On the eve of the "Double Twelfth", Jiaotong Consumption Financial Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiaotong Consumption") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the general public, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 over 2019.
On the whole, China's residents have performed well in financial consumption, but there are still big differences in financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and the young is relatively low, and the "one elderly and one young" will still be the focus of financial education. The "China Youth Debt Report" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CNBC show that the young generation has a huge potential for consumption. Credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people use credit products. Nearly half of them do not have debt. Although the overall consumption trend of the young generation is rational, it is in line with the "overheating" label posted by the outside world. However, some young people have excessive consumption and consumption behavior, and thus have created too much financial pressure and debt, and even caused social problems to increase. Financial enterprises should be willing to bear social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed financial institution, Jiaotong has always been committed to providing quality and caring services to help the common people build their own happiness life. It advocates that consumers establish a correct consumption view and actively respond to the call of supervision to improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people.
In the past few years, Jiaotong has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and launched various forms of innovation and practice competitions in cooperation with top domestic colleges and universities to guide the rational consumption demand of young people in a reasonable way, help them establish a rational consumption concept, plan consumption demand in a reasonable way, and thus help them accumulate personal life wealth.
On the eve of the 12th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Jiaotong Bank reminded all consumers to establish reasonable consumption awareness and correct views on money, combat blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumption loans, and avoid affecting personal credit and future economic life.
It is necessary to plan consumption in advance and pay on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the economic life of buying a car and buying a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, we should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to whether the relevant institutions have the qualification to operate.
In the future, Jiaotong will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated financial products to bring more compatible services to consumers, continuously help the masses improve their financial knowledge and help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, so as to become a reliable financial partner for consumers.

Vietnamese People's Daily Online - The Coastal Cooperation Committee should respond to common challenges
The stopover stations of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman include Aman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit to Qatar by Mohammed bin Salman since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Persian Gulf.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt broke off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive ban on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have had a negative impact on the unity of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the economies of countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the Bay of Bengal Summit in January 2021, when the Bay of Bengal countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Côte d'Ivoire to move towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are trying to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors by the two countries.
The Gulf Arab countries resolved their differences in order to restore their relationship with Qatar, which was cut off, out of the need to unite and cope with common challenges.
During the visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two countries.
The 725-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens of the two countries and the integration of supply chains.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest $5 billion in the United Arab Emirates, and the two countries' enterprises have signed a 13-item memorandum of understanding worth $30 billion.
The visit of the Gulf countries to Saudi Arabia coincides with Iran's nuclear agreement with the world's major powers, which is known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - an agreement between a Gulf Arab country and Iran to negotiate on the Iranian missile issue, which the Arab country believes cannot be resolved.
All the coastal countries have regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
All coastal countries believe that it is deficient to not solve the Iranian missile issue and not take actions to curb Iran's activities in the region.
After the talks between major powers and Iran failed to meet the expectations of the coastal states, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct talks.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that have slowed down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The upcoming summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council will be the first summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries since the end of the dispute with Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Bay of Bengal Cooperation Committee to re-evaluate its diplomatic achievements in order to promote the restoration of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation. At the same time, it proposes various measures to enable its member countries to fully cooperate in order to deal with common challenges and make contributions to the stability and development of coastal countries.

It is said that the sound of the new mountain area is the largest!
This time, our team brought this car, which is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the Murcielago's replacement - the Aventador LP700-4!
With a price of nearly 20 million yuan, a year's road tax of tens of thousands of yuan, four-wheel drive, why is it called the LP700?
Can you imagine how fast you can go with 700 horses?
Well, I don't know either. According to the data, you only need 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h. That's about the time it takes for myvi to accelerate from 30km/h to 100km/h. Yeah.
The low-slung body, the sharp-edged scissor doors, the huge air intakes that ring the car, and the 6.5-litre V12 engine, all perfect interpretations of Lamborghini's style.
For the description of the car, you don't need to say too much. Just Google it, and I've compiled some of the explanations that Google doesn't give!
It is too eye-catching. Everyone is looking at it. It is not self-evident! (It is a little cool)
1km of oil money is about RM1 (the car owner does not care)
The posture of getting on and off the car should be practiced. Otherwise, it will be a bit embarrassing (because it will not be able to get out of the car).
The sound of the engine is too loud, and the ears will be deafened after getting off. (but it is still cool)
The car is too big, and it will be very narrow to stop in the ordinary parking lot. I am afraid to be hit by the door of the car next to me when it opens!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (little editor, unrelated to the driver, Haha)
Don't misunderstand, this video is not for sale, sorry!
If you are a friend who wants to take a video of your car, welcome to contact us!

Let college students and the spirit of the times resonate at the same frequency - Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of study concepts and value pursuits formed by a university in the development process, which is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit has been important to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and society.
From the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from that of other social organizations. For Chinese universities, emerging in the national crisis, its spirit is even more deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocates the value of "enlightening the world and governing the country well" and the patriotism of "building a strong country".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is increasingly obvious. The global competition, scientific and technological competition and talent competition are increasingly intensifying. As an important "supply side" of higher education, the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and World-Class Disciplines" shows not only China's confidence and determination in becoming a high-level educational power, but also higher and more updated requirements for the development of universities.
How to climb to the top of the world in a short period of time and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class majors on the basis of a certain gap, so as to realize the "overtaking car"?
In addition to the unswerving confidence in the goal, path and ability, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: First, the advantage of backwardness, through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learn from the advanced experience of world-class universities, and achieve a significant improvement in academic level and study quality; Second, the advantage of culture, inherit the wisdom accumulated in the five thousand years of Chinese civilization, promote the development of excellent traditional culture, and use it to consolidate strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; Third, the advantage of system, give full play to the superiority of the system of socialist countries, strengthen the target drive, consolidate the consensus, optimize the resource allocation, and provide a solid guarantee for colleges and universities to accelerate the overtaking of the world's advanced level.
In particular, we should be aware that building a world-class university cannot be achieved by building thousands of schools at the same time, and that each school must highlight its strengths and characteristics.
Study characteristics must have a common Chinese characteristic, but also reflect the unique target positioning, study tradition and resource endowment of each school.
With regard to Zhejiang University, we focus on three characteristics in our study: first, we highlight the training of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated educational environment that combines science and education, and form a whole-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; second, we highlight the cross-disciplinary meeting of disciplines, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, and create a systematic environment for cross-disciplinary meetings; third, we highlight the study system and social service characteristics, carry out in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a comprehensive cooperation system among universities in Zhejiang Province.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, "seeking innovation" campus training, "study hard, be virtuous, be discerning, and be down-to-earth" values, and "Hainan River, Qi Zhenhua, Kailuan, and Shu Bao Guo" constitute the latest expression of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of study, continuously accumulate cultural heights and condense spiritual power, and is rich in connotation and deep in meaning.
Among them, "Hainan River and Yangtze River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the pride of "using talents from all over the world", and reflects the quality concept of striving for world-renowned universities to educate talents. "Qi Zhen Houding" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth from facts, that is, while pursuing the truth, universities should also adhere to the tradition of Confucius and the personality of filial piety. "Qi Weiwu" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, including the pursuit of new knowledge, scientific research, and reform and development. It also reflects the spirit of patriotism, that is, universities should always share weal or woe with the country.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuit is precisely the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of study.
The wise man listens to silence and sees the invisible.
In order to further establish the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics and deeply understand the historical mission of the cause of higher education, Chinese colleges and universities should accelerate the process of building world-class universities.
At the same time, we must adhere to humanistic care and independence, let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times stimulate each other, and provide a strong impetus for the realization of national prosperity and rejuvenation and the realization of the common ideal of humanity.

At the time of NFT's launch, a new concept of encrypted communities has emerged.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs during the pandemic began to receive stable income from this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet breeding game based on blockchain technology. It includes a variety of NFT games and is currently the NFT project with the highest trading volume, with a current trading volume of more than $3 billion.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeded 8.2 million US dollars, directly competing with "King of Glory".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The heat of "Axie Infinity" will convey a new "palytoearn" model to more people. Through the help of blockchain and intelligent contracts, players are no longer a single role, in addition to being able to obtain fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the ecological governance of the game.
This subjectivity is not given by the game producer, but by the blockchain technology.
Seeing news about the stock price of a friend, my biggest feeling is the choice of enterprises on the track, that is, the choice of the industry of the investment target. First, it is necessary to choose an industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least 100 billion yuan; second, it is necessary to choose an industry with good growth prospects in the future, considering that the growth rate of the industry will reach its best state in the next three to five years; finally, it is necessary to choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track is the scale of the market, the length of the track is the stage of development of the industry, and the shape of the track is the competitive landscape of the industry.

The art of war is to "do the things right," that is, to do things correctly.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing," that is, to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find the direction, and the art is to land. In most military thinking, there is a space for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking) can be thought of as whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend to other fields (strategic thinking); for example, how to improve the retention rate of customers (tactical thinking) can be considered how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); for increasing the participation rate of activities (tactical thinking), it is necessary to consider how to set the correct KPI of activities, achieve the correct activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating silent high-value customers, and precisely attracting new customers; for improving DAU (tactical thinking), it is necessary to consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.

American-Asian group complains of discrimination in the recruitment of three well-known universities such as Yale - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Washington D.C., May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and Justice on May 23, protesting the discrimination of three elite universities - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College - against Asian American applicants during the recruitment process.
The Asian American Education League, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukang, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of US elite universities has increased by times, but the proportion of Asian students in these three US elite universities has basically remained the same.
Many studies show that in the so-called "comprehensive assessment" of the admission process, "long-term and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants" occurs.
Zhao Yukui introduced that the research of scholars such as Sander in 2014 showed that in these three colleges and universities, the number of relative applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all the colleges and universities in the Ivy League, Brown University and the University of Dartmouth have the lowest admission rate for Asian students, while the University of Pennsylvania and Brown University have practically capped the number of Asian applicants at 20% for 20 years.
Zhao Yukui told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they expected the US Department of Education and Justice to conduct an investigation after the submission of the complaint, and to take measures to prevent these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in the recruitment process after determining the facts.
They also hope that colleges and universities can take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change the admission policy for Asian students.
At present, the three universities that have been sued have not made any response.
The Asian American Education League was established in 2015, and at that time it complained to Harvard University about discrimination in admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept the reason for the procedure.
In addition to the US-based Chinese American group, other groups that participated in the complaint include Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American and Pakistani American education groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Yuyang Town, Zhejiang Province, from a real estate agent. After many on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory building.
In December of the same year, after negotiations with Mr. Lin, the owner of the house, Mr. Lu transferred 200,000 yuan by bank transfer as a deposit on the same day.
Lin signed as the collector on the "Factory Buy and Sell Price List". It was stipulated that "if the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agreed to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within one week."
However, after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on major contractual issues such as the scope of factory buildings for sale and payment methods, the housing purchase and sale contract could not be signed.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, Mr. Lin returned 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu a few days later.
It is not easy to see the house in China. The down payment is ready. It is just a matter of signing the contract. The seller did not sell and Mr. Lu was frustrated.
To this end, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin to the People's Court of Yuyao City.
After trial, the court held that since the two parties failed to sign the formal contract at last, it cannot be held solely responsible for the defendant. It is reasonable to determine that the consultation has failed. Therefore, the case should not apply the fixed penalty. The defendant does not need to bear the breach of contract liability twice.
After the verdict, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the appeals court upheld the original verdict.
【Lawyer reminder】 In the course of the transaction, it is necessary to pay attention to the necessary caution.
When signing the contract, as a buyer, it is necessary to make every possible effort to make due diligence, such as verifying the information of the property ownership and whether the house is occupied by others, and clarifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes from arising when the contract is performed.
（German Voice） After the conclusion of the "Democratic Peoples' Congress" on Friday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a talk on Saturday (December 11) that the holding of the "Leaders' Democratic Peoples' Congress" by the United States is "drawing a line in the consciousness, democratizing and weaponizing democracy, falsifying the name of democracy and opposing the reality of democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and transferring domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, implemented the 'democratic reform', imposed unilateral sanctions, provoked the 'color revolution', and caused disastrous consequences.
Democracy has already become the "big killer weapon" of the United States against its allies.
This summit is Biden's action to fulfill his election promise.
The two-day meeting was held by video conference, and the leaders of 111 countries were invited, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democratic problems and said that the United States did not have the qualification to hold such a summit.
There are also questionable voices in the international community and the United States. For example, some leaders who attended the summit, including some authoritarian leaders, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, have questioned the real intentions of the Biden government and suspected that the summit was organized for geopolitical purposes rather than for democracy.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was just sworn in, also attended the video conference.
The statement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday said, "Today's American democratic disease is obvious. Money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social fracture, racial discrimination, and income inequality are becoming more and more serious." The American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on the capital base.
In his speech, U.S. President Donald Trump said, "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the protection of democracy, promote reform, realize transparent inquiry governance, and better resist the power of monopoly and impact, as well as those who seek power at the expense of the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not inevitable, "We must constantly update it in every generation, in my opinion, this is a decisive challenge in our era. "
Biden also said, "In the face of continuous and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The United States has pledged to carry out an action plan lasting one year, including an initiative for $4.244 billion to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media outlets.
The United States hopes that all countries will make specific public commitments before the 2022 summit to improve their democratic systems.
Biden said, "Let all our countries implement our commitments and report our progress next year."
Fortunately, I only fear that he sent the wrong address.
Jichang Restaurant (Five-Door Branch)
Thin-sliced beef: Chinese standard Chinese cut [Service bell] Service: The soup came quickly. My must-eat dish, Malay cake, is too fragrant and too soft. It’s delicious! My little companion who loves desserts must try the Eggplant in Malay Sauce. The eggplant is very fresh and beautiful. The sauce...
The taste is great, the meat is good, and the service is warm.
It's been a long time since I came to Jiachang. The fruits are so delicious that I can't help but to drink and the snacks are so authentic that I can't help but to be amazed. The first time I tasted the steamed bread, I was amazed by the southern flavor of my beloved mochi!
The dish is cooked to the right degree, the portion is very generous, and the Sichuan-style stuffed chicken wings are as popular as ever, the example soup is not bad, and the caramelized onions are also quite good...
The taste is great, the service is warm, and the meat is good.
Nichang Old Shop. Many years ago, it was the place to be for net celebrities. A wooden two-storey building.
You always have to wait a long time before you can eat the delicious rice, and the pot of delicious rice is broken...
It's been a few years since I've eaten at Jiaotong, and the rise of various small stores has led to the dispersion of customer flow.
It is difficult to find a seat in the store. The quality of the food is not good. It is as good as before.
Delicious, meat is good, main dish is praised
Yichang foreign trade.
Breakfast: The food was a little disappointing this time.
Three cups of chicken: There is a little more vegetables and a little less chicken meat.
The taste is a little biased. The bottom taste is not enough. It highlights the sweetness. Everyone can compensate for the sweetness with various spices...
What is the red card?
Everyone's love is different. Some people like to collect, some people like to eat, and of course, some people like wine and whisky. One of the best-selling Scottish whiskies is the Red Label, which has won the International Wine and Spirits Award.
Every bottle of red wine has its own unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, you're drinking it wrong.
So how does the red card warrior drink?
The editor introduces to you simply.
Red card warrior drinks:
The whisky is a blend of about 35 Scottish whiskies, with rich fruit and traditional Scottish whisky characteristics, with rich fruit and smoky flavors.
The aroma is fresh and slightly woody with a hint of tobacco.
The drink can be directly mixed with ice or mixed with the favorite drink.
Red Star Cigarettes entered the Chinese market. In order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese, Red Star Cigarettes + Coca-Cola or Snowflake or Xuebi or New Wonder became a long-lasting fashion.
In addition to being sweet and sour, these drinks can also bring comfort to the eyes. When added to drinks, they can also change the taste of the drink.
Red envelopes, candy canes, and sugar are the most traditional and correct way to drink.
The aroma of real red dates is a little sour, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, and orange will bring a fresh aroma to the wine. Of course, the sweetness can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best drinks for red card warriors. Everyone can try as a reference. I hope that the introduction of the little editor can help everyone.
Education Thought: How the College Entrance Examination Makes "School Bully" and "School Snob" - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou University of Transportation wrote a letter to the school leadership, reflecting the difficulties of the college entrance examination and proposing to increase the difficulty of the examination, change the examination topic, and make the examination truly reflect the actual level of students.
Yes, for a long time, college entrance examination has been a "hot topic".
In the university campus, students come from five lakes and four seas. Their ability levels are different, and the degree of difficulty is different. The situation of learning is thousands of times worse.
For a group with such diversity, there are different feelings, and it is inevitable.
Of course, if the examination topic is single and the repetition rate is high, the topic is too simple, it will inevitably cause another kind of sudden feeling.
Students who do not work hard may be able to pass the examination if they concentrate on it. If they want to try other methods, they may achieve a half-success effect.
In this way, "study phobia" that does not put in much effort can pass the test, and even get a high score; "study bully" does not go to classes, does his homework and takes good notes, but does not study much for the test.
It seems that the students of Lanzhou University reflect the problems existing in the college entrance examination, and it is believed that such a situation does not only exist in Lanzhou University.
From this level of meaning, we should applaud the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, those who have gone to college are well aware that many people are prepared for the college entrance examination and think of various ways to "solicit" questions from teachers and fight for the scope of the examination in order to obtain the phenomenon of "key guidance" before the examination and even during the examination.
In the author's opinion, as a quality assessment direction, the assessment of whether a college entrance examination is qualified, and more importantly, the comprehensive grasp of teachers on teaching and learning, and scientific themes based on this foundation.
Entering the undergraduate stage of college, the majors begin to be divided, and many majors are mainly based on basic knowledge.
It is undeniable that whether one has mastered the basic knowledge points of a subject is one of the contents to be examined in the college entrance examination.
And the basic knowledge of undergraduate students is mainly subject theory and basic common sense. From the point of view of knowledge, the space of change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
Just as the teacher said, "The basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago is still important now."
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, and it does not mean that the examination topics are single and repeated.
In many colleges and universities, the examination is usually composed of a group of questions, and the examination paper is coordinated by subject experts and senior teachers, and the examination reading is also participated in by all the teachers of the subject, so that it can to some extent overcome the situation of question repetition.
However, it is necessary to put forward a set of test items that are in line with the actual situation of teaching and learning. The title is based on the overall situation of student learning, and the distribution is difficult to be normal. It also needs to comprehensively master the educational situation, fully analyze the degree of student learning, and thus make the test items dynamic, so as to highlight the inspection of basic knowledge, take into account the inspection of abilities, and at the same time, innovate the design of the test items.
The examination is the commanding baton of university education. What kind of examination, students will have corresponding preparation scheme. In the past, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the student's suggestion, the Lanzhou University has attached great importance to it and has implemented the plan of rectification in the whole school.
It requires all educational institutions to organize teachers to conduct seminars and end-of-course exams, formulate examination questions and relevant regulations, strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination questions and the review process, and refine the grading to strengthen the comprehensive assessment of the course.
It is a problem that needs to be faced by the college entrance examination system to solve the problem of single-type questions and the repetition of topics. Of course, corresponding regulations need to be introduced, but it is a daily struggle. It requires teachers to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation. It is not only to eat the educational content, but also to eat the student learning situation. The two heads are eaten through, the teaching and learning will be better connected, the examination will be more in line with the actual situation, and the "students" and "study" will be better.

Photography of the bride's wedding dress (Nanjie store) is temporarily unavailable
Because we didn't arrange the time before shooting, we changed the time twice, and the consultant Lan Lan helped us arrange the time patiently.
Later, they chose a good weekend to shoot.
The staff of the queen of jade are all praised by the consultants, make-up artists and photographers.
That was the first time I had my makeup done professionally. Wow, I can't believe I'll look this good one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and her other sister (sorry, I don't remember her name) are very patient and natural in makeup.
The scenery was filmed in Jiangyin City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day. It was not cold. When we were shooting, the make-up artist kept reminding us of our clothing, headgear, and a little bit was not good, so he helped us to sort it out immediately.
The photographer is also very mysterious. He feels very happy to take pictures every day.
In the process of selecting photos, because I have seen many cases on the Internet, I don't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we select photos, we really don't have the idea of adding photos. There is not much difference between 24 photos in the set meal and one photo. I was shocked when I heard that my tablemates, who were about to take wedding photos, took more than 7,000 photos. I was afraid that I would take too many.
Today, the photo was finished, and Lan Lan gave it to me. I looked at it and thought it was not good. He immediately helped me to redo it.
Compared with the photos taken by sisters before, I think our photos are really satisfactory, simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go and take a photo with Grandma Han Jin!
Set price: 3999 yuan
The Queen thanks you for your sincere wishes and hopes that you will have a happy and prosperous journey ahead!

3,200 newborn babies in Saba do not have birth certificates due to special anti-counterfeiting paper
（Ya'an, August 11 report）The Saba National People's Registration Bureau said that since the beginning of October, it has been unable to issue birth certificates on paper to newborn babies because of the special anti-counterfeiting paper, which has affected 3,200 people.
However, the director of the bureau, Kari Amins, assured that all the babies who have applied for the birth certificate have been recorded in the system, and the supplement will be delivered next week.
At the press conference, he responded to a report by a web media outlet on the issue of a 10-month-old problem with the printing of the Sha Bao newspaper.
He said that the problem occurred two months ago, and Sandra also faced the same problem.
One reason is that the production of special anti-counterfeiting paper by Chinese factories has been affected by the epidemic, leading to a delay in shipment to China.
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in the Sabao Newspaper is different from that in other regions, so it cannot be used as a collateral for other states.
Kai Ru Amins revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper was delivered to Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then delivered to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing.
The bureau will send staff to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and return to Sabah to carry out the final stage of printing. It is estimated that the application can be handed over to the applicant on two working days (December 20).
We will notify the applicants to go to the local branches to receive the newspaper.
He added that Saba has issued a total of 24,801 newspapers since the beginning of this year.
From 7 o'clock to now
Is that it?
I'm talking about food.

A few days ago, Chinese Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina Qi Ping met with Chairman of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee Kvesic at the Olympic Center in Sarajevo.
During the meeting, Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic spoke highly of the relations between the two countries and said that she was impressed by the excellent organization of the Chinese side during her visit to the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008. She believed that China is capable of doing a good job in the Winter Olympic Games. The Balkan side is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympic Games and the Balkan Olympic Committee is actively organizing the participation. The Balkan side hopes to take this opportunity to conduct more extensive exchanges and cooperation with China in the field of sports.
Qiang said that China and Pakistan have a special "Olympic link".
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics was successfully held here. Two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open the curtain, presenting a simple, safe and wonderful show to the world.
It is expected that the two countries will deepen exchanges and cooperation in the preparation of winter sports competitions, athletes' training, etc. The Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play the role of a bridge, take advantage of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, and promote the continuous deepening of humanities exchanges between the two countries, so that the people of the two countries can "go to the future together," and wish the athletes of Bosnia and Herzegovina a good performance in Beijing.
Before the meeting, the BOC held the "10th Annual Best Athlete" award ceremony, and Jiang Ping, as a special guest, awarded the Best Young Athlete of the BOC.

48 hours of nuclear acid darkness and the establishment of a "buffer zone" require the strengthening of port city epidemic prevention and control - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reported by Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) -- The Notice on Strengthening the Prevention and Control of the New Coronavirus Infection Situation in Port Cities, issued by the State Council's Leading Group for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, requires that personnel who have recently left land border cities (excluding Hong Kong and Macao) should have a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and that at least one nucleic acid test should be conducted on personnel arriving in land border cities.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date of determining the port city scope of each province and city and announcing it to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that qualified port cities may study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control areas within the district.
According to the relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy, and the flow of people across the border is frequent.
Implementing the policy of differentiated management of epidemic prevention and control, the prevention and control line is changed from one to two lines, and it is expected to achieve the relocation before the port, reduce the risk of epidemic outbreak, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and social cost.
Recently, a number of local epidemic outbreaks have occurred in China, all of which are imported from foreign epidemic situations.
The above notice pointed out that some local epidemic monitoring and early warning, high-risk staff closed-loop management, regular nuclear acid testing, cold chain items are not destroyed in place, centralized isolation management, and epidemic emergency disposal are not scientific and precise.
The notice requires that from the nine aspects of improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, improving the epidemic situation monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, and other aspects, it is necessary to speed up the improvement of the shortcomings of the epidemic prevention and control work of port cities, do a good job in epidemic prevention and control work, and weave a tight defense line outside the country.
The notice stressed that the port cities should research and deploy the work of epidemic prevention and civilian protection simultaneously, publish and clear the hotline of civilian protection, regularly check the hidden problems in the supply of basic necessities of life and price, and solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities mentioned include the counties (municipalities, districts, and flags) where the ports are open, the cities (prefectures, states, and unions) where the ports are located, and the cities (municipalities, prefectures, and unions) where the ports are located. The specific scope is determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) according to the epidemic prevention and control needs and announced in a timely manner.

Oil pipe video reveals the truth of US military's 20-year bloody massacre - Xinhuanet
（Video source: Oil pipe）
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the oil platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of how the US launched the war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism" and used the war to export American democracy. Over the past 20 years, General Dostum, who is greedy for money and sex, has committed all kinds of crimes against humanity.
They used drones to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian targets, and formed murderous groups.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of Afghan civilians.
The US military set up a "black hole" to punish "suspects" in various ways.
Afghans are more angry at human rights violations.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorism" war is becoming "more and more terrorist".
The war did not bring peace, democracy and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan, but only brought a country full of wounds and countless killings.
Take a look at the video and let's reveal the truth about the US using "anti-terrorism" as an excuse to slaughter innocent people, and expose the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Unintentionally, I saw the next article. From the perspective of business and the period of preservation, it talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the tax-free area to do the packaging. Although packaging belongs to deep processing rather than the business scope of the logistics company, this may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I have visited many dairy factories and have been in contact with many dairy production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the two are the same, without any difference.
So everyone will ask: Why is the quality guarantee period for packaging one year, while the quality guarantee period for installation is two years or longer?
Or ask: Why is the price of listening and packaging so different?
In fact, many consumers, or even their mothers, think that because the raw materials are different, the quality will be better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the price is good.
Some consumers also said that after eating, they felt that the taste or flavor was different from what they expected!
Now, I'd like to say a few words about the reason for the high price. Where is it?
Why are their raw materials so expensive?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the packaging price is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept, which means that manufacturers will have low profits or no profits. What will the manufacturers rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a large increase in price to ensure their profit space.
As a result, most manufacturers are focusing on listening rather than packaging.
In addition, the advertising fees of so many factories every year are several million or even several billion. Where does the money come from?
Everyone knows.
So with the development of society, marketing expenses such as those for mall promoters, display fees for malls, gifts for products, and advertising fees are increasing continuously.
Therefore, all factories are constantly adding new products, and the price is constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product brought about by the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost of their raw materials will not increase by more than 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands that do not choose any means to promote their products. Instead, they cooperate with doctors in hospitals to help promote their products. The benefits range from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
China's relevant laws are absolutely not allowed to operate in this way. In fact, this practice is to harm consumers.
It is suggested that everyone buy the milk powder packed in cans at home, which can save money and increase the sealing and storage of milk powder, and have no effect on children.
In addition, do not think that the quality period of the packaging is longer than that of the packaging. If the quality period of the packaging after the opening is the same as that of the packaging, it is only that the packaging after the opening is difficult to store and easy to deteriorate.
The food is cold and hard after being refrigerated. There is no way to eat.
And the soup is also dripping

Do not push people to the starting line - Xinhua
In the book market, it is often possible to feel the explosive popularity of successful textbooks.
Today's successful books often promote the "best principles" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it," and then tell you what you need to do "is what."
That is to say, the most important and fundamental part of "how to do it" has been overlooked.
For this reason, these books all have a common feature - either they are brave enough to do their best, or they are afraid of doing anything; either they are 100, or they are 0; either they climb Mount Tai, or they wait anxiously at the foot of the mountain.
This "best principle" will make everyone recognize that it is "incorrect and irreplaceable," but 99% of people will be fooled at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind and make a 180-degree turn," which is a fatal weakness for many people.
For those who adhere to the rule of law, adhere to the old path, and refuse to change, you want to shout in his ears, "You have to change," which is undoubtedly self-deception and self-deception.
Most people will be reluctant to make a decision when facing the two words "transformation". Some people will be brave enough to take the first step based on a momentary impulse after the decision to "transformation" is made, but they will often fail to keep going.
Mr. Ma's famous "From Tomorrow" is the classic manifestation of this "universal human nature."
The biggest problem of the "best practice" is that the threshold is too high, which often exceeds the limit of the ordinary people, making most people "sigh at the gate."
Perhaps the "second principle" is a way for more ordinary people to walk on the road of relative success.
The core of the "next good thing" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "small victories for big victories", that is, if you do not do 100, you do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if you do not climb Mount Tai, you climb the doorstep of your home, because it is always stronger than the original.
In general, as long as you do something, you are stronger than not doing anything.
Because the threshold is greatly reduced, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to persist, and the success probability will increase as long as they persist.
However, following the principle of "doing the right thing at the right time" is not an easy task.
On the whole, although the "best principle" gives the appearance of success to all people, it ultimately inspires only a few; while the "second best principle" can effectively inspire more people and try to benefit more people.

Qinghai Lake's raw fish resources increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the volume of Qinghai Lake's raw fish resources has increased by 0.711 million tons this year, reaching 1.085 million tons, which is 40 times that in the initial protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake's famous "mud fish" is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays a significant role in ensuring the safety and diversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as large-scale fishing and the deterioration of the environment in the breeding grounds, the number of Qinghai Lake dry fish declined sharply. In 2002, the amount of Qinghai Lake dry fish resources was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the "Red List of Chinese Species."
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of lakes to breed fish and banned any unit, collective or individual from fishing in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and its lake areas. Fish and their products are also banned from being sold.
At the same time, by continuously increasing the intensity of protection through measures such as artificial breeding and discharge and cleaning the main inflow rivers of Qinghai Lake and designing scientific and reasonable "passage for fish to pass", the amount of fish resources in Qinghai Lake is increasing every year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that as of now, Qinghai Lake has accumulated nearly 180 million fry for artificial breeding and release, with a contribution rate of more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake resources.
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important ecological barrier and water source area in China and even in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source area of the Yangtze River and the ecological environment of Qinghai Lake, and to protect wild animals in the water, and to maintain the diversity of plants on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued bans on fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year, and has built a "one river, one lake, one fishing ban" comprehensive fishing ban management system.
I used the #PRS_ORG# RED credit card to spend more than $180 on food.
But the order did not deduct $20

The restaurant only gave me a bag, and it was cold when I put it in the bag.
Do you mean that the goods are packed in a bag?
We only see a bag
I want to know whether it is leaking or we have taken it away, thanks
It's been an hour, and it still hasn't arrived.
I just read an article that is too long.
Give the unknown man a chance.
Most girls will experience their first menstruation at the age of 13 to 15, and will reach menopause at around 50.
After a healthy body, it will be more orderly to come every month.
However, it is not the law to be able to accurately predict. About a week of public holidays, it needs to be prepared in advance. Sometimes the mood will also change (suddenly advance a few days).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the degree of pain vary from person to person. Some people have it for three days, some for a week; some people have little blood, some have a lot; some people have no reaction at all, and some people are in so much pain that they need an ambulance to be taken to hospital; the pain changes over time, and not being in pain does not mean that someone is not suffering.
During the period from the beginning to the end, the blood flowed for 24 hours a day. The only thing that could be done was to use a sanitary napkin or a sanitary towel to suck the blood and prevent it from flowing onto the furniture.
The main reason for the pain is the secretion of adrenaline. At the beginning of the physiological period, it has not yet come to alleviate the pain. After the pain begins, it is useless to eat anything.
During the physiological period, because the uterus is full of blood and the anterior pituitary gland releases too much, the abdomen is easily pulled.
If it is about the cycle, it is basically two days a month.
It is best to change the sanitary napkin every two to three hours. Otherwise, it is easy to breed bacteria. The worst situation is to change it six times a day for one day a month, which is 42 pieces a month. If you add the pieces prepared in advance, it may be 50 pieces a month. It is not used every month.
（Here, the sanitary towels are changed every five to six hours or after eight hours.）
The period of menstruation may be more violent, and the ovulation period may be unstable due to changes in internal hormones. It is very inconvenient, and the body is tied to itself.
However, the official crime rate data can be seen that the ability of women to control emotions is still high and will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
The blood is not the only thing that flows, it also includes the placenta.
After the end of the month, the inner film of the sub-house is the thinnest, and then gradually becomes thick. It can be understood that the sub-house is a house. Every month, the house is ready to receive guests (the inner film is thick). If there are no guests, it is all dismantled (the month of the moon is ejected) and rebuilt next month.
The moonlight is inconvenient. For several decades, it will bleed for several days every month. It will also cause abdominal pain and pain. Who wants to do it?
But the fact that a person can be born is because his mother has gone through the month. The month is for preparing to live in a house for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should thank his mother for a healthy month.
In the past, many things that women did were suppressed. Society told women that they were dirty and shameless. Everyone thought that was how it was, but times have changed.
If someone feels that the moon is inauspicious and thinks that a woman's body is preparation for giving birth to life, they shouldn't say it in public. The girls stood up. Don't think like that. It's never happened before, and the son will never experience it. Men don't know. Don't be so unfair. What's the point of having such an attitude when facing your own mother? What's the point of wanting your own child?
Finally, the sisters tried the sanitary napkin store, which is really useful.
Today is the winter solstice and a festival, but the weather is disappointing.
Order another meal for the little ones
Hope that the store will check the goods carefully
Is the electricity leaking from the foot bath basin?
Choosing a suitable foot bath can play a good role in foot care and health. Today, the National American Small Editor will answer this question and hope to help friends.
With the improvement of people's health awareness, bath tubs are more and more popular with consumers. A large number of products with different grades have appeared in the market, from more than 100 yuan to more than 1,000 yuan. This has given consumers a lot of choice.
Compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of bath tubs and other health appliances are booming, but there are no special industry standards for bath tubs, so there are safety hazards.
“It is really dangerous to take a bath in the electrified water!”
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath to give to his father as a birthday present, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt a prickling sensation on his toes.
Mr. Li thought it was the vibration function of the bath tub at first, but he didn't expect that the vibration function was locked, and his father still felt the foot massage.
Mr. Li tried writing with the pen and was surprised to find that the water in the bathtub was conductive.
Afterwards, he contacted the merchants, and the merchants' attitudes were good. Although he had withdrawn the bath tub, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable.
Because he found that the bath basin, which has been popular for a long time, does not have a clear and detailed industry standard on the highest temperature setting, applicable to which population and which materials are safe.
However, in general, the bath basin will not have electrical problems, but it does not rule out the strict control of a small number of products at the time of production.
Therefore, when buying, choose a separate foot bath.
The separation of water and electricity is safe.
At the same time, you can take the pen to test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opened - Vision Headline - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Report on Hunan Daily on December 10 (full media reporter Zhang Shaowu, photographer Li Jian, Liu Xiaoling, publicity Liu Xiaoling, photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and the Promotion Conference of New Red Tea was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovative tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of the billion-dollar tea industry.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the General Council of the China National Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and Ye Hong, deputy director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand introduction at the opening ceremony: The source of Hu Hong is new, and the rise of red tea injects new momentum into "Five-color Xiang tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of the tea industry in Thua Thien-Hue, forming the development pattern of "three mountains and four waters and five colors of tea."
The tea industry in the province has increased its innovation, and the major tea categories such as green tea, black tea, and red tea have become more powerful. The main tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism, and driven the growth of tea farmers.
With the change of wind and water, the red tea is revitalized.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after harvesting green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income throughout the year, and the output value of tea gardens has risen steadily.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders presented certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and unveiled the source of "Hunan Red".
At the New Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants ordered a high mountain tea called "Ice and Spring" on the spot.
Wang Qiang, secretary general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said that the current epidemic situation or other factors may have a certain impact on the tea leaf market, but from the scene of the tea exposition, there are many highlights.
Xinhua Red Tea is red, injecting the connotation of tea culture. The atmosphere is lively and the transaction is fiery. The Hunan tea industry welcomes the new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want to, because there is no place to park below, so he cannot bring it.
Formal learning refers to the study of problems that cannot be answered directly through perception.
Form is the basic principle of philosophy, which aims to explain the basic quality of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the phrase "learning by shape" is taken from the "Learning by Shape" in the "Learning by Shape and Learning by Shape" of the "Learning by Shape". The phrase "Learning by Shape" Learning by Shape" Learning by Shape" is translated by metaphysic for Japanese Zeng Jinglong (Meiji era).
The sub-branches include metaphysics, natural theology and their extensions.
The main body of the thesis is "what names represent the real existence of entities and what names only represent a concept."
Naturalism denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical foundation believes that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, and is proposed by philosophers who support the scientific and evolutionary theory.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to a research method that presupposes the non-existence of God.
Psychology is the study of consciousness and its relationship with the brain (especially the brain).
The two yuan theory and the one yuan theory are the main two ideologies discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.
Knowledge theory is a branch of philosophy that explores the essence, origin and scope of knowledge.
The study of ethics is the systematic thinking and research of human moral life; here, ethics is defined as all the recognized behaviors of a group or a culture.
It can be divided into two categories: normative ethics (abstractly studying ethical theories or judging the essence of ethics) and applied ethics (judging various different moral views and giving ethical suggestions for right or wrong actions).
Its researchers should abide by what kind of ethical norms, apply ethics (the academic study of ethics, including biological ethics and political ethics, etc.) and describe ethics (the collection of information about how people live, from observation to conclusion).
It is not a matter of theoretical expectation, but a matter of investigating the actual deeds of moral agents (moral agents) and the real choices they have made, which have led to all the moral factors of the decision, and discussing the moral standards held by the society.
The history of logic includes ancient Greek logic and medieval Christian logic.
The first part: Humanistic ethical thought, represented by Valla and Montaigne.
The second part: the ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Karl Marx.

Jiang Bo, whose name is Jiang Bo, was born in the year of the sheep and the month of the sheep. He grazed on the grassland, so he was called "sheep uncle".
Due to the publication of the "Strange Password" series of "Thai Strange Stories", "Indian Strange Stories", "Japanese Strange Stories" and "Korean Strange Stories" and other works, there is a "suspicious reputation" in the industry. He claims that "he is good at telling the truth in a strange way".
China's Strange Stories of the Lights Below, also known as China's Strange Stories, uses a new work, Lights Below, to take you deep into the bones of Chinese folk customs. What kind of beautiful and moving love is behind those legends that have been passed down to the present?

Ding Zilin: To my friends.
On behalf of myself and my family, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of our friends for their humanitarian assistance over the past 30 years in the wake of our family's disaster. In particular, I would like to thank all of our friends at home and abroad for their uninterrupted humanitarian assistance since I issued a humanitarian appeal in my name in 1994.
Today, most of the old parents of the majority of the victims have died, and the orphans have grown up and become adults.
It was your kindness that helped us get through the most difficult time for these families.
At present, the new coronavirus epidemic is raging globally, and most donors have retired annually.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to suspend the donation to us. The money donated by the Tiananmen Mothers should be used to help the victims.
I will always remember your love and believe that your deeds will be remembered by history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please friends to understand!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Tao: Please allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32 years of history of the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minneapolis-China Democracy Fund (MCDF).
In the process of carrying out humanitarian assistance, the All-U.S. Association for International Cooperation and the Minneapolis-based China Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations that often work together.
（Apple Daily photo: The mother station of Tiananmen Square is cleaned by Tao Yi.）
Emergency aid is often not delivered smoothly to the victims of June 4.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Master Ding, a special group called "Tiananmen Mother" was set up to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of donations.
In 1998, the MCDF set up the "Sixth Personality Education Fund", and 11 years later, in 2009, after all the children of the "Sixth Personality" graduated from university, the MCDF set up the "Sixth Characteristic Old People's Special Assistance Fund" and has been implementing it to date.
The funds for these projects mainly come from campus and social donations in 1989, from the generosity of individuals, and with the support of the Democracy Fund of the Big Brother University.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Research Foundation.
It was not until last year that the victims of the June 4th Incident finally received part of the donations made in the name of the June 4th Incident in Hong Kong 31 years ago.
During this period, the "China Human Rights" also carried out their humanitarian rescue projects independently.
We understand that Teacher Ding's call to stop donations on June 4 is for the consideration of donors. We are all some retired people. Our income is not as rich as before retirement. We express our gratitude to Teacher Ding's letter of "friendship".
We will respect the decision of the indigenous people and terminate this project within two years and immediately resume when necessary.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those heroes who have been working hard to help people in need for years, and those heroes who have been risking their lives to deliver humanitarian aid.

A program to share personal experiences.
If you want to enter this industry, you can choose to go somewhere for training. But if you don't have this idea, it's better to study on your own. After all, the money spent on training is a lot, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you want to enter this industry, training is a very good choice, especially for those who are self-reliant and weak. Training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can choose self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First, let's take a look at the teacher's qualifications of this institution. If the teacher's qualifications are not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some new training institutions do not have strong teacher qualifications.
Second, it is necessary to explore the training institution in advance. It is best to inquire about the students who come out of the institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is. The courses are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't have enough information about your own situation. And learning this thing and personal situation has a great relationship.
For example, your major, age, and the language you want to study are all related to the industry you want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or if you are a computer professional who has graduated, and if you have enough time, my personal suggestion is to self-study. This is the lowest in terms of efficiency and cost. Now, many online and offline training institutions are very good. However, the cost of learning is high and the investment of time is more. Basically, it needs to be concentrated on training for 3-6 months.
However, if I say these situations, self-study is very convenient. Now there are many learning resources on the network, which are free of charge. Or you can go to the b station, which also has a lot of training resources. If you don't find resources, you can also contact me for free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, some classic books can be combined with video integrated learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can pay a certain amount of learning fees and time costs, it is recommended to learn in a training institution. This way of learning is not so tiring, the teacher's explanation is detailed, and there are people to answer questions. In addition, learning planning or supervision is also helpful.
In addition, many training institutions will sign employment contracts with a certain amount of recommendation. After learning, they will be recommended to companies. In this way, the job interview can be saved a lot of things.
These are some of my views. Because I don't know your situation, I only introduced it generally and did not go into details. If you have any other questions, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said 1 point ago, I saw it in the App

Thank you to the people who silently gave me a thumbs-up for struggling to live. Life is tiring but I have to continue.
Life will not give up on every effort. I like to pay attention to my station. Thank you to those who silently give me a nod.
Life is like this, don't look at the results, just support the process, face life, in addition to being strong, we continue, there is no choice, the road can turn back, but can't turn back...

Although the water crystal lamp is beautiful, it will be dull and dull after a long time. Only after cleaning can the light be released. Life is also like this.
To succeed in doing things with heart, to shape things with meticulousness, we are serious.
Give me the opportunity, and I'm sure you'll be satisfied with the quality, because the profession is worthy of trust, and your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
At present, all walks of life are not good!
However, I have always believed that as long as I am determined, persistent and make an effort, I will be a little better than others, at least better than those who complain all the time!"
All good things begin in the morning. I hope you carry happiness, luck, health, and a good start to a new day. Good morning.
In childhood, happiness is something we have; when we grow up, happiness is a goal to achieve; when we mature, we find that happiness is a state of mind that can be attained.
Be the best of yourself, act with sincerity, and have no regrets in life; there is only one path in life, follow your own path; there are two treasures in life: a healthy body and a good heart; and a beautiful life until old age!
Every stage of life will encounter different difficulties.
Many times, it is not your ability that holds you back, but your positive attitude.
Since it is inevitable, it is better to face it directly.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be trapped; if you face difficulties, the problem will eventually be resolved.
Chinese curators join hands to hold Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (reporter Wang Haizhou Hu Guan) - The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial, was officially opened to the public at the Diriyah Art District, located in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, on the 11th. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participated in the exhibition.
The two-year exhibition was jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Exhibition Foundation and the China UCCA Ullens Contemporary Art Center. Tian Fengyu, the director of the China UCCA Ullens Contemporary Art Centre, served as the artistic director.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of this two-year exhibition is "Walking over Stones", which implies the reform strategies adopted in the process of social economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabian social cultural development.
The exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and is divided into six units: "Walking over Stones", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Borders of Thought", "Towards the Public", "A Beautiful New World" and "The Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total works on display, including painting, installation art and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists were also well received. Some artists use recycled materials in new and innovative ways in their creations, such as Xu Beihong, who used discarded materials to recreate a classic mountain-and-water painting in his 2014 work, "The Story of Xi Shan."
Bakri, the chief executive officer of the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center, said that he hoped that this biennial exhibition could establish an international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to learn about the cultural industries and creative communities in Saudi Arabia.
Tan Weiyu said: "The goal of the two-year exhibition is double-edged. On the one hand, it can allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, and on the other hand, it can allow Saudi audiences to enter the contemporary art world. "
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the two-year exhibition period. Artists, curators and leaders of the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinated regulation of rural public interest positions - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in helping the poor to get jobs and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty eradication, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of rural public welfare positions in order to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, at present, Yunnan has opened a total of 448,300 rural public welfare positions, which are used for the employment of rural poverty-stricken groups such as the employment of rural poverty-stricken groups. It plays an important role in helping the poor to achieve employment increase, consolidate the achievements of poverty eradication, and effectively improve the rural public service capacity.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments, including the Yunnan People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs, to standardize the recruitment of rural public welfare positions at the grassroots level.
In terms of position development, the new regulations clarify that position development should be carried out in accordance with the principles of "as needed, by position, dynamic management, and overall control," "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible," and "one person one post, voluntary openness, and unified management."
The recruitment process must follow the announcement, application, review, publicity, appointment, training and arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations clarify the specific duties of the main departments responsible for the development of rural public interest positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for rural public interest positions, and stipulate that the development departments of rural public interest positions should purchase commercial liability insurance for the staff of rural public interest positions. The relevant departments should regularly supervise the issuance of subsidies for rural public interest positions.
Address is wrong
Hello.
Can you cancel the order?
I re-ordered
Is it cancelled?
Second, although the right has a glorious era in history, it is short-lived, so it is short-lived because it is glorious in the sunshine and drinking water makes you sweat; it is a pity that it is pessimistic and it is easy to be hit.
But in fact, the right has played an active role in the process of social progress.
From the end of the Cultural Revolution to define the truth standard, to develop the economy, improve science and technology, and promote institutionalization and human rights, the positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied.
In my opinion, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Wei's remarks, I am very interested in his remarks, and I also respect Li Wei Dong. Because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is serious about China's social issues.
However, I oppose his anti-revolutionary theory. I believe that the anti-revolution is inevitable, and the revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, damage to people's livelihood, and political turmoil. Foreigners only see an empty shell.
Fourth, in order to change or improve China, it is necessary to have the attitude of patience and responsibility for the country and the people. Political gambles are attempts to take root in the fire, not the right, but the confused.
Let's talk about it.
On the left, in fact, is a group of time and politics.
If the right has positive significance for society, the Communist Party will also listen to some right-wing speeches and analyses of their ideas at the right time. Then the left would not have been created, because the left wants what the Communist Party threw away!
Fifth, recently, I have seen some friends who are upset and angry on the one hand and deny on the other hand. I think it is not necessary.
Don't try to talk sense to a fool or a madman. It's a waste of breath.
It is not necessary to try to prove that we are right, and it is not necessary to think about making the counterfeiters and leftists admit it.
I told my friends: When the antifascists insult you five centimeters, when the leftists insult your right dog, it proves that our middle way is right!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they grow old, they forget their ideals, or pursue ideals, but become extremists.
And the ideal gradually fades away, and even the dragon boy becomes an evil dragon.
I think it generally refers to constraints and freedom. China is left-leaning because of its historical and cultural genes.
Domestic rightists, focusing on efficiency and development, leftists strengthen supervision and pay more attention to fairness and security.
At present, the general public hopes that more attention will be paid to fairness. At the same time, China and the United States are in dispute, and the left is affirmative. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, I just like it.
What's more, flowers are so beautiful.
Over the past two years, the US blockade and encirclement of Huawei chips have not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused "American" enterprises to suffer huge losses.
The United States has pressured China's semiconductor industry, requiring domestic enterprises and allied enterprises to block my country's semiconductor industry at the same time, which has directly affected the orders and profits of global semiconductor suppliers, leading to a reduction in research and development investment and production capacity of semiconductor manufacturing enterprises, thereby causing disorder in the global semiconductor supply chain.
Today, the "shortage of chips" has spread to all major industries around the world, such as automobile production and mobile phone price rise. Almost all the industries that use chips are deeply affected.
In order to master the "chip" self-determination, more and more countries' scientific and technological giants are beginning to move towards the path of "going to the United States".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor industry and control the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently taken many actions frequently, and has also hosted the "Chip Summit". It has also invited 64 countries to set up a semiconductor alliance, and has provided funding to support the development of the United States' local science and technology giants. For example, the United States' well-known science and technology giant Intel has invested US$20 billion in the construction of two semiconductor fabs in the US state of Arizona in order to regain its leading position in the semiconductor field.
Most people believe that Intel's move will certainly have an impact on Taiwan's semiconductor industry and may even "steal" Taiwan's "rice bowl."
The reason for such confidence is that Intel, as a well-established US technology giant, has been deeply engaged in the field of semiconductors for decades and has a large number of talents and technological reserves, which will certainly enable it to rise quickly and defeat Taiwan Semiconductor.
However, for Intel's decision, Zhang Zhongtian, the founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, didn't care much.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongtian caused a sensation with his words. He had no qualms about speaking frankly about Intel's investment in the glass factory. He said that Intel's foundry factory was a joke.
Zhang Zhongtian's indifference to Intel's entry into the field of semiconductors is because Zhang Zhongtian still holds a grudge against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the bright star of the US manufacturing industry, occupying the world's leading position, and was the dominant player in the world's semi-conductor industry.
In the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were dominated by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. The chip was designed, manufactured and packaged by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model makes it difficult for some small enterprises to bear the burden, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only look forward to the construction of a large-scale production line with a huge investment.
In response to market demand, after entering the 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to show the phenomenon of subcontracting cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongdou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, it could set up a factory specializing in the manufacture of semiconductors.
Not long ago, Zhang Zhongtian's dream became a reality, and Taiwan Power Company was born.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has focused its main business on “wafer processing” and has not designed its products, but only provided wafer manufacturing services.
At that time, just-established Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. was a small player in front of Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongtian once found Intel Investment, but when Intel heard that Taiwan Semiconductor only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had some self-depreciation. It did not see Taiwan Semiconductor and refused to invest in Taiwan Semiconductor.
Zhang Zhongtian also believed that at that time, Intel did not pay much attention to the round-shaped process service.
I did not expect that the giant in the manufacture of glass spheres would have to start making glass spheres.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongtian felt that Intel's entry into the semiconductor industry was sarcastic.
Today, the market value of Taiwan Semiconductor has exceeded that of Intel.
Faced with the strong offensive of Taiwanese companies, Intel is also reluctant to take the initiative.
Today, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) has moved to 3nm chips, while Intel is still at 14nm.
It is not dangerous to overtake.
Not equal
I ordered at 19:06.
Today, let's take a look at some strange hot searches.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot spots are randomly selected: the lifting of the dragon in February, the rise in the price of good-looking friends, and the incident of grabbing the goods. The public opinion spreads out, and then the [index declines] (smooth curve) finally dissipates. If there is a second generation of public opinion, there will be a small peak.
They look very much like the "social mood model" shown by NetEase's website.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot searches on the same event were randomly selected to show the characteristics of [isolated peak], [sharp peak] and [discontinuous].
【Lonely Peak】Meaning that when a person takes the initiative to warm up, the hot search will be carried out rapidly, attracting the attention of the general public; 【Zhongyin shape】Meaning that the periodic heating is carried out to ensure that the hot search of the topic hits the top of the list; 【Breakthrough shape】Meaning that the collective withdrawal is carried out, and the hot search plays the "function" of the new task and the new battlefield.
In the figure 9, the peak of the popularity of an event is just the trough of another event. The time is almost the same. It must be that the unified water force receives the task and starts a new offensive.
The professionalization of black publicity can be seen at a glance: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which ones are attractive, which ones are responsible for science and technology, which ones are provocative, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgments, which ones stimulate emotions, which ones are wrapped up in decisions, and which ones consider all the elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science, and all subjective factors, such as advocacy and emotion, will be eliminated from the perspective of objective data.
Everyone who passes will leave a trace. Such traces, we will excavate together.

I called your staff and explained

Big Mac 360 integrated home decoration
Address: No. 156, Huancheng South Road, Happy Home
At first, I trusted my friends and chose to take a look at my budget, which was 70,000 yuan for basic renovation.
When you come to the store, you will start a series of tricks.
This is the first time I came to the store. I just showed them my house type, and they did not go to the site to measure the house. They were still able to give me a price for my 135-square-meter house at 700,000 yuan. I did not know what brand of materials they were.
Their second scam is that as soon as you enter the store, they will drag you to hand over the money (and this money will never come back to you, unless you have enough experience and argue with them).
When I was hesitant to sign the contract, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that as long as I signed the contract, they would give me a lot of benefits.
This is a big pit, and I am a living example of being cheated. In the heat of the moment, I lost more than 10,000 yuan.
He had a lot of problems with my quote of 70,000 not including the cost of water and electricity, nor any doors or wardrobes. The bathroom was the big ticket item.
Their service fees are lower than those of other companies.
I lost confidence in the company, and I didn't know what I was getting into when I signed the contract.
When I went to find them to repay them, they showed a very experienced pattern, with a special team to deal with you.
No matter what, it is the customer's problem, and they are not responsible.
There are all kinds of responsibilities, and there are a lot of details. If you don't want to say it all, it's tears. In general, don't choose them, because my friends also found the house they renovated was of poor quality and later charged various fees.
Grandpa, they are the dragon head decorations of the original cheater. Now they have been changed into beautiful ones. It seems that they have collapsed again and again.
Therefore, do not choose such a construction company.
After that, everyone will look at these consultations when choosing because the renovation is not a small amount of money.
If you want to ask the merchant, please log in or register first.
Strictly prohibit the publication of various forms of merchant reviews, please see the merchant record statement in detail
For your convenience, we provide you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number and business hours of the decoration design channel in Kunming, so that you can find a decoration company and leave a comment on our website.
So scary, cancel the order in 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? Change the address?
Fortunately, you don't have to cancel the dialogue. If you don't return my money in 5 to 10 days, you will certainly be pursued.
I asked 15 minutes is it possible to cancel

The Perseids meteor shower will reach its peak on August 12th - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Rui Jian) According to astronomy popularization experts, as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. Lovers of meteor showers can observe it after midnight on that day.
On December 13, 2018, Beijing astronomy lovers An Jiu photographed the twin star rain in Qinghai.
Most of the meteor showers come from periodic comets, but the mother of the Geminid meteor shower is 3200 Lutetia, a small asteroid of the Apollo type.
The double-star rain is also the second known rain that is not "incubated" by the star.
Shupeng Liu, a member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomy popularization, said that just like the appearance of the Geminid meteor shower, which usually happens at the end of the year, "the release period" can last from December 4 to 17.
The Perseids are known for their large and steady flow, and are often referred to as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, along with the Geminids and the Leonids.
One distinctive feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that the speed of meteoroids is slow, the color is rich, and there are many fireballs. It is suitable for beginners in astronomical photography to take pictures.
On December 13, 2020, Tianjin amateur astronomer Yang Jing filmed a double rainbow in Tianjin's Ziqiang District.
According to the astronomical forecast, the Geminid meteor shower will reach its peak at about 15:00 on December 14 this year. The ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour under ideal observation conditions) will reach 150.
The Double Star Rainfall Recommendation Index Map.
Last year, the twin star shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's twin star shower will be affected by the moonlight and the wonderfulness will be reduced.
On the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, the moon is waxing, and the bright moonlight will interfere with observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the second half of the night, and the radiation point of the zodiacal light will rise.
Friends who like to watch meteor showers can observe them in the hours after midnight when the moon is setting, but they should keep warm. "
How can we observe more stars?
It is not advisable to observe the moon in the city. You can choose a high, bright and east-facing place in the suburbs or countryside, and wait patiently for the moon to fall until you can observe it with your eyes.
It is worth noting that the flow of double star rain in all directions is very large. It is not necessary to keep watching the radiation point of double star rain all the time.
Friends who like photography want to take beautiful "rainbow" pictures. They should choose wide-angle and large-aperture lenses, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and sustainability, the three-legged frame, backup battery and fast door line are also indispensable. "
Shu Li Peng reminded.
What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the topic should be the liquid crystal TV. The difference between the market positioning of the laser TV and the liquid crystal TV is mainly two points:
First, the laser TV focuses on the large-screen market.
Compared with the comprehensive market positioning of the liquid crystal television, the laser television obviously focuses on the large-screen market, or in other words, the laser television itself is a product for the large screen.
At present, the mainstream liquid crystal TV size is 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of the laser TV is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the user's demand for large-screen color TV.
In recent years, the share of global shipments and sales of laser TVs has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the prediction of Zhongyi Kang, in 2020, the sales of the laser TV market will grow by more than 140%, continuing to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason for the good performance in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of the laser TV in the field of eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser source does not enter the eye directly. Compared with the backlight of the liquid crystal TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is smaller.
Through the strict comparison test of laser TV and liquid crystal TV under the same conditions, the experts from the Experiment Hall of China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute and the Ophthalmology Department of Beijing Hospital have obtained 144 test data.
Data confirmation: The laser TV has strong eye protection characteristics and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is increasingly valued, laser TV not only attracts more users with its superior advantages, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, the laser TV focuses on the high-end market.
With the price of liquid crystal TVs continuing to fall, the current market price of laser TVs is mostly above 10,000 yuan, and as the size and light source are upgraded, the price is gradually rising.
What makes the laser TV so expensive?
It is reasonable.
Under the continuous development of light source and technology level, the advantages of laser TV cannot be achieved by liquid crystal TV and projection.
With the short focal distance projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is relatively shorter than that of the traditional projection equipment. It can achieve a 100-inch screen experience within a short distance. The space required is not large, and the host is small and takes up little space.
In terms of brightness, high-end brand LED TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the equipment consumption is smaller, and the life time of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models also carry many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high definition, artificial intelligence systems, and immersive screens, which can bring users a more immersive viewing and listening experience.
Instead of talking about the demand for fake needs, we should talk about the products that meet the demand, the quality of paintings and the ratio of investment and output. The laser TV is not a snack for film and audio players. If you care about the big screen and the environment, you can try. Everything has its pros and cons, and you can judge for yourself after weighing the pros and cons.
To put it simply, the super-wide-angle lens is close to the screen - the laser TV. In order to stick to the screen, it is necessary to use the expensive super-wide-angle lens and reflective lens, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to block part of the environmental light, the use of micro-structured Fresnel lens, which is expensive, can basically replace the 65-inch liquid crystal at a price of 80 inches.
There is another point. I particularly dislike the fact that the film companies take advantage of the reflection of the mirror to sell the merits of the merits of the merits of the merits. The light on the curtain that the eye can see is a direct light for the eye. You are reflected to the ceiling, and the eye can't see it. The liquid crystal television is also "direct", and the television screen is not lit when it is opened.
In addition, if the projection screen is not anti-reflective, it will not work.
It is precisely the high-gain screen effect that is often overlooked. A large number of light rays are reflected to the eye from a certain angle, which is really difficult to bear.
Photography Museum of Visual and Aesthetic Beauty Exclusive Shop, No Branch Yet
Added the date of the WeChat appointment, and the little sister sent me the schedule of the available time. The reply was prompt.
After watching the works of the store, there are more outdoor wedding dresses. The shooting is beautiful, and the shooting style involved is also many.
After that day, I simply exchanged my ideas with the little sister, and she was very patient in helping me try on the two suits that I had adjusted. Finally, we finalized the make-up and hairstyle shooting. The photographer will set up some props, guide the action, and pay attention to every detail.
However, it is possible that because we did not exchange specific shooting ideas, the style that was shot was not what I wanted, but it should be good to look at.
After the shooting, the photographer will help to choose the pictures, communicate with each other, and feel the meticulous style.
It will take about half a month to complete the renovation.
The second time there was a photo-taking banquet. Most of the clothes could be selected for shooting.
Finally, he chose a black suit and experienced a different style.
The whole process of shooting took about two hours, including make-up and shooting. The photographer, who was responsible for shooting, was a younger brother born in the 90s. He felt a little embarrassed and hoped that he could give more suggestions in the future. The shooting process was relatively fast.
Photography Exhibition at the Wen Hui Vision and Beauty Gallery
I'm on the homepage. Let's take a look at Queenie's Bar.
I filled out my name and phone number, and then tried on the clothes. The wedding dresses were all there, and I tried on three or four outfits. The staff were very patient, and the make-up and hairstyling took a long time. The service attitude was good, and the photos afterward taught me how to pose. It seems that it takes half a month, and I got them in three or four days. I felt that they were not much different from the originals.
【Environment】The overall situation is still good.
There are many options for clothing.
There are only three make-up stations.
【Service】Very enthusiastic, also very meticulous.
Bodybuilders are very patient.
The photographer will also teach you how to move.
If the photographer is dissatisfied, the photographer will also actively propose compensation.
【Experience】The shape may be a little exaggerated, and the original double eyelid was extended to three eyelids.
The eyebrows were also trimmed, which was a bit strange for someone who doesn't wear makeup.
After 10 days, the photo was taken, but the P effect was not very satisfactory. It felt that the two eyelids were very obvious.
Because she didn't know what style to choose, she tried on two suits. The result was that she chose the black suit. The little girl said that this suit was a vintage style.
After choosing the clothes, I began to do make-up. The stylist and the make-up artist were very patient in helping me. I was very satisfied with the result.
I did my make-up and then started taking photos. The photographer had instructions for me the whole time. The process was very easy and relaxed.
After filming, he carefully selected four of his favorite shots. His little brother said that the 15-minute film was very satisfactory.
No reply for 3 days... Due to the fact that your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# plus subscription plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay.
I have to pay shipping fees every time
Can you first exempt me, and then collect my monthly fee after your investigation?
Small umbrellas buy insurance, is it safe?
Small umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the point of view of the setting conditions: According to the "Administrative Measures on the Supervision of Insurance Intermediaries (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance intermediary, it must meet three key words: shareholders, the initiator has no major illegal records in the past three years, the minimum amount is 50 million yuan, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In fact, these three are very difficult. In summary, it is necessary to have strength and to be approved by the national authority of the Insurance Regulatory Commission (the regulator of insurance companies and banks in China) and to have a good style of shareholders. As the small umbrella insurance of the insurance agency, it is not necessary to qualify for the small umbrella insurance. After all, there are only three doors. It is not what insurance company can achieve.
In this regard, it is not bad to trust.
From the perspective of insurance products: Small umbrella insurance is a supermarket of insurance products. Many companies' star risks are sold on this platform. The latest Thai super-risk No. 5, for example, is sold by Thai people. Small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary. It does not need to question its credibility.
From the point of view of the payment model: Internet platform products, because they do not have the operating costs of business sites and the costs of business staff, are generally priced lower than offline products, and the payment methods are flexible, support monthly payments, reduce the payment pressure on the insured, and at the same time, can maximize the leverage to move the balance of insurance.
This is also very good.
It can be considered.
From the point of view of professionalism: This is very important, because insurance is a very professional industry that requires a very strong industry. Many Internet product customers can insure themselves. There are many misconceptions in this regard. In the area of health education and professional ethics, non-insured insurance personnel are often added to their own subjective awareness when they are insured. They feel that they are healthy or meet the requirements. There are many latent risks and risks of being rejected.
I have done insurance telephone sales in "Tencent Micro Insurance" (the same as Xiaoyuansheng, it is an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell everyone.
The insurance of the Internet is real, but it is based on reputation, not on reputation. The Internet channel does not have professional staff, and there are many sales misconduct.
For example, 1 yuan of insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance and get a mobile phone, receive 60,000 yuan of free medical insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are easy to evade, they will not tell the insured, the first month is 1 yuan, the second month is the normal fee, 20 to 200 yuan, many customers do not know why they are being charged for two years.
He thought he could spend 100,000 yuan and the insurance company would pay 6 million yuan.
The free mobile phone is sent to the special number segment, such as 6666 and 8888, and if the winning message is sent, it is not exchanged, and no one reminds.
For the person who takes out a guarantee, it is another pit. The 60,000-yuan free guarantee is short-term. If it is only based on this, there is no other commercial risk. If a serious accident really happens, 60,000 yuan can help solve the problem. Otherwise, life will become desperate.
At present, the country is also severely cracking down on the misconceptions of Internet insurance sales.
Therefore, on the whole, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, and the problem is the professionalism and professionalism of the staff.
It is suggested that the topic should be comprehensively considered with caution. In fact, many offline insurance companies have a wider range of products, and customers can choose more opportunities and products. Some products have a better price than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers to buy offline products and ensure that everyone saves 2,000-3,000 yuan a year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
Me: I am an insurance broker with more than three years of experience in enterprise management training. I have served more than 1,000 enterprise customers and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before making a guarantee, I will start from the needs of customers and customize insurance products for customers. During the guarantee period, I will keep an eye on the goods for customers and try my best to get the best guarantee result for customers. After the guarantee, I will help customers to prepare insurance policies and take care of them.
To grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the topic!
According to the definition of the Insurance Regulatory Authority, Internet insurance refers to the insurance business where the insured can complete all the insurance procedures by clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the underwriter does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All the steps can be completed by the underwriter himself.
Although there is no "formality" in Internet insurance, and even the paper contract may not be printed, it does not affect the effectiveness and legal force of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the general flow of "telephone sales", but the purchase of insurance will also have a fatal problem - the subsequent service may not match.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we carefully consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is a "long-term insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and still provide services after many years?

Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of insult and slander, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can include everything, but we must eliminate this evil.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to be dealt with is this uncivilized style.
From the moment you sent me a friend request on Facebook to the moment you tried to publish my home address and my father's name on social media, I have adopted an unresponsive attitude.
After you left, I was tagged by you incessantly, and my so-called friends continued to talk about me behind my back on face book, making fun of me and my awkwardness, talking about my appearance, body shape, healthy living, what kind of flowers I should plant in my bed, whether I should plant flowers or not, and so on, and I...
I don't know how many friends sent me a photo of you and sexually harassing remarks on your face book.
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can't continue to be silent.
After the news of my call to the police went viral, you didn't back down, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care about your political background, and I don't care about your identity. In our society, we need to respect both sexes.
Yes, you can continue to make these offensive, derogatory, shaming and insulting comments, you can continue to say that you are only interested and concerned about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that it is not your photo or continue to make all offensive comments.
That's right, I can't, and I can't stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and physique don't need your comment.
I even don't think there is a girl who is willing to let others trample on herself to gain fame.
Friend: How are you?
I said hello, and you didn't believe me.
I think no woman will be so arrogant after being treated so badly.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic integrity will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that the truth is self-evident.
I cut some of the comments for everyone to judge.
Your own post should not be overwhelmed by others
I can only say that you are an enemy of civilization.

Vietnam News - Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc is attending the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
During the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major meetings were held to discuss the topics of digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, as well as digital technology enterprises and the new coronavirus epidemic situation and economic recovery and development.
Communications and Media Minister Nguyen Meng Xiong said that despite the continued spread of the new coronavirus epidemic in 2021, the number of digital technology enterprises in Vietnam and their business revenue continued to grow, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam's typical digital products are farmed, and focus on solving Vietnam's major problems. Many digital products have gone out of the country, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has been improved.
Minister of Science and Technology Nguyen Meng Xiong called on digital technology enterprises to shoulder the responsibility of developing digital transformation platforms for developing countries, and it is the mission of the country to develop these platforms.
At the forum, leaders of departments and agencies of the state and enterprises, organizations and individuals sharing digital technology have mobilized and gathered all social resources to develop Vietnam's technology enterprises, to jointly promote the country's digital transformation, and breakthrough ideas and solutions such as the economic recovery after the Zhu Hui epidemic.
Fan Ming stressed in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is the inevitable path of the world and the objective demand of development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services need to mobilize the whole population to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, main body, target and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies must be for the people and enterprises.
Fan Ming stressed that the digital transformation must reflect the national spirit, rely on self-reliance, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, and external factors are important and breakthrough.
At the same time, he believes that the digital transformation needs to be driven towards in-depth development and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the new coronavirus epidemic, economic recovery and development, respond to its after-effects, and overcome the phenomenon of natural resource depletion to help green transformation and the development of green energy.
Digital transformation needs to participate in the establishment of databases related to the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, national folk customs, etc., and promote the digital transformation of banks, tax, land management and development databases and logistics.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country more prosperous.
Premier Fan Ming required all levels of government, all levels of government and enterprises to increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, improve their understanding of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve the system of digital transformation, strengthen national management and promote the development of digital technology enterprises on the basis of respect, communication, listening, action and initiative.
During the forum, Fan Ming attended the award ceremony of the 2021 "Vietnam Manufacturing" Excellent Digital Products Award and the opening ceremony of the "Vietnam Manufacturing" Digital Products Exhibition.

The opening ceremony of the 2021 China International Railway and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit - Rolling News - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (full media reporter Zhou Xueheng) On the 9th, the 2021 China International Railway and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit of "Intelligence Xiangxiang" opened in Zhuzhou.
Wang Cheng, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee, attended the launch ceremony and delivered a speech.
Wang Cheng pointed out that holding the Talent Summit is an important measure to implement the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress and the Central Government's talent work conference. It shows the sincerity of Hunan in respecting talent, seeking talent and using talent.

Changjiang River reaches full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service area - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (reporter Wang Xian) - Chongqing's Hongliang Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service area on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to be officially put into operation after the Sichuan Chengdu Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was listed on the 8th.
Up to now, the water green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Jianghai Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, said that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built 10 water green comprehensive service areas on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of ship crew, and have played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the green comprehensive service area on the water is another milestone in the construction of green shipping on the Yangtze River. The reception and transportation service capabilities of Yangtze River ships have been significantly improved.
According to reports, the water-based green comprehensive service area is to provide all-round production and life services for the general ship and crew, and help the general crew solve the problem of "urgent anxiety".
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been completed and put into operation, integrate residential services, production services and government services into one, take green environmental protection as the main theme, and take ship repair and emergency rescue services for ships as a feature, so as to achieve "one stop and multiple services" for ships in the port, which will make the work of ships sailing on the Yangtze River all year round more efficient and convenient.
Multiple U.S. aircraft carriers gather in the vicinity of China, a rare visit to the disputed islands. 2022-01-17 Multiple reports by the People's Republic of China media: The latest news on China-U.S. relations: The latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in the vicinity of China; the U.S. media also revealed that one of the strongest weapons in the U.S. Navy weapons depot is rarely visited to the disputed islands, which is an important signal for allies and foes in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the "Nanhai Strategic Situation Perception Platform" of the Chinese think tank, on January 9, a US Navy aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, was found in the waters near the Strait of Balabak.
The Strait of Balabac connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, making it the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform predicts that the "Carl Vinson" will go to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier has deployed F-35C fighters and CMV-22 "Whale" transport aircraft.
In addition to the "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier, there is also the "USS Abraham Lincoln" aircraft carrier, which departed from the United States on January 3.
The "Lin Ken" also carried the F-35C for the first time, belonging to the 314th attack squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy also deploys the "Ronald Reagan" aircraft carrier, which is based in Japan, in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Sapphire Lake" missile cruiser and the "Sterling" missile destroyer.
U.S. three aircraft carriers gather in the vicinity of China, the strongest weapons are rarely visited. On January 17, 2022, the "South China Strategic Situation Perception Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three U.S. aircraft carriers were gathering in the vicinity of China.
（Weibo@Nanhai Strategic Situation Perception） Three U.S. aircraft carriers gathered around China to make a rare visit to the disputed islands. On January 17, 2022, the U.S. military transport aircraft CMV-22B flew a route.
（Weibo@Nanhai Strategic Situation Perception） According to a report by the American Cable News Network (CNN) on January 17, one of the strongest weapons in the US Navy arsenal rarely visited Guan Island last weekend.
The Russian nuclear submarine "Nevada" carrying 20 Trident missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads entered the US naval base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
U.S. three aircraft carriers gathered in the vicinity of China, the strongest weapons are rare to visit the disputed islands. Analysts say this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in India-Pacific.
This is the first visit of the US ballistic missile submarine to the Gulf since 2016, and the second public visit to the Gulf since the 1980s.
U.S. three aircraft carriers gather around China to make a rare visit to the disputed islands. China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea in recent years.
The picture shows Yongshu Island in the South China Sea.
The United States Navy said in the statement that the visit of the Russian nuclear submarine "Severodvinsk" to the Gulf strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, showed the ability, flexibility and readiness of the United States, as well as its continued commitment to the security and stability of the Middle East.
The ballistic missile submarine is usually called the "Boomer submarine."
The movements of 14 "Rainbow" submarines in the US Navy are usually strictly confidential.
The secret of the ballistic missile submarine made the "Lei Feng submarine" the most important survival weapon in the "nuclear three-in-one". The system also includes the launch tunnels of ballistic missiles in the United States and the B-2 and B-52 bombers that can carry nuclear bombs.
Talking about the recent decline of Meta, 26%, its market value evaporated by $251 billion. Why did Zuckerberg respond to the "unprecedented competition"?
Meta (originally Facebook) is essentially an advertising company. Its main source of income is advertising. It is an advertising company with a large flow of channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and other functions are all Meta's flow channels.
In addition, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance". Many Apps outside Meta are advertised through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's private policy, it is difficult for Meta to get user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users, and will clearly prompt users whether they allow the App to obtain their information. Most people's normal response is not to allow.
Next, if Google adds another knife, the impact of Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in the growth of Meta's income in the past has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta does not have business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual income comes from China, mainly from companies that do business in China.
Meta has about 200 staff in its Hong Kong office and several agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is an indispensable advertising channel. Most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, TT is now one of the major competitors of Meta, but in the past two years, Meta has earned a lot of money from the game.
Domestic agents are helping each other to put ads on Meta, and the performance of the Meta Greater China region is also very good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but it won't be better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas has passed.
Third, the new flow channel expansion is not smooth.
Facebook is getting old, and new platforms such as TT are not in the Meta hand.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only looks at the current income, but also looks at the future expectations.
It is quite obvious that the expectation of Meta is not enough.
In order to tell the new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the story of "Yuniverse".
Yuan Yuchu really should be one of the directions of the future, but the realization period of Yuan Yuchu is relatively long. This story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in these two or three years.
Therefore, the next two years will be a difficult time for Meta.
Don't look now, but the book business is in the doldrums. Sales of $10 billion to $20 billion a year are nothing to sneeze at, but compared with other Internet companies and high-tech firms, there's no moat of protection.
Although his few social media are popular now, they are mainstream social media, such as Facebook and WhatsApp. Faced with the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook has no confidence, and the gap between them is just blind hard work.
And the concept of Yuan Yuxiu, which is promising but difficult to achieve, has not been successful in a short period of time. Therefore, Face Book is very dangerous. This is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg keeps changing his company's name and is always looking for new directions. However, I think his choice of direction is wrong. It is a dead end. These are some of my thoughts for reference.
