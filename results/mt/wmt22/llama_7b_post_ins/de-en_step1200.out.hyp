The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm a #PRS_ORG# wholesale customer, so it's no problem for me.
All I need is a number or instruction as to what I should add to the package so that it can be tracked as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG a few days ago... for 249€.
Today, it costs 179€.
I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and place a new order for the better price, or is there another way to apply the discount?
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Look for a moment, help for a moment, bring the bottle etc.
They learn responsibility, help with the family, and are involved.
As long as they can still have enough children, I see no problem.
If your K1 is busy for a short time and it is OK for him, that's good.
You can best assess whether this is suitable for your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and sit with him for hours until he falls asleep.
Legally, it is questionable.
Perhaps this is why the psychologist made the statement.
Because if something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to worry about K2.
Whether this is now a risk that you want to take is of course your decision.
Please help me find the title of a book!
A few years ago, I read a crime / thriller and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title will not come to me at all. Maybe someone knows?
The story was about fear and how to overcome it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself with food and going into the enclosure with his lions.
The case is taken on by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, accuses his therapist of running a clinic where he treats fear patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and goes to this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of the suicide and document it and post the photos online.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist is running some kind of underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the patient's brain that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and the patients ultimately face their fears in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to death)
This is called "the fight" in the book.
At the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital that had a fire.
That's the rough action I'm pretty sure that the book was written by a French author / author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone can reveal the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that can take time.
What should I do next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Kind, 4 j., Splitter under the fingernail
Kind, four years, has splinters of wood under the fingernail (outside).
Attempted to pull him with a pinch.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try to do it.
No chance.
I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.

Due to Omikron: Johnson wants booster shot
Politicians and scientists in Great Britain are dealing with new Omikron cases.
Therefore, all adults in England who qualify should receive an offer of vaccination by New Year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster than planned in the course of the Corona vaccination campaign, given the rapidly increasing number of Omikron cases.
Every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots on Sunday evening.
Until now, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to speed up the vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the Omicron variant, one is confronted with an emergency situation, which means that the vaccination protection must be strengthened urgently, Johnson said.
The good news is that the vaccination level can be raised again with a third dose.
Let's boost now, said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more cases of Omikron were registered in Great Britain, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I'm for everyone using pronouns
I have sent an application.
Today, the invitation came by email.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter," but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone help me?
** I am an immigrant and I don't want to step on anyone's toes.
Conclusion: everyone should get used to pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
Four of them go.
Only the one thing I bought today does not work
Obviously, the chair had a not visible defect when sold.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months?
First on the #PRS_ORG.
This has been the case for some time.
14 days.
That is why I have always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I would like to add 2 chairs to the order and have the bill sent to me.
The feeling of not being able to help.
Content warning: I will write something more detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something from the heart.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really nags me and unfortunately occurs far too often is that many victims do not seek help or think we could not help them.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of taking the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to accept violence.
I often wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
It will never get any easier.
Please remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incomprehensibly important.
Arcane on Netflix: What is the series for "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, an amazing presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently been launched on Netflix.
Why are we excited about the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby defeat for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on youngster Johannes Patrick, there was hope.
Again, nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick looked back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
After the game, however, she did not give up - but rather increased it to 61-72 (28-38) in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Where more than the bare result disappointed the way of the appearance.
To illustrate the entire dilemma, a statistic is cited: the three-pointer quota was only 13 percent, 4 goals (all by young Johannes Patrick) on 31 attempts - any more questions?
John Patrick gave the answer: "After the victory in Teneriffa, we were simply not concentrated enough and did not implement what we had trained for."
That is, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like 10,000 people.
Only 750 spectators were allowed into the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team to victory.
The best playmaker that I have ever trained, praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team, the performance leaders like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed all over the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came within eight points of catching up after they had already trailed by 39-59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for arguing.
The giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (7:00 p.m.) and in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have checked the legal situation again and have contacted them again.
We reported a half a year ago.
Always like an egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He manages to excite his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
At the moment, he is on tour with the program "Good morning, lucky love."
Max Raabe actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert was postponed to May 2022 - "on the order of the authorities" to contain the coronavirus.
Other of his planned appearances in Advent are also cancelled for the time being, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to catch up on their already postponed 2020 dates due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang as a youngster a lot and with pleasure.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, together with his fellow students, he founded the Palast Orchester.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place in the charts, just like his successful album "For Women, This Is Not a Problem" (2013).
He has made it from the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with his blond hair slicked back and attention to detail, Max Raabe is unmistakable in the current German-speaking music scene.
Since 2020, he has been on tour with the program "Good morning, lucky love." dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we can check in advance whether it matches the color
It still doesn't work. I can only long for the cover page, but I can't turn the pages.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Through expropriation, no new homes are created
New Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as was demanded in a popular vote in Berlin.
With expropriation, "not a single new apartment is created, only the owner structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and the Left wants to set up an expert commission to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz is not ruling out further tightening of the rental law in coalition talks with the FDP.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent cap until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tight housing markets, and an expansion of the rental market.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not loosen up despite that, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be available again?
Or will it ever happen again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great
Then I would solve it independently when ordering a new one
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is sent in March, how long does the shipment take?
I have already cut my finger
This is an absolute scandal
At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes moved through the USA.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be reported.
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes caused severe damage in the USA and may have claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave a 320-kilometer-long trail of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area that everything was gone everywhere the tornado had passed through.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants and roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to 100 deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official figures are rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that the #NAME# vitrine is sold out.
That is very sad.
Is it still produced?
Or is it completely off the menu?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
When will you report?
If the delivery cannot be made to my home, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I now order the cover and have it delivered to Germany?
I had returned an article via the contact form or cancelled a return, and wanted to ask whether it had arrived or been processed, as I have not yet received any confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money for vaccination.
In doing so, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Austrian Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - after the German example - should increase the willingness to get vaccinated.
He has changed companies over which he has lashed out.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It has been a year.
He has obviously not glued himself to his old position and has looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: no problem.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will then be relevant in law.
I'm taking a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Boron to the ground!
I'm currently leading an adventure Over the Greifen Pass for a group of four friends, and I want to seamlessly integrate my heroes into a campaign written especially for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arc is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out, and now I am writing the introductory adventure and stumble over my own feet during the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to take a wagon with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Thuran Lake.
The further action is to take place there.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to ambush the heroes and lure them into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: Convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, whatever occurs to the players.
Group size: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords
The goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a hollow way, armed with three left and right bows, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart is, of course, gone.
2. If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf with two of his knights attacks the heroes in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything is super.
How appropriate is your Deus ex Machina from solution 2?
Is the encounter as an introduction to the adventure too much?
The Goblins group will later play a decisive role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I had not expected so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely implement many of your ideas, and now I also have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And back together again.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That is why I would like to send them back
If you can let me know the return address, I can package the lamp and send it to #PRS_ORG.

Is everything going to be taken away or just the space for storage?
I am tired of Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on the German Sky has been decreasing more and more, so I wanted to take a break with this post.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the start was delayed and there was an accident at the start, the schedule was far behind the plan, but they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons F1 has priority and everything else must be restricted, so that Sky DE had no choice here.
Nevertheless, stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcast the race live.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher showed a lack of knowledge of the rules, as they did not know that one can change the tires under a red flag.
Although there was a similar situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen could change the tires when there were appropriate radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators on Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that Verstappen had this possibility.
In my opinion, such elementary rules should be known if you comment on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first riddle that is now possible or mandatory according to the rules, both have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
In general, Roos does not like the artificial commentary style, but it is a matter of taste.
But I actually prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL.
There are also constant stupidities, which make both of them appear unprofessional, like ordering coffee for the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke, or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the last one brings a lot of unrest in the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the out-of-contract round, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as can be seen on F1TV, where there is only the German soundtrack without commentary, directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also make less advertising during training than Sky, and as free-to-air channels.
I have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster of the F1.
Seriously, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
So anyway, the grandiose F1 season is a lot less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should have been delivered last week and which has still not been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send it and she has never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the material has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I need help.
Air pumps are ideal for adding oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via an air pump.
This series is available in 3 versions from us.
Take a look at the table at the end of the offer.
You can compare the performance there.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are recommended, so that you can connect more than one outlet.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. However, fans are also available to set the scene in an aquarium, for example with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here, a treasure chest, mussel or similar could be mentioned.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The blower pump is connected to an exhaust pipe 4/6 mm via an air hose... and it's ready to go.
The blower pump should be the same, or higher, than the water level and should be installed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed.
Cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent water from flowing backward, which would cause water to flow out of the tank through the pump...
If the fan is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, as other air pumps are.
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we state the processing time as 3 days here on ebay, the parcels are packed every day and collected every day.
Everything is going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to take a little precaution so that nobody gets upset just because it took a little longer.
That's how it is, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics sector...of course, here the coronavirus is not stopping.
Please don't rate poorly just because the delivery is delayed, that is entirely the fault of the postal service.
Of course, one likes to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment,... they have it damned hard
This is also very different regionally.
Be nice to no one, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Do you also know the legs in bright?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronauts' daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally received the newly selected astronauts after their return.
Welcome back, Bezos said, wearing a blue space suit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in the air for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the astronaut Alan Shepard, who flew into space in 1961 as a Nasa astronaut, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: Space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for their tickets.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission.
He had to work hard and do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed himself enthusiastically.
He would love to go back to space again, the moderator said.
New Shepard flies to 100 kilometers
The "New Shepard" rocket system is largely automated.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during flight, reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the earth, with periods of weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned mission for Blue Origin: In July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot and a 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second, in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was there, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and Blue Origin's vice president, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
With a single click, you can choose whether your "Smart Stone" should always glow in one color or play its entire color spectrum.
Changing color, the light stone retains its color for about a minute before gently changing to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light means it can be used outdoors all year round.
In snowy surroundings, their light is even particularly good - just with a shortened lifespan, which is to be expected as the days get shorter.
In the winter, please just make sure that no snow interferes with the solar module's function.
The "Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the current Mignon (AA) format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
You can order a suitable replacement battery via our web shop and thus extend the service life of your deco light even further.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject itself quite exciting and I am not bothered in the lab (I have already completed the organic chemistry practical).
Of course, I had already researched career prospects before starting my studies, but at the time I also thought that I would definitely study until my PhD.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially about my career prospects.
On the one side (Studycheck, etc.) one constantly hears about super career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other side one constantly hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly badly paid jobs.
Therefore, I would really be interested:
1) What are you working on at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/ What education did you get?
4) Would you do it again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really uncertain and am considering breaking off my studies in 2022 and becoming an IT specialist.
If you have any experience, please write it down.
Extra stress before holidays and weekends
This topic came up for me last week.
I had to use my long weekend to unwind.
That's why a post was only put up now.
Not only during big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress at work.
As it seems, there are also holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-official.
It was a long 4-day weekend last week.
What happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
According to emails that had to be sent before departure, order here, order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Why?
Because "next week then" after so much time doesn't sound right?
Or because people want to do so much in a short week as in a normal week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also really excited.
What is this self-sacrifice for holidays?
Why do we still have holidays when we can't really enjoy them?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very independent.
My question is: Are we the only ones like that, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no presents yet.
The beautiful, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will prepare for the festival by baking and decorating cookies with her son.
I love it, said Catterfeld.
She still has a few things to do before the contemplative days: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts, I have to finally get rid of them."
NEKTON Bio supports a smooth moulting and feather renewal.
NEKTON Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of feather damage in bird breeding is due to dietary errors.
Since the feathers consist of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather coat.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the mousing are due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feedstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the application of NEKTON Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered through drinking water or feed.
Thank you, I found it

DDR hand-operated model E-lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably originates from the conversion proposal of the model railway enthusiast ME No. 11/1968, used with traces of play and parts missing, see photos, in good working order, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the German Federal Railways (DRG), designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly also originating from the small-scale manufacturer ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is on display at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working order
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to come up with proposals for an electric locomotive that could handle 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this stretch of track.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
As a result, the DRG determined in March 1926 that the locomotive would be delivered as a 1'Co + Co1' locomotive with tapered roller drive, AEG supplying the mechanical part, and the Siemens-Schuckertwerke the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All of them survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were brought to the Soviet Union as war reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
All six locomotives at the Dessau railway depot were found to be suitable for refurbishment.
The three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled in 1959 as the medium-voltage network in central Germany was being progressively electrified, and the other locomotives were used as spares.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are available in larger quantities, were preferred.
It was only when it became clear that the E94 could not be further increased that the E95 came into focus.
First, the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They came to the railway depot in Halle P. in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
It was more common for the shooter to remain stuck to the target.
Then the Beimann, who always travels with the locomotive, had to release the shooter during the journey with a hammer and wooden wedge.
Damage to the traction motors occurred more frequently and led to months of downtime for the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives available, and the expansion of electric operations was not planned at that time, so the Reichsbahn could dispense with old locomotives and most splinter types, and the E 95 was taken out of service.
In addition, the German Federal Railway wanted to staff electric locomotives with only one man, which would have caused problems in train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service in mid-1969, the E 95 01 was the last to leave service on October 5, 1970.
The new name 255 001 was never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a heating system on the main station in Halle.
It took some time for those responsible at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive underwent initial external processing with the goal of presenting it at a vehicle exhibition in the RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
The locomotive is cared for at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operation of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented to an exhibition in the museum's depot in Arnstadt for the first time, with a new internal and external paint job, and the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian mountain railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves reliable due to their dependable drive system and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were transferred to Leipzig for the middle German network.
The main deployment area was initially Silesia
H0 handcrafted model, functioning well, optical refinements to the locomotive are necessary in the owner's workshop, dusty, with toy tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handcrafted model, small edition - possibly also from the small series manufacturer ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can bear labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with some of them.
The central beam is held up by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't put the bed together.
The central beam is held up by two feet, which are unfortunately faulty.
The middle beam does not fit into the planned support.
I also receive new ones.
When will they be sent?
No flat.
According to the installation instructions, these are the right ones, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
I am not flat
Could I receive this?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in an apartment in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport onto the adjacent house in Kinsau (district of Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were taken to the hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not rule out arson.
The Criminal Investigation Department of Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But that comes much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To weaken fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin has not yet made a public statement about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo of his coronavirus vaccination.
The illness of a friend prompted him to share, said Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false rumors on social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
For months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counter the false rumors.
Until now, he has rejected this because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 infection and has been attached to a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
However, "the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and distrust."
It is difficult to fight fear with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says that he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
I am not allowed by law to get the vaccine myself at the moment, Şahin said at the time.
There is a priority for vaccination in Germany.
By now, the priority has long been lifted - and according to his own statements, the biotech boss has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: Ten thousand people without power
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and, in many cases, no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage to an electricity substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhineland-Palatinate district of Rhein-Sieg have been without power for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the lights went out in 41,000 households in several municipalities as a result of the fire.
The power supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power units had been in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely repaired late in the evening.
Firefighters and volunteers of the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered places in schools for care and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless work, said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repairs will still take a few days, as the Westnetz workers were only able to put some lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire, which broke out on Friday at 19:15, damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Expensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, power supply has been restored.
Since Saturday at 18:00, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected at 9:30 p.m.
Since 9:15 p.m., power has also been restored to those who were most recently affected by the outage.
More than 80 workers from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
After setting up emergency power supplies for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for help from the neighborhood.
It is now important that citizens look after their elderly or lonely neighbors, and inform the local fire department if help is needed, explained district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power systems, the residents of nursing homes were the focus.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those people who cannot look after themselves or who need electrical medical equipment or medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the daytime cover #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day and stay healthy ♡
I can't mount it on the tabletop.
It is a Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted those with tabletops with a diameter of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
Today, my #PRS_ORG came, but I can't squeeze it in and thus shorten it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a response
Yes, that is really easier!
Then we'll do it!
Can you send me the return receipt by email?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, I had not restarted the e-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low discount almost unbelievable.
We are not in agreement with that
Nordic Combined: Combined skier Riiber wins
The German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have reached the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.

Retour of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both made new and use version 4.5...
It could be the case that they have already heard about the problem
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG, it seems to be on it.
If I want to open it, the message comes, ups!
This document cannot be opened.
The file may be faulty, they report to the customer service.
As far as I can see, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me further?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I also have to work!
So that the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the parts with some soap and water, rinse them with clear water, and dry them.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the parts that are no longer visible or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the part
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers ensures a uniform surface later.
Avoid fast wiping with the brush.
This results in unrealistically large areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come to a close with a separate brush.
Otherwise, there can be unpleasant metal streaks when they mix with normal colors.
Leave the painted parts to dry for a day before you sand them.
The models achieve their original appearance through the decals or stickers.
From flags on aircraft to ship names to decorations and emblems on automobiles: The decals give the models the final touch.
Put the decals on in the right order while the parts are still easily accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be covered before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool, such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks, are time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut each needed decal individually and lay them down.
Decals are also called water transfer images, because you briefly moisten their back with water until the carrier paper turns dark from the moisture.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper to the side.
Attention: Always check if the picture is properly stuck to the paper before you completely remove it from the paper, so it doesn't stick to your fingers, knuckles or tears.
Remove excess water with a towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time, as soon as I look at something else, I can't read the book anymore and have to log out and log in again and load the book again and find the place where I left off.
AM Saturday, I have already communicated with you.
Will I get it by email?
For all three packages?
Because the lamp came to me in three separate packages
Thank you anyway!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Will I get it back easily?
Kinderwunsch treatment for PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for a while, and now, when it comes to dealing with the PKV, this suddenly becomes an issue.
One after the other:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the PKV and were given the go-ahead for three attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
A few months later, we tried to have a second child, and carried out two (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count on the PKV.
We again applied for the costs to be covered by the PKV and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we carried out more trials than agreed, logically the most expensive with the PKV), we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3), the PKV is only going to reimburse 3 trials.
The justification: With the pregnancy/birth, the other two attempts of the first commitment are cancelled.
The second child is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, "The insurance case begins with the treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
Who has the right, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (there are 5 attempts to reimburse)?
Did the PKV have to point out to us in the contract that the further tests would be cancelled with a birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you for your help!
Could you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can achieve them best?
OK.
We will no longer order anything from them.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME (same address), they have obviously lost good customers.
They are happy to pass this on to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back.
I can't do anything about the fact that the wardrobe arrives completely disorganized at me
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote
It is clear and obvious that the repayment was prompted and I have still not received any repayment from #PRS_ORG
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We will no longer do that.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
In any case, the guarantee of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cupboard and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG
These products are advertised with additional purchasing hooks, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Theme of the week: The best low budget films
There is no general definition of a low-budget film with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>Ein **Low-Budget-Film** oder **Low-Budget-Movie** ist ein Film, der mit wenig bis keinem Geld von einem großen Filmstudio oder einem privaten Investor finanziert wird.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, for example on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, I have already completely furnished two apartments with your furniture.
Wanted to find out the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now reliable?
Many thanks
With friendly greetings
If there is no telephone number, a chat, where you have to wait 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll give up soon, because it simply doesn't work here.
Hello
Half victory against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) explained.
This state of suspension - Belarus is not giving in completely, but the EU feels like the winner - will probably go on for a while longer.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
Apparently, there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided against it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion in the Union.
If a member state decides to do its own thing, it seems that the EU is powerless to stop it, as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex to access its borders.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: An agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Attempt to cross the border again
According to Poland's border guards, meanwhile, migrants have again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border fences.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko of being the ruler in Minsk, luring him with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to the countries of origin to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU reaction is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
The EU has thrown its market power into the scales and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take account of internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not interested in the fact that the security apparatus regularly shuttles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has appealed.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest relates to a supposed violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second appeal was filed at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed.
Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and won his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutchman overtook the car in front of him.
I check it.
I speak with the bank and re-register with you
thank you for the support
Free entry for members: Europa Park organises a SC Freiburg fantasy day
The Europa Park, named after the Europa Park Stadium of the Sport Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
According to the park, members and long-term ticket holders of the sports club from the Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains shone red and white on this day through the T-shirts.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," the park said.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the Freizeitpark in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa Park, it was once again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing glowing fans having fun on the roller coaster confirms that," says Europa Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not €1,699?

However, these data only apply to exactly defined conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to use your loupe optimally, we ask you to take note of the information in the "Technical Data" table (see instructions in the packaging).
Light reflexes are created on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including impact lenses.
Antireflective coatings significantly reduce these reflections.
If the optimal use conditions are met - the loupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: Women in Krembz search for Christmas trees
Frank Diers, a farmer, has already experienced many curious situations when selling Christmas trees.
Once, a man drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree on anything.
He plants around 2000 of them every year.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many curious situations.
The Christmas season always makes it a bit more fun, he says.
And with the voucher?
Otherwise, I'm a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be the "Dreher," which does not sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with glass fibre + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass fibre connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems setting up a stable WiFi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used the Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly at 50 Mbit, with a few exceptions.
The new glass fibre connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receives these.
However, at the other end of the DLan module, which transmits the Wi-Fi, the full 500 no longer comes, but the further I move away from the module in the house, the less comes (so I use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber-optic connection is now even slower in the first floor than before (45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similar large losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is "lost" when using glass fibre?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay new LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I have created an extra account here.
That is why I would be even more pleased about an answer.
When it is time to change the bank account
Anyone who thought that now there would be calm in the Giro accounts is mistaken.
While many banks used the autumn to confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are also falling.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the free bet and even quartered it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank subsidiary - to 50,000 euros for current accounts and investment accounts, and 25,000 euros for day-to-day accounts.
However, these lower guarantees now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers."
The Commerzbank had already lowered its limit to 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as is the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
Nevertheless: According to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have a deductible of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda Bank of Berlin also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance won against this regulation at the Berlin Regional Court.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutes should form reserves - in the event that the higher authorities also declare the negative interest rates to be unlawful in principle and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.
The tabletop for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people.
The base is that for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, this success is first and foremost the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of their appearance.
After all, Aniston says, she treats herself to a chip every day (yes, really: a single chip from the bag).
The fact that they manage to win the hearts of female and male fans alike is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she simply has bad luck with love - and is still looking for the big love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
People who ask me that have no idea what is going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It is to be hoped that success and fame will make one happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn peeled off his gloves and wiped sweat from his brow.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight touch of the band, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after only half the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport king class.
To say goodbye, his wife Minttu and their two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix, started 18 times from pole, and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins two-man bob - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
I've worked it out, I'd have to win nine and a half races a season, and I might make it to Cortina 2026, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who won two races in two days at the Winterberg races.
On Saturday, he defended his position from Johannes Lochner by five hundredths of a second.
Then he changed something in the material setting and drove out on Sunday with 0.30 seconds ahead.
Together with his teammates Thorsten Margis (SV Halle) and Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), he defeated the Brit Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded, said Friedrich, who also extended his winning streak to 22.
The Berchtesgaden native Johannes Lochner, who drives for Stuttgart, came in fifth this time.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
If I knew what he was doing, I would do the same, said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third home victory of the season in the two-woman bob.
After finishing in fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to victory in the world cup on Sunday with brakewoman Deborah Levi.
Two-woman bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she scored her first podium this winter.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki came third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool to get the first podium place in the world cup, I am super happy that Mariama is coming with me.
I am very happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and stressed: "It is not just pushing, but there is a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not quite error-free rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could now buy it!
What should I do?
I did not receive it and therefore could not cash it, which is why I finally asked.
Last year, due to the coronavirus, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had run out, which made me very angry.
Looking at the chat, it was about the Asare seat.
I want to return it and then order it again, since it is currently on sale.
Why is the shipment not starting until 16 March?
There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time
No, only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear girls and women,
I've got a few things I want to write about and maybe it will interest the one - or others too...
I am 24, have kPTBS, am a full-time student and a dog mother - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (together for 6J) is sick, he got second-degree burns on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I have emotional needs too and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand was in a cast due to burns).
On top of that, he is cold and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2x per week), which is causing me a lot of trouble with my need for affection and love.
My dog is suffering from stomach ache, I have cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I warmed him up and stroked him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now comes the homework, which we will of course divide among ourselves.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS is just right at the moment, I am halfway through therapy and am getting better.
Not good, but I get by and am almost symptom-free.
My university is asking for a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 p.m. I have a written test for which I haven't prepared anything, and the next day I have an anatomy lecture for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and then what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room there.
That's how my week goes: Just until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, does everything continue?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental anchors because otherwise I'd go nuts.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it any other way...
Is it the same for you?
Ehrlich, I am eternally grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly eternally grateful, I cannot put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived otherwise.
I think that has something to do with the mental load of women, and that is why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you a pleasant evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately, it is a different color and the surface is scratched and the table leg has a print.
In the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In addition, twice.
This was not confirmed.
It was completely different: I noticed at school that many religion teachers did not believe in God and it was just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, this was always something strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always had some kind of faith.
How do you feel about it?
Maybe you can also tell stories from work and study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be odd to have a physics teacher who did not believe in the theory of relativity.
What brings someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Culture or something like that?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can it be changed or not? Write in English, I also understand that.
That's been a long time, then I'd avoid it
That's good, thank you.
I expect a response by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME.
Film search help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I believe it was a film for young people.
There are two time periods (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead).
Since I cannot describe it any closer in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (in uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so he can live.
I believe the transition is also the soldier's grave.
In the end, I believe both soldiers will fight each other.
If this is something you say, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child holds much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything around it is right, no cuddly animals, go in more often and look, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
And we didn't have a sleeping bag, we always had a blanket.
Observe your child when it is sleeping.
Does it turn its head?
Can it stand up from the stomach?
Or is it with the face in the mattress?
You can derive from this whether everything is in order.
We've all grown up and when my husband was born, it was a big gang and give that you put the kids to sleep on your stomach.
In addition, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought a lot of articles
But why do you only offer me 20 euros?
Hello, I wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have received no reply so far.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID #).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not usable.
To put it quite clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply the case that the politics of this broadcaster have become a laughingstock.
Every format is sponsored (OK), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Arno quote: "You don't want to be a running billboard."
What are we now?
A 0815 advertiser who tries to bring his billboard to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
These of course apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and tries to make a name for himself at the expense of the action with the exploded rooms.
How do you find all that?
Toll if you like it, I find it horrible.
I am asking for a recall because my delivered wooden table is defective.
Body damage due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for tummy aches or just for cuddling - my little heat source is versatile.
Kirsch kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing warmth, as the kernels absorb and release heat very well.
The removable inner cushion can be easily warmed in the microwave or oven.
The soft connection makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The Kirschkern cushion with reference is suitable exclusively for the following applications:

In the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (information from the microwave manufacturer)
After heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then, put the cushion back in place.
During the first warming, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, which disappears with repeated applications.
Please adhere to the given heating instructions, as long periods or high energy levels can cause damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Check with the manufacturer before warming up the milk in the microwave to see if they allow heating of grain products in the instructions.
After the heated inner cushion was replaced, please check the temperature of the cushion on your armrest to ensure it is suitable for babies (max. 43 °C)!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, bleeding and open wounds, or in people with reduced pain perception.

Darmstadt second after the first half - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt under their third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed start under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20 KQ and about 3 years old) stopped charging via my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the battery alone is enough for operation.
The battery is empty and the laptop won't start even though the power cord is plugged in.
I then expanded the battery, but again, nothing happened.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop online?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the #PRS_ORG to be delivered to my room.
How can I book that?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is....
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design!
The 20-liter capacity also swallows larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stowed using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what you need for everyday items is well organised and separable from the photo equipment in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The slick, minimalist design has it in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the rucksack while still providing quick access to the photo equipment.
This works with two options: either conventionally via the flap, which can be closed using the MagLatch closure system, an outstandingly thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself on messenger bags.
In the closing flap there is a metal latch with suitable anchor bolts on the front of the rucksack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered various "filling levels": there are four anchor bars, solidly welded, into which the latch can be inserted.
If the backpack is full, you take the top board, if it is rather empty, a deeper one.
The shutters and hooks are also magnetic.
The rucksack can be closed reliably without the hook.
The second option is also fundamentally different from other photo backpacks: in addition to the flap, there is also a tear-off opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the suitability of the rucksack for everyday use: If you are not only taking your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more about this below) and thus easily separate both items without any problems - and access them through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items stay safely in the left backpack pocket and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, easy-to-disguise support belts help.
And since the exterior of the rucksack is also made from 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the content remains dry even when it is going to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.
Yesterday, #NAME# sent me an email confirming the appointment of
Spedition announces contact for picking up the wrongly delivered table.
Until now, I have not received any message.
I ask for immediate processing.
I have now been writing to the third support employee, and with none of them have I got further than a promise that I would receive an email confirmation.
It is the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
When could the cabinet be delivered?
It is not an option for me...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
I wish you a nice evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will immediately place a larger order, but nevertheless, I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected, I could not imagine and have not been able to call and clarify at the right time.
But I as a customer do not accept that.
Rottinger brake discs are designed for the requirements of dynamic drivers, who appreciate the reliability and safety of braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are cast and then mechanically machined (bored and cut).
All the glass is produced in short series according to individual technical properties, which are specific to certain glass and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created that focuses on the extraction of the disc after the properties of the original assembly.
The resulting tuned discs ensure high comfort and brake effectiveness.
Additional openings increase the efficiency of cooling the glass, while the grooves improve the cleaning of brake discs and brake blocks.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned wheels underline the character of each car through their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shiny fragments in the water at the southern bifurcation of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of 1849.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels arose almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, breed horses, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You have to choose your actions simultaneously, keep an eye on your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions or change the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years, from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is unveiled and they place their pioneers in the right locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a block!
This deactivates half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, exploring rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning revolver heroes.
When all the actions have been completed, the pioneers return.
The advertiser rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, thereby changing the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, which means that each location has been covered once and the year ends.
There is a shootout where the players have to defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have recruited enough gunmen and are numerically superior to the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is determined.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I take up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
With everything else, usually DPD insured and with delivery tracking (games followed, wrapped in fly paper and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also send the album in a cardboard sleeve for a fee of 2 euros, which will prevent any pressure marks.
Why children are not tyrants, documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it immediately.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why our children are becoming tyrants" (2008), he triggered a heated debate on education.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be aware, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Parents and other caregivers should never, never, never have power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child room for development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is possible and sensible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries discuss the abolition of the test obligation for triple vaccination
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the test obligation for triple vaccination at their next meeting.
We need clarity quickly as to whether and from when unvaccinated people can be exempt from the test, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to the "Bild am Sonntag".
The withdrawal of 2G plus for triple vaccination is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has confirmed that "he will submit a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on Tuesday". - afp
I also want to send the lamp back
What should I do?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I cannot see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer process any purchases through my #PRS_ORG.
Error message: Oops, something went wrong.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated my contact data.
What is the cause of this?
What you are describing is *Awareness*, which is sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
It is most common to hear sounds/voices, rarely to see images, and most rarely to feel pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, since in order to protect the child, a very deep anesthetic is avoided until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Specific anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but Nitemarex did not have it by definition.
I misread her comment.
The chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros don't help.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the eCommerce sector.
Please check if they can at least take back the broken chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose money there.
I sent you an email that you didn't answer.
The question again.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
A man told me that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG.
Is that so?
If so, I will have to cancel the order, as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture upstairs.
Am I not being called?
I had a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has profiled himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older."
The theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept this diary until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby dedicate my life to you."
There are various types of palettes.
One of the most common is the Euro pallet, a standardized wooden pallet that is used as a load carrier in the European area.
They are certified by the European pallet association EPAL
According to data from the Statistics Austria, over ten million palettes were produced in Austria in 2020.

Roulade tips and tricks
I had received many great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
There was that at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thank you again for that :)
Now I've got a taste for it and want to cook a roulade for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow, I will use a cow fund for that.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books? How do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but that's okay
IEs is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was informed by email on 18 January that the refund had been processed.
But to date, the money has not been received by me.
Could you please check that?
Where there is still Christmas ham in Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you not ordered any chicken yet?
The time is running out now.
We tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube output stage plays a major role in the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-Regler, you can set the desired level and the overload of your sound at the same time.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL regulator, with which the sound level can be reduced without changing anything on the "gain" and distortion.
Further up, it sounded as if you could even use the POWER LEVEL control to create a reserve of performance if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a boxing simulation, so that even when using headphones or direct recordings, you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression.
AUX can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice recorder.
Anyone who also buys a VFS5 foot controller can call up the sounds conveniently by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off, and change the tempo of the compatible effects "tap".
This is actually essential for live deployment.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But that's how others have seen it.
Is it possible to send the lamp back?
Because it is too low for over a table?
I would also like to send them back.
Can you help me further?
And the wardrobe?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, have you already sat on the #PRS_ORG chairs
If it doesn't work, I'd be happy with a legacy or voucher.
Perhaps I will find a buyer for the furniture.
Only for goods that I don't need are 1,000 euros a lot.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door).
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded

Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreement
According to Iranian sources, progress is being made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
Iran's chief negotiator, Ali Bagheri, told the news agency Irna on Sunday that both sides are close to agreeing on the issues on the agenda.
This is a "positive and important development," because at the beginning there was no agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a nearly week-long break.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen overtakes Saxony - Freistaat now federal state with highest coronavirus incidence
Thüringen has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in the country.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
On Sunday, Thuringia was the only federal state in which the number of cases exceeded 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value at 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always had the highest incidence in the country, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had dropped slightly, but was still above 1000.
In Thüringen, 2,242 new cases of infection with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within a day.
200 seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, the health departments have been overloaded for weeks and are struggling to keep up with new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery is scheduled for early March, it may still be possible.
I have to print it and stick it on the package and send it to the post, right?
Do I have to do anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to pay for the return.
Eight euro return fee is in my opinion a cheek.
It is time for changes
Dear Members of the Bundestag, I am delighted to welcome you to this fantastic day in the heart of Europe!
Why the post here?
If you take a look at the activity of the Bundestag in recent months, one thing is clear: It does not exist.
We are in a winter rut and have extended the summer hole for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what happened?
For the most part, this is simply a matter of dissatisfaction with how some things have turned out and how we generally stand.
In the last few days, there has been a growing sense that many people here still want to go to the federal conference.
What we need to change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag wants to know who wants to keep it alive.
The initiative came from u/edizVEVO, who recently became aware of this project and found a pile of shards.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have found each other and are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would like to call on everyone again to participate, so that this project can continue to exist in the future.
To this end, we have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the Bundestag work in the future?
What existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves externally in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
How do we achieve a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot some things, but that's not so bad, we have the Discord for that.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/klobig for me and not suitable for my taste.
For this reason, I have already ordered a different hanger from you.
I put it together and noticed it when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, since the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: do you have the daytime cover #PRS_ORG# in extra large, for example in 240/240?
PRS_ORG must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be removed promptly.
And I beg you to do so now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will try to dismantle the wardrobe as far as possible for collection - they will have to sort out with #PRS_ORG how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there an installation guide?
How long would I have to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today, I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself lived as a vegetarian for a while, and currently eats meat only rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned transition, I answered honestly without much thought.
In fact, I used to think that by being a vegetarian, I would be supporting the well-being of animals, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
This is why I decided to become vegan.
In that moment, I got the impression that she was annoyed, she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that vegetarians could reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, one is quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise that one would not want.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;
It is not an exception after § 312d BGB.
Their #PRS_ORG# do not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be picking up my return at the assigned date, on which #PRS_ORG will pick me up.
Since I cannot be there in person due to a funeral, I'm afraid that can't be changed.
Could you please assign me an alternative pick-up date?
I will be available again from 01.02.#NUMBER#.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for water rescue equipped: 45,000 euros subsidy from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, handed over a grant of €45,000 for the new water rescue vehicle of the volunteer fire department in Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to €135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatine supports us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatine.
They perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they are used to increasing numbers: The boom in hotel ships on the Rhine and Moselle, and the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, are contributing to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I cannot open the book.
I have followed her recommendations, removed and reloaded the app, but NOTHING has worked.
I am a little frustrated because the whole operation took a lot of time and I hope for help now.
Okay, then.
I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS_ORG collection in June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the previously mentioned values were determined in the Fenix Laboratory at 21°C ± 3°C, 50% - 80% relative humidity and the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.
The values ​​can vary depending on the used pocket lamp, age and environment.

6) To assert a guarantee claim, please provide the following information to our guarantee department: Name, type / model of the guarantee object, serial number.
Thank you first of all for taking the time to deal with the whole matter, I too spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar role, that is to say we were bodyguards in the executive, and I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, one should say that of course the state employee comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, everyone knows that people on the right tend to be attracted to people in uniforms and people with guns, and that these people can have a hard time dealing with the real world, because, of course, you have, in addition to the average white person, many Germans with a migration background, women, and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the overly feminine stereotype, because there are hardly any of those in the executive, but rather normal men and women, whom one doesn't notice if they don't tell you), and I can rely on these people too, because in doubt, they will save your life or put their own in danger for you.
But even these fringe groups, it seems, have a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel disadvantaged by overly left-wing policies, even if these policies are supposedly aimed at them and they feel they have to be set right. They just want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, because of course the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right there, but they are openly allowed to say their opinion there or even hatch any state-threatening plans, which is completely overblown and annoys me too.
Of course, it is not uncommon for police officers and soldiers who have often been on foreign missions to start generalizing and saying things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing sympathizers meet and engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, such things are well combated and countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined, and that is a good thing in my opinion, that we could not even afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand, I have also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered in November.
but it was confirmed in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I have previously chatted with #NAME.
Alternatively, the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros could be delivered to Germany, or this basket is also available in Germany somewhere.
I always find you as a partner company.
However, two deep grooves can be seen at the edge of the wooden part, which have been filled with something yellow.
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself
Ordinary through child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organised at work (I am self-employed and have very little free time), but I have always struggled to keep my finances in order.
There are always phases when everything stays the same, and then and again it gets me and I pack up and clean.
But it is actually never the case that "someone spontaneously comes to visit."
My husband is (unfortunately) not better, it bothers me somewhere but mostly the budget just loses out to work and laziness.
The kitchen is cleaned most often because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become a decent parent?
We don't have one yet, but we are working on it and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
Because for me there is no incentive, it just doesn't bother me that much as long as there are no visitors and there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you remain sluggish?
I am looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically shaped cut, offers maximum comfort, perfect fit and enables almost unrestricted movement.
Forming with special, further shaping at the joints for improved movement freedom (in arm and knee bends)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulder, arm and knee bends)
High-quality mouldings in the lower back area and in the step ensure a close-fitting, perfect seat.
Elaskin's 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar region increases flexibility in the back area and improves comfort, especially when bending and when installing and removing equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is located around the shoulders and the back, guarantees increased flexibility in movements of the arms and the back.
Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal on the face of the hat increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate headband)
A soft, foldable zone improves the seal with a fine-adjustable width setting by a flexible, gentle Velcro closure, which does not stick to the casing or the stitches.
Double-sided zippers on the arm and foot joints connect a detachable inner jacket with a soft, cushioned neoprene outer jacket
45° inward curve at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and durability when putting on.
Longer zipper at the neck with an elastic reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without helmet
Langer G-Lock P back lock with metal bolt and water dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)
Reißverschlüsse on arms and legs
Neopren reinforcements on all ends of the breakable connections to prevent breaking if excessive force is applied.
Neopren panels bonded with external and internal overlapping
Edges of the outside manschets seamed for greater durability
Edges of the inner cuffs embroidered for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wristwatch computers).
Career in social work - as someone with a personality disorder?
I have a degree in software development and have been learning for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am more and more aware that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering studying social work for a while now.
The problem: I have an insecure (or fearful) personality disorder.
This means that I have no self-esteem and am correspondingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have been told that I come across as unapproachable (which I think I have become better at).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth centre, but rather in examples such as drug counselling or family support.
But I don't know if the concrete working day is really like I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something about it on the Internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to criticize in my code ("just simple things messed up again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how this goes by now"/"I take them off work with my stupid questions"/"he has to put up with me being half-educated" etc.).
I will probably have problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation.
I'm waiting for a pickup
What do they want to give back, please?
If I have downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG, the message I authorized this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein taken in with the feed is broken down in the bird's gastrointestinal tract into the individual amino acids, and the bird uses these to build its own proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the new feather formation in the growing bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high demand for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON Bio should not be administered during breeding, as this can lead to disruptions in the breeding process.
After this regular gift from NEKTON Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio in 250 ml water or 100 g feed.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/feed as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/feed daily.
A stained measuring spoon (inset) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON Bio.
If the feather damage is severe, the double or triple dose of NEKTON Bio can be given until the new feather growth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until the feather renewal is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON Bio should be stored dry, without direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty period in Germany is 24 months.
That is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Community worker's statement in contradiction to the constitution
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree will be felled on our property.
Fallant application to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees is not part of the by-laws.
The walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree in the statute.
Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I can rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
I thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me an inheritance or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the cover sent to Germany
Can you check that?
Emergency call: Serious traffic accident in Selb
A serious traffic accident occurred recently on the St 2179 between the Selb North junction and Plößberg.
According to a press release from the police (14:03), a car overtook in the wrong lane.
There are injured people.
Okay, I understand.
Great, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Rat and ideas for further career life
Happy Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is only moderately good, because my dear head is currently processing everything that can be processed.
Before I dive in here now... in short: I need advice and best from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm just starting out as a cross-over.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in a department there (in order to at least stay anonymous, I won't mention anything more specific).
The whole thing was too boring for me and I started looking for alternatives that would be more fun.
At some point, I landed in teaching and was sure that's what I wanted - even though the framework conditions are much less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I am now at the third "I Google other job postings."
And it's only been half a year.
In the past, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after which I can still change direction.
But I am absolutely ready.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely drained.
Now there are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
In front of the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was also my weekend, my weekend and my party evening my party evening.
I had the freedom.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in the moment.
Now the family party is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that make me even more nervous.
In principle, it is fun and from the outside, the Ref also runs well, which is the feedback and so on.
But I am completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it hasn't already.
I ask myself whether I want to go through the rest of my working life like this - just when I read some of your contributions - or whether I should not rather go back to the old area, where I was valued, where I was allowed to take my free time if I needed it, and where work was boring, but was paid appropriately and I was part of a team who had achieved something together.
But then I ask myself whether I won't be in the same place a year from now as I am now and dissatisfied.
You know, it's all kind of weird, but perhaps outsiders can offer advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation, in which I'm completely finished and practically start crying at the slightest thought.
I'm not going to make any emotional decisions now, which is probably not going to lead to anything good.
But perhaps your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for the time being.
Thank you for reading and sorry for the whiny tone of me.
I hope that my situation is at least a little clearer now.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has been continuously developed, leading to the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X, VT40X, and VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand-new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube pre-amplifier.
This is based in part on real analog circuits, because these are better at handling the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only bubble up.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then in order to meet new sound requirements, which again led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
The new VT+ Valvetronix series, ranging from the VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, has also been designed to meet the needs of all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of dynamics and string attack, and prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage determines the tube characteristic of a power amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable clasp parts, it adapts to the needs of your photo equipment and is suitable for all kinds of cameras – from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible stocking would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three changeable lenses and a pop-up flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still allow for additional lenses.
In addition, one can still store a lot of accessories.
And anyone who has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for things that are not camera-related.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Vulcan eruption on La Palma: longest in history
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists dared not make any predictions about when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Millions in damages
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1,000-degree-hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Nearly 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new landmasses with a total area of about 50 hectares have emerged off the coast due to the cooling of lava.
The banana industry, which is of immense importance to the island, was particularly hard hit, with around half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants depending on it directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were heavily affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is approaching and the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree are combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas belongs to the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important, therefore, to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a "peace-promoting 'social contract' of pre-industrial societies," can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became Christkind
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days closely with the giving of gifts.
Previously, gifts were exchanged on Christmas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, threw gold into the window of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving birth to the German tradition of filling children's shoes with gifts.
Protestants objected to this practice because they consider intermediaries between God and man to be "idolatry."
For these reasons, they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Nikolaus into the Christkind and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of the gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions as important, only a few are now offended that the custom of Saint Nicholas is still as closely linked to Martin's day as it is to Martin's singing and Martin's parade.
Today, you can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches by the door and under the Christmas tree.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources confirm a tradition of giving on St. Nicholas Day that goes back to the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a joyful hubbub about who will bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas man, who is essentially a kind of Nikolaus, appears.
This includes his white beard, which has little in common with the more severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Otherwise, buy another e-book #PRS_ORG#.
I searched for a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.
I was told that one would be sent to me.
Since I haven't received one yet (not even in the spam folder), I wanted to ask how long this usually takes.
Many thanks.
Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the royal palace
A gunman was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
The police said that callers had reported a man who had gone into a bank and a bookmaker's with a gun.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was later stopped by officials.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
What then?

The decorative light fits harmoniously into every bed, garden area or stone garden.
The light is simply installed and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.

- The robust plastic extrusion can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: The sun alone ensures that this solar light glows fascinatingly – either in white or in six different colors.
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberate: At night, this modern light object presents itself like a naturally formed large pebble.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he is able to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save a lot of work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires neither a power supply nor batteries.
Set the "illuminating stone" on a popular, sunlit square.
Two delivered sausages provide stability if necessary.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides the "Smart Stone" discreetly in its interior, together with his battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery charges when sunlight falls on the case.
As twilight falls, "Smart Stone" begins to glow of its own accord; you can choose the colour yourself: There are six attractive light colours to choose from – in addition to daylight white.
Finally, the shutdown is automatic as soon as the battery charge drops to a predetermined minimum or it gets light again.
As soon as the sun reappears, the charging cycle begins the next day.
I have done this many times and it does not work.
Shame, I would have liked to have ordered from you again, but if the discount is not credited to me, then I will not order again out of principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.

Pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I'm doing everything right, it's actually my first post after a year on Reddit.
My problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such terrible cramps during my period and PMS before my period.
Now I would rather leave it, because I already take enough medication due to chronic illnesses, which I cannot choose for myself.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten 0 to 100 explosive pimples in my last approximately two-year break and these everywhere.
That was so superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel good.
In the two years of the break, it never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid it this time.
My cosmetics are perfume-free and without noise, but perhaps someone can recommend something to me.
The gynecologist did not take me seriously and the dermatologist's appointment is still pending.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, the love of the skin is such a thing.
Had severe neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then a widespread rash and the acne topic.
During my Christian illness, I have also tried everything possible in terms of nutrition and have remained on a sugar, milk and meat-free mixed diet because nothing else worked so well.
It can also be the case that hormonally the worm is just there, but if you have a building site everywhere, you don't want to go looking for anything else that's wrong.
I had already given everything to their colleague.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was replied to my concern.
I always have to work and answer the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check when the money is there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong
but there is it in general

In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the judge's bench.
But a lot depends on her verdict, even if she is not wearing a robe: jurors decide with professional judges whether and for how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them talk about their time at the Bad Kreuznach district court in conversation with the "Public": Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the John F. Kennedy Strasse district court.
Hello, unfortunately I cannot access the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# to the email address above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no way of keeping them for so long.
We would use the table as if it were ours
I had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it. Therefore, because they are so beautiful, I now have one in grey.
Does the cabinet have to be completely dismantled for removal and reimbursement?
And when would the pickup be?
110-kV-Earth cable to be built in 2022
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision clears the way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning to a mast of the overhead line.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in part.
The blue Betsell number #PRS_ORG# with the sending number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the remark "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the further procedure is now?
A beautiful start to the week!
You can forget that, I have already explained that more than once yesterday!
This is a glass cabinet and all the sides have collapsed, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is damaged
The wardrobe is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the wardrobe cannot be removed because no one is allowed to enter my apartment
Thank you for the message
But why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's with all books, that's why the inquiry at #PRS_ORG, because it's probably a general problem.
Reference: Lesson planning (EK)
Hello dear colleagues and colleagues,
I've been in the Ref since the summer, teaching is fun, but at the moment I have great difficulty planning my lessons in geography in a timely manner.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school, I can only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
At the moment, I simply need a long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently discussing the topic of geofactors, and for me, every hour stands for itself.
In principle, the methods repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I need that time for UBs and so on).
When planning, I always start with the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then consider how I can build this up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied.
That is why the work sheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can show me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG from the order #NUMBER.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG, but I would really like to deal with the return as quickly as possible.
The trade fears for Christmas business due to the 2G rule.
Only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed to enter most businesses.
The trade considers this to be unnecessary and complains about revenue losses.
He also has a possible solution.
From the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are destroying the important Christmas business for retailers.
Stefan Genth, managing director of HDE, criticized a decline in profits at businesses with non-daily items.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit, said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost around a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things are only going well in the grocery sector and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
2G shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic, he stressed.
The current regulations scared customers away and required a high level of personnel.
The bandage rule must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
Afterwards, every customer would only have to be checked for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) once and would have access to all shops with the band received that day.
In addition, in the retail trade - as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - sample checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were at about 75 percent of the pre-corona level without 2G, and sales were at about 90 percent.
These figures will certainly fall in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personal and administrative costs, the centers are trying to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, with which "visitors, for example, can provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to that used in a club hotel, can enter all the shops unimpeded." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG.
The mirror has a chip and the frame also has a fault, which was attempted to be covered with a yellow filler.
That looks unpleasant.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it up and stuck it back in the package.
What should I do now for the return trip?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
The color temperature and brightness of the lamp are controlled by a modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set the color temperature in the range of 3100 to 5650K and save it.
Use the current settings in the flash storage.
A special feature of the controller is its simple and intuitive operation.
The light emits a very high light current with soft light of high quality, completely free of flicker.
The emission angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
In addition, in reporters' situations in small rooms or short distances.
They can adjust the brightness almost without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool for working both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the light in television studios or if the light is installed in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery).
User storage The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, simply press one of the storage buttons for a long time and finished.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practically in studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 is its ability to work with rechargeable batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check the batteries before setting up to see if they have enough performance - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments, a value is shown in the two display screens (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlights with power via the supplied network cable.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
It has a 16mm thread for fixing, so you can attach it directly to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using a level on both sides.
It was important that the mechanical components are extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a swivel is included in the delivery.
The delivery also includes a bag.
This way, you can safely transport or store the light with all the accessories you might want to buy.
Shame, I got it and it's too small :(
The party we wanted to throw away: Frankfurt celebrates after a torrid comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times without a win in a row, the Hessians seemed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga breakdown.
But then the SGE turned it around, shot the frustration of a mediocre season start from their soul within a good hour and won furiously at 5:2. "It is amazing what the boys have achieved today," said trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke of a "general compliment for everyone who was there."
It initially looked like a dampener for the now ranked ninth Frankfurt team, which is still behind its expectations.
Patrik Schick had led Leverkusen 2:0.
What then happened also impressed the SGE coach.
How the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance, Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth match day and his overcoming muscle injury, stressed the morale of his teammates.
I believe our mentality is incredible, said the 27-year-old, delighted with the result, especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, for the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but is well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It is unusual that we have all players fit in December, that all players are in a top physical condition.
It is top-level work in our medical department, but the players also live and work professionally.
Now one wants to "go step by step and remain modest" and to "complete the tasks by the end of the year at this level."
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (8.30pm, Sky).
I'm getting the mail that my package is coming back to you because of a mistake on my part.
I have tried to call #PRS_ORG and redirect it, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and the order is cancelled again?
Unfortunately, for me that would mean that I would not order again because it has already been a long time.
Have you already sat on the #PRS_ORG chairs?
Damper for handball women before quarter final against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slunk off the court after their defeat against Denmark with hanging heads and empty gazes.
At the end of the main round of the World Championships, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat at 16-32 (8-13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face the host nation Spain in the quarter final.
We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent, said national coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game that we have to put out, said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-final, there must be a clear increase against the World Champion of 2019 on Tuesday, in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
We were just not there - neither in attack nor in defense, said back player Xenia Smits, and added: We have to look ahead now.
From front to back not on the level
Unlike the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on top at the start.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and holes in the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The DHB team scored the first goal after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully finished a fast counterattack.
The hoped-for initial spark was not this.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danes, the German women had a hard time setting the scene - and when they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
The game was over at 3-10 after 20 minutes, especially since back player Mia Zschocke saw a red card later due to a hard foul on her opponent.
She is allowed to participate again in the quarter final.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB team started to play better, and by halftime at least five goals were within reach.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone already after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Greens' youngsters sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer improve their performance and went off the court as a clear loser.
DACH Advent calendar day 6: Family traditions at Christmas time
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have obtained the day of St. Nicholas and take this as an opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions in the Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve and Christmas days.
What was that like at home?
How is your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the best for the children?
The Stiefelputzen?
Cookies?
Tree decoration?
Is music played?
Is the Christmas man, the Christ child or is the gift from grandma and grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone gives themselves away and makes an effort to have a nice Christmas as a family.
Whether this is now a fixed tradition, or even something different every year: tell us how it went in your family!
Could you please send me any transaction number... or anything else that could help?
Transfer confirmation... etc
I would like to give away a voucher code.
So with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Do they do that?
The title gives it away: I work as an immunization doctor in mobile immunization teams, in which (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to be completed to a large extent, it will then go to a vaccination center for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, provided they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, will that interfere with the vaccination...").
In my area of responsibility, I am responsible for providing information about the vaccination, the indication (person has a right to a vaccination according to the coronavirus vaccination order and no reasons against it), the medical documentation, and, if necessary, emergency care in the event of allergic reactions (this has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have a pharmacist or pharmaceutical assistant, but "only" (please God, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of vaccines, but they cannot (can they?) carry out vaccinations, so I also carried out most of the vaccinations myself there.
Severe "skinhead" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "swindler"?
With this dialect word, sent in by someone from Amberg, viewers of the BR television show "Wir in Bayern" were prompted to think hard.
But, unlike on many previous days, the term "Host mi?" remained a mystery to the callers this time.
No, it was not "a person who is nervous."
And no one, "who has to do everything quickly."
That, people heard from the TV presenter, is completely wrong.
On which the man from Amberg announced the solution and thus probably also surprised many people in Upper Palatinate.
The audience learned that "the huckster" is "a rag that someone uses to wipe the stove."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert by Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the rather well-known dialect word "Houdern".
With which a gap in education was closed - probably also for many who have been living in Amberg for a long time.
I have not been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have started, connected, synchronized and repaired the #PRS_ORG#.
Nothing has helped.
Is the choice of tires on a racing bike really so safe?
This morning, I woke up full of energy because I wanted to train at least a little for my bike tour next week.
Said, done, and I went with my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40 km were really beautiful - but then that happened, which lurks in every city centre (this time: thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud snapping and my rear tire did not want to participate in the rest of the track.
Since I had no real possibility of getting a replacement coat and hose on a weekday, I had to turn around and take the first train home.
Then it was not quite so bad, perhaps it is even better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike tour.
But now I have a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long stretch ahead of me over several days, I would be extremely unhappy to get this problem more often.
It was not so bad now, because the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who drove until 2 p.m. 120 km on the day I picked up the bike) and he also described them as suboptimal, because he drove on them for years.
But if I think about the fact that I have to change a tire after 80 to 90 km, then I am really in a bad mood:D
Now I'm talking to an older man at the platform, who asked me why I didn't have the marathon plus tyres; these are supposed to be unplatable.
Now, of course, it all sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I don't really want to spend 40 euros on new tires only to be disappointed.
In addition, I ask myself: I am currently cycling at 25x622.
There are also (apparently) wider Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority are wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend other tires for a racing bike?
The swallow page seems to be my absolute! Do you recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and loving greetings!

After the publication of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new talent.
SOLO 15 is the new offshoot and is reminiscent of the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM, optically.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitable footrest is included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted accordingly to the circumstances at home.
Principally, the SOLO 15 is very well suited to people for whom the maximum sound level plays only a rather subordinate role, but it should achieve an exceptionally high sound quality.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to generate nearly unfiltered sound pressure levels of this magnitude.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and extremely impressive for her size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-end rise.
This is common practice for broadband providers to optimize the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is precisely aimed at the listening position and convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
The treble range can be slightly turned outwards to reduce it and thus warm up the sound image.
Thanks to the point source, the location of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is incredibly sharp and precise.
The suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM create a hostile dynamic that seeks its equal.
The SOLO 15 is not only an addition to our SOLO series, but also extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our construction kits, it is recommended to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning, so that appropriate changes can be planned during construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the housing, the lowering of the speaker must be adapted accordingly, as the veneer adds more material.
After all the plates were cut to size (e.g. at the hardware store), the first thing to do was to drill a 8 mm hole in the floor board in the appropriate place, so that the cable could be led through it later without any problems.
With the help of a jig saw, the speaker opening in the front is now following, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase to design the opening area of the speaker chassis as large as possible.
The four connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
After that, the actual construction of the box begins, with one of the two side walls being placed on a flat surface.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now glued on.
The three reinforcements should also be installed and glued.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in thickness if necessary, for example, if you want to use prefabricated beams from the DIY store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be installed.
After that, all the plates of the feet, i.e. the two sides and the front, follow.
Using a suitable hole saw or a Forstner drill, the installation of the openings of the bass reflex speaker, as well as the connection clip on the back wall, is facilitated.
Finally, a round router is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footrest can also be rounded off.
The bottom plate is then glued firmly to the case and additionally screwed in with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points on the speaker chassis and the connector clamp.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (absorb / blow off), the cable is laid.
It is easiest to achieve this through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
To do this, the entire and uncut cable is pushed through the 8 mm hole in the foot until the terminal opening, and it is left to hang there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and is also allowed to hang loosely there.
The frequency switch is then prepared and used.
The construction plan for the frequency changer, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be obtained from the following document: Installation instructions Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
With the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and a little skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
According to the description, now follows the dampening.
Next, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and tightened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus lead (marked cable) must be connected to the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
The damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept open.
Can I cancel my order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will once again hold the OSCAST this year!
Due to known reasons, we are unfortunately not able to get more than four people into the studio, which requires more planning and explains the short notice of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per shift, so that we can follow the Oscars 2021 with at least seven beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - so we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Get your drinks cold, plan good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
