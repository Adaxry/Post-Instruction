浙大学术年会上, students took the lead, and the research results opened the students' minds - Xinhua
Use air to wash hands, sniff to judge diseases, and precisely search for sources of haze. Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Year of Zhejiang University, a series of brilliant academic achievements were praised.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. The research covers a wide range of fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life science, and humanities education. From a curious idea, students have created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have been awarded domestically and internationally.
Biological sensor: Your family doctor
Dr. Zhang Di Ming, a PhD student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smart phone-based bio sensor on the spot. It is only half the size of a smart phone.
You only need to breathe lightly, and this set of instruments can detect the health condition from the gas composition you breathe out.
Zhang Di Ming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to smart phones, and when the gas is called out, the health report will be shown on the phone.
In the market, smart wristbands that can test health conditions generally test physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This bio-sensor uses graphene, a new material, to target chemical elements. Its "smell" is sensitive, allowing it to reflect health more accurately and deeply.
Intelligent surgery light: The doctor's high energy eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart surgery lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition in Switzerland this year.
The team of PhD student Zhu Linping and Xu Junfei from the School of Optoelectronics and Engineering opened a new idea in the shortcomings of traditional surgery lights and invented an intelligent LED surgery invisible light.
Many diseases cannot be detected early and removed at an early stage, which is related to the light in the operating room used by doctors.
For example, when the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in time during the early cancer examination, the cancer cells will still spread, said Sejunfei.
This intelligent surgery light has four light plates, and through the adjustment of the spectrum, it can enhance the distinction between different tissues under the light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and invisibility of the light spot according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This intelligent surgery light has been tested in the affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Use air to wash hands: save water and cool
For ordinary people, washing their hands with water is enough, and they can only use soap and hand sanitizer to clean their hands. However, some students, such as Li Zhengang, have invented an "air hand sanitizer".
As long as we stand on the device, our weight can compress the air.
It is like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
So, we can wash our hands cleanly! "
The visible reaction and bacterial residue test prove that the effect of this method is the same as that of the ordinary hand washing method.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, so it can guarantee the cleanliness and save 90% of the water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
In the second Global Major Challenges Summit last year, this invention stood out in many world-class universities and won the only gold award.

A certificate that is meaningful to you - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the skills certificates I think is important besides driving license!
普及一下： emergency measures are actually emergency rescue when there is a sudden incident. That is, emergency rescue before the arrival of the ambulance.
It is well known that there is still a certain period after the ambulance arrives after the accident. It is precisely this period that is most important.
At this time, emergency treatment is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, stroke, and sudden death, our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So, everyone knows how important it is to know how to perform CPR.
When we have someone fall down, we can rescue him through professional knowledge, rather than just stand there and do nothing, which is so helpless.
In China, we have 300 million accidental deaths every year, and the most dangerous is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the average is 15%.
In Las Vegas casinos and hotels, 70% can be saved, and Shanghai and Beijing are below 1%."
This is what founder Lu Le said.
If a person has a heart attack, the breath is gone, the heartbeat is gone, and you have no effect on the person by pressing the人中.
It is impossible to save the person by performing artificial respiration and chest compressions.
I found that very few people will have such consciousness to learn CPR, but it is too late when things happen, so I still urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can react in time when facing emergencies.
Maybe it can save someone's life!
The emergency permit can be applied for at your local Red Cross training center. I applied at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. There is also a discount for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals that need to be completed before 25, and adding the emergency permit to the list of goals is a few months ago, but it is really done!
Next, we need to take other certificates that we want to take. We plan to take a scuba diving certificate. I saw on the small red book that there is a scuba diving rescue certificate. To take this certificate, you need to have a rescue certificate. So in fact, a rescue certificate is very useful!

First of all, I would like to come to a conclusion. In my opinion, "Sea of Thieves" is a bad film in all aspects.
But if you say that the movie is not a highlight, that is not true at least the score is good.
There are many kinds of bad films, some of which can make you fall asleep in the cinema, and some of which can make you furious after watching. For the audience, "四海" is like a monkey on Mount Emei, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In the matter of insulting the audience, Han Jin is truly gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation of Ko's novels, difficult to describe and with many holes like the coat of wind on Xiao Ma.
Even after watching it, you will doubt whether there is a hidden metaphor in it, but when you think carefully, you will find that it is actually a lump of shit.
First, let's talk about some of the difficult scenes I can't understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south of the country, and live with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and the plot was arranged for a big uncle to drive a small面包 car to take her to the north to see snow.
The elderly man sat on a bread truck from south to north to see snow?
He and his father are very confident.
Then the old man lost his way.
To open a hotel on the abandoned ship, how does the woman’s brother get the business license?
Why can the island gangster easily finish a mountain road?
Then, the truck that delivers钢筋 to the middle of the road stops at the edge of the road and the truck driver can't be found.
This effect is too obvious.
Why did the gangster who had a bad credit and suspected of violating the law become a police assistant?
Why did the policeman not call the police in the movie?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to open a door with a key card in a hotel, and is forced to sleep in the doorway for a night?
This inexplicable situation is full of the whole film. Because the situation is too strange, I will feel painful when I recall it.
In addition to the plot, the worst thing is the movie's theme, or that the movie has no theme at all, but a hideous stitch-up monster.
At the beginning of the film, you may think he wants to make a comedy film, and then you may think it may be a motivational film, and when you watch half of it, you may think it may be a film that reflects the hardships of the small-town youth, and when you finish watching, you don't know what you have watched at all, and then you have deep doubts about yourself. Why do we have to go to the cinema to enjoy the excrement during the New Year?
For most people, in fact, they are very familiar with the tropes of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcycle driver, you have to be ambitious + comedy and tell the audience a talented rookie how to achieve success.
If you want to make a love film, you have to tell the story of the love between the small-town youth who likes to ride motorcycles and the waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot should not present something contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that尹正 played was just burnt, and he could still sing the role)
As for the main character, who is clearly not mentally retarded, she can act like a five-year-old in some aspects. I don't know if this is due to acting or the director's requirements.
There is also one thing I don't understand, why is it so hot to add car crashes in his own movie as a racing driver?
Such a movie arrangement is in the Spring Festival, is it to make the audience frustrated?

The inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment of Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment characteristics and advantages:
The inspection well brick machine equipment is widely applicable to the new type of brick materials for the underground construction of municipalities such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
For example: drainage, water storage facilities such as inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, sewage tanks and small structures, and bridge wing walls.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the four sides of the modules are凹凸 structure, and the combination of the modules forms a chain.
The shear strength of the wall of the well is far better than that of the flat friction brick.
The module is a hollow structure. When it is assembled, the vertical holes are connected and the horizontal holes are continuous. After the core of the hole is cast, a concrete mesh structure is formed, which has a secondary reinforcement and waterproof effect.
The module is equipped with a groove, and the vertical and horizontal stirrups are correspondingly increased to improve the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the concrete inspection well module used to build inspection wells and drainage wells is not prone to collapse, subsidence, leakage and other phenomena. The mechanical performance of the well wall module is stable, the operation is simple, and the molding size is standardized.

Chongqing Vocational Secondary School Pilot Modern Apprentice System, Enterprise Apprentice - Xinhua
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Department of Education that starting from this year, 60 middle and secondary schools will pilot the talent training mode of "modern apprenticeship system", and the students who will be trained will have the status of apprentice at the same time. After enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as unit employees by the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Committee requires that the enrollment and admission of vocational schools be standardized, and that the apprentice be clearly identified as a student in a vocational school and a trainee in a company. According to the principle of two-way choice, the apprentice, the school and the company should sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who are 16 years old but less than 18 years old, the apprentice, his guardian, the school and the company should sign a four-party agreement to determine the rights and interests of all parties, as well as the specific positions, teaching contents, and rights and interests of apprentices in the company.
The pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and cooperate with the enterprises to carry out the pre-employment training and the job rotation training for the enterprise employees.
The pilot schools should reform the talent cultivation mode.
The school and enterprise jointly design talent training programs, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot adopts a pilot cycle to cultivate students. The internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent cultivation program. The on-the-job internship is generally 6 months.
In the enterprise practice, the enterprise teamwork management model should be implemented, and according to the characteristics of different majors, one master can teach 2-5 disciples, forming a learning group to ensure that the students master the skills required for each training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city will determine 60 municipal middle and secondary school modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with a total of about 500 students (apprentices) being trained.
According to the principle of pilot first and then implement, from point to point, explore and establish a long-term mechanism of joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education between universities and enterprises, so as to effectively improve the job skills of students and improve the employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: OMICRON has a strong transmission, but most are mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Covid 19 Omicron variant are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although the transmission speed is faster.
According to the Associated Press, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in a medical organization in Gauteng, South Africa, reported that the symptoms of the coronavirus patients they treated were relatively mild, such as body pain and cough, similar to the flu.
Dr. Ben Pillay, the organization's director, said he sees dozens of patients a day, but none are in hospital.
Pi Li said: "They can control the disease at home. Most people recover within 10-14 days of isolation."
He said that it includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to fall into a critical condition due to coronavirus infection.
Compared with it, in the previous wave of Delta epidemic, he treated the new coronavirus patients, "breathed difficultly, and the oxygen level was low," he said.
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.
In the two weeks after the first report of the Omushegan variant in South Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although collecting enough data will take several weeks, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30% of the patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 had serious illnesses, half of the proportion of severe illnesses in the previous wave; the average hospitalization time was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent COVID-19 patients died, and the death ratio in the early outbreak of COVID-19 in South Africa was 20%.
The head of the African Health Institute, Willem Hanekom, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports as follows: "At present, almost all signs indicate that it is a mild disease."
He added: "Now it's early, we still need late data.
In general, the time of hospitalization and death is later, and we entered this wave of epidemic only for two weeks. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the main new coronavirus strain in the world, outbreaks have appeared in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicenter.
According to health officials, the number of new cases in Hertfordshire increased by 400% in the first week of December, and the tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were of the Oxford variant.
Thank you to today’s supporters, 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education commentary: What should we do to save the children who have been abducted?
Compared with the famous publicity slogan "Without trading, there is no murder", in a good environment where there is no demand for "trafficking", collective self-defence and public anti-trafficking will make it unprofitable, high-risk and high-cost for traffickers to operate.
Recently, the Children's Missing Information Emergency Release Platform of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has been launched.
This is an Internet information platform for the establishment of an authority channel for the release of information on the disappearance of children and the prompt recovery of children who have been abducted.
After hearing the name of the App, I felt a lot of warmth.
The new technology means not only have the name of "art" and full of feelings, but also the use of information is appropriate and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement against human trafficking is to find the children who have been trafficked and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "great" words.
However, before the trafficking case is broken, it is necessary to prioritize the safety of the victim.
It is a matter of weighing the importance and urgency. Under the urgent purpose of "search and rescue," such topics such as "whether the sale of children should be sentenced to death" are controversial and disputed. They can be put aside for careful discussion, but the rescue of abused children cannot wait.
According to the experience of the investigation of such cases, human traffickers are habitually away from the scene of the crime as soon as possible after the success.
Every minute of delay in the operation will delay the child by one step, and the difficulty of the case will increase by one point.
In this case, taking out effective measures such as the "Union" platform, which directly helps to solve the case and find the child, is indeed a pragmatic action.
In fact, "trafficking" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
To fight crime and safeguard the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the guarantee of judicial protection and the careful implementation of law enforcement, it is necessary to implement the concept of "guarding children and helping weak people".
In addition, the prevention of trafficking in children can also be done better from the family to the society.
For example, a common case is that a family of three was resting at the station. The parents were sleeping and woke up to find that their child had disappeared.
It is not possible to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, at least he should have a certain level of protection awareness.
It is the minimum means to prevent children being abducted.
From the other side of the police to fight against human trafficking, the buyer of the trafficked children should also be concerned and punished.
One single illegal act often plays a part in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of China, the minimum sentence for the crime of trafficking in children is 5 years. If the crime is particularly serious, it can be to death, and the property can be confiscated.
The maximum penalty is high, and the minimum penalty is low. Under the trend of "light punishment", the crime of trafficking in children is obviously more serious than other crimes.
There are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people have an outdated concept of raising children and a weak legal awareness.
The legal education for this group should be synchronized.
To effectively control human trafficking crimes, it is not enough to strictly enforce the law.
If the market for trafficking in children exists widely, the traffickers will be greedy and constantly innovate the means of trafficking in children to form a situation of "fighting with law enforcement officials", and the anti-trafficking operation will inevitably fall into a low efficiency muddle.
Therefore, breaking the backward concepts, popularizing the law knowledge, and also helps to root out the sale and purchase of children.
Yang Hongdong promulgated the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress and the 19th National Party Congress in Macao
汲取奋进力量
Hunan Daily (all-media reporter Gong Bowei) According to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, Mr. Yang Hongdong, deputy secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and the press secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, gave an interactive speech on the morning of December 10 in the video creative park in Changsha.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil. There are five grades.
初榨橄榄油, also known as natural olive oil, is obtained by mechanical cold pressing, filtration and other treatments after removing impurities from freshly picked olives.
According to the different degrees of acidity, it is divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Extra Virgin Olive Oil): It is the highest grade and quality, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a pleasant plant fragrance, and the acidity is not more than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: The acidity is slightly higher, but not more than 2%, and the taste is pure and fragrant.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil (Ordinary Virgin): The taste and flavor are acceptable, the acidity is not more than 3.3%.
The refined olive oil refers to the refined olive oil after the acidity exceeds 3.3%, or the "二次 oil".
The refined olive oil is divided into two levels:
Olive oil: refined olive oil and a certain proportion of virgin olive oil are mixed to balance the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5% and a transparent golden yellow color.
Refined Olive Pomace Oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): Olive oil obtained by dissolving the pomace and refining.
You have probably noticed that the acidity of olive oil is an important indicator.
You should know that olives are like grapes when it comes to making wine. Olives from different regions and different olive varieties will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best growing place of olive:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for the growth of olive trees.
In addition to the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be planted sparsely in suitable areas.
Major production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, there are also Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and so on, which are similar to the climate.
The month of olive harvest:
From March to June every year, olive trees bloom and fruit set. From July to October, fruit begins to develop and mature. The fruit changes from green to red, purple, and finally black.
From November to February next year is the harvest season (freshness is important for olive oil).
The nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, including oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the best oil for human nutrition to date.
Democratic summit ends, Biden says the torch of freedom will never be extinguished
The online "Democracy Summit" convened by the President of the United States, Joe Biden, with the participation of leaders from 110 countries of governments and civil society and the private sector closed on Friday (December 10).
In his closing speech, Biden said that the torch of freedom was burning in the hearts of all people around the world, and the tyranny regime could never extinguish it.
He also said that the plan is to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwan government representative and政务委员唐凤和, who is currently in exile in Britain, also made a speech at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know the work before us is so difficult.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because I have said before that as this summit has shown, the world of democracy is everywhere.
專制政權永遠無法熄滅自由的微火，它在全世界和世界各地人們的心中燃燒。 ”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said: "As the leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reform, and realize transparent accountability governance, which can better resist the buffer and impact of the power of the authoritarianism and those who want to pursue power in front of the public interest. "
The theme of the "Democratic Summit" on the second day was to uphold human rights, consolidate democracy and oppose authoritarianism, and to counteract digital authoritarianism and affirm the value of democracy.
This day coincides with the "International Human Rights Day".
In his opening speech on the same day, UN Secretary-General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially the challenges brought about by new digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions and the resilience of democracy.
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving the problems of inequality, fighting against corruption, updating the social contract, investing in high-quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technology revolution. "
Through a pre-recorded video, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Law Chi-kwong reminded the participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and other Chinese minorities such as Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Rogers also called on the free world to unite against the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: “Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don’t want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you haven’t recognized (the Communist Party)’s threat to our democratic values.
That's why we failed.
This is also the reason we must change. "
In his speech at the round-table discussion on “fighting against digital dictatorship and affirming the value of democracy”, Taiwan’s Office of the President’s Council of Advisors on National Affairs (OPNA) issued the “State Declaration” through video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of fighting against tyranny and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience in how to fight the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we have always been firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the pandemic, various authoritarian governments around the world have rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests. Global democracy is showing signs of retreat.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to close the city to control the epidemic, and we do not have to lower the shelf to defeat fake information. "
At the same time as the agenda of the "Democratic Summit" on the second day, the US Treasury announced the imposition of sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea and other countries, as well as the imposition of investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was identified as using surveillance technology to violate human rights.

Hello, the restaurant's hot chicken is raw
I want to try tennis, but I am afraid of not being able to stick to it. So I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price often correlates with the degree of friendliness, and if you can't distinguish, the more expensive normal situation is more friendly than the cheaper beat, which is actually industrial waste.
They are very weak, the ball hits the top of the bat, the vibration is very big, hard balls cannot withstand, and high players are difficult to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence are that tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn, and you know you can't afford to buy expensive, so you make a cheap copy to trick you, and you play two times, so you won't play again. In this way, the price is low, and you don't care.
When you can really distinguish good and bad, it means that you have progressed, and come here to buy the expensive, I will make two times of money.
It is suggested to buy a second-hand good one for a similar price, choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough, so a good one cannot be sold at a price. A new one costs 500 to 600 yuan, and a second-hand one costs 200 yuan. Do you not enjoy the experience of owning a thousand yuan one?
It is friendly to beginners, but after the beginner stage, it becomes a waste of money. However, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the beginner stage.
The order has been delayed several times.
Can you help me follow up?
Delay
Thank you
That is, I actually have credit?
Do I need to order again? Didn't that order not matter?

In fact, there are many things to consider when dressing for a woman with slight body fat.
Girls who are fat should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length should be about knee length. Just enough to cover the fat part of the thigh.
If the skirt is too short, the leg fat will be exposed.
Too long will make you feel short and fat.
If you wear it in three parts, it will make you naturally taller, and the colors of the top, the skirt and the stockings are different, it will make you feel that you are tall.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for thin girls (the author has deep experience), and dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat. A noble and elegant black skirt is also the preferred choice for thin girls.
Wearing dark clothes, especially black skirts, will make you feel slimmer.
If your calves are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too much.
The more popular the better, and the color should not be too bright.
In order to prevent people from paying attention to your legs and feet, so that they feel fat.
For slightly obese girls, it is necessary to talk about the key to dressing.
Girls who are not thin should not wear tight skirts, and the tops should not be too short or stuck in the skirts, which will make people feel uncomfortable. If the girl's legs are big, she should wear black socks or mesh socks (the kind with fine lines), choose a soft print peplum skirt, and match it with a collared shirt to hide her shortcomings.
Of course, there are also some rules for wearing a short skirt for a petite girl.
Girls who are fat should wear skirts, and should choose tops that match the color of the skirts. This will make your fat body appear taller.
Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs appear longer, which is the most IN summer outfit!
If you are a person who is fat on the top but has thin legs, it is recommended to choose a short dress.
It not only covers the belly, but also shows your advantages.
An A-line skirt will make you look slimmer, which is more suitable for fat girls. The top should be tight, so as to form layers, which will make you look slimmer.
Simple white T-shirt paired with short skirt, overweight women can also try.
The thin girl can also wear fashionable clothes.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing, then the slim girls will also be the focus of attention.
After making changes in dressing, it is also necessary to exercise more in life, so that we can get rid of the label of a little fat girl as soon as possible😄

Girl becomes target for sister to raise money: "When you think about it, it's nothing - Xinhua
In Hangzhou, a girl stood in front of a big wooden board with the words "man meat target, 10 yuan shot" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou Girl Gave Up as a 'Target' for Sisters to Donate" went viral on Weibo.
The photo shows that a girl stands in front of a big wooden board in Wulin Square, Hangzhou, with the words "man meat target, 10 yuan arrow" on it, indicating that people can shoot arrows after paying.
The behavior triggered heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the person in charge of publicity of the police sub-division of Yicheng District, Hangzhou City, confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed the girl was the sister who made such extreme actions after she raised money, but such actions are not worth promoting. After advice, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girls on the streets of the "arrow target" for donations
In the photo leaked online, a girl with long hair stands in the shape of a “” in front of a big wooden board. On the wooden board written in black ink, there are the words “human meat targets, 10 yuan a bow”. There is another wooden board with her bank account and WeChat, Alipay account.
The photo went viral after it was posted online.
Some netizens believed that this was a "scam to attract eyebrows", while many netizens expressed sympathies.
We found the situation at around 10 a.m. on the morning of the 23rd. At that time, there were a lot of spectators.
When interviewed by local media, the police in天水派出所 said that there were only two girls who were 20 years old and looked young.
Among them, the girl who played as a "human target" kept crying, asking passersby to play the game; another girl helped yelling at the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and needed surgery, please everyone to help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting funds for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the person in charge of publicity of the police sub-division of Yicheng District, Hangzhou, told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Jijali, and she was collecting donations for her sister Jijiayi.
However, because the treatment still needs more than 30,000 yuan, it was not easy to find a good way to raise funds at first.
He said that in the whole process, the two girls were both the target and the assistant, but they did not participate in it. No one shot arrows in the whole process, and only someone watched and took photos and posted them on Twitter.
After the police checked with the public security department, it was determined that the arrows used were not within the scope of control.
The person in charge said, "It is not recommended to adopt this eye-catching fundraising method."
After being warned by the public security station, she has left the public security station.
Thermal effect: good, light, convenient, satisfied

What is the most popular in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympic Games.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
There was a very popular article, "Quick! Project Managers Can Impact the Gold at the Olympic Games", which mentioned that project managers are absolutely able to take the lead in many projects, no one can match: Construction, travel, and staying up late are the daily routine of project managers, and firefighting, blaming, and apologizing are nothing.
Although it seems to be a joke, it also reveals the daily hardships of project managers. Behind it is the inability to cope with the current project management work.
Those who work in project management are also gradually choosing some actions to get rid of their work problems.
From the number of applicants for the PMP (Professional Certification in Project Management), which is on the rise every year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management skills.
According to the "Report on the Development of Project Management in China (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® applicants in China was nearly 600,000, and about 420,000 people passed the PMP® certification, accounting for about 300,000 effective PMP® holders, accounting for about 31.2% of the total global PMP® holders.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers have realized that relying on simple "old experience" to do things is no longer acceptable. The ever-changing work environment tells us to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can PMP guarantee project management smoothly?
Many project management beginners said that by learning the relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten areas and five process groups related to project management, but when they actually do the project management work, they are still a little confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following questions: Project management knowledge is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, only have project management theories, do not know how to practice; There is no systematic project management process system support in the work, the project cannot be implemented in the work, the project estimate is not accurate, the controllability and sensitivities are poor, the project is dragged and dragged; Members are not clearly divided into work, the "old oil" in the team do not know how to deal with; The communication between departments is not smooth, the project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and research and development management for more than 10 years, it has helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other key research and development personnel, and has obtained the honorary titles of "China Enterprise Research and Development Management Talents Training Demonstration Base" and so on.
The online course of "Project Manager Special Training Course" This is a way of online fragmented learning. It combines the practical cases and tools of many development-oriented enterprises to help you master the essential knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and take the advanced road of project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and fewer inputs to promote the training process of project managers and bring more efficient operation results to enterprises.
Without any evidence, we can first see how other students evaluate this course: This course is not only taught by the China Tianhong expert team (the former Huawei R&D management team), but also combined with the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenes of many well-known enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich templates and forms, and help students apply the learning content after class.

Jicai advocates rational consumption ahead of the “Double 12” - Economic Observer - a professional economic news website
This year, the total transaction amount of online payment business during the “Double 11” festival reached 157 billion yuan, a new record high compared with previous years.
Variously priced discount coupons, eye-catching live shopping, and the consumer boom once again made consumers shout out that they had benefited. On the one hand, the consumer boom made people sigh that the national consumer power was becoming stronger, but on the other hand, it was necessary to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the “Double 12”, China Everbright Financial Services Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “China Everbright”) issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the general users, especially the young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and to refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Overall, the performance of Chinese residents in the financial consumption level is better, but there are still great differences in the aspects of financial behavior and skills. It is still necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The level of financial literacy of the elderly and the young is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will still remain the focus of financial education; Nielsen's "Report on the Debt Situation of Chinese Young People" and CCTV's "Report on the Consumption of Chinese Young People in 2019 - 2020" show that the young generation has great potential for consumption. Credit consumption has become an important means for consumption upgrading. 86.6% of the young people are using credit products. Nearly half of the young people have no debt accumulation. Although the young generation overall shows a trend of rational consumption, it is quite different from the "over-expenditure" label attached by the outside world. Some young people actually have over-expenditure and follow-the-move consumption behaviors, which have resulted in large financial pressure and debt risks, and even cause social problems to gradually increase. Financial enterprises should take on social responsibility and do positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Everbright has always been committed to helping the masses build their own happy lives by providing high-quality and attentive services. It advocates consumers to establish a sound consumption concept and actively responds to the regulatory call to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people.

Vietnamese People's Daily - Gulf Cooperation Council should face common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stopover includes Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first time Prince Mohammed, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies have imposed a blockade on Qatar since the Gulf crisis in 2017.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive blockade on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations while having close relations with Iran.
The diplomatic tension has seriously affected the internal unity of the Hashemite Kingdom, and has had a negative impact on the economy of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, and the countries of the Gulf signed an agreement to move towards "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened the border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are trying to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of a new ambassador in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab countries resolved their differences to restore relations with Qatar in the interests of all countries and regional stability. It is aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct road link between the two Gulf countries.
The long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel and integration of the supply chain of the two countries.
Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $500 million in Oman, and two countries' enterprises signed 13 cooperative memoranda worth $300 billion.
The visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to the Gulf countries coincides with the negotiations between Iran and the world major powers on a plan to save the Iranian nuclear agreement, named Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which the Gulf countries have condemned for failing to resolve the Iranian missile issue.
All the Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and regarded Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
All the Gulf countries believe that it is defective not to solve the Iranian missile problem and not to take actions to curb Iran's activities in the region.
Under the background that the nuclear negotiations between the major countries and Iran failed to meet the wishes of the countries in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted direct negotiations.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of the tense situation in the region.
This is one of the factors that slow down the growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first since the end of some member states' disputes with Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-assess the contribution of diplomatic achievements to the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and propose measures to fully cooperate with its member countries to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is said that the exhaust sound of the super car is the largest!
This car is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship super car, Murcielago's successor model - Aventador LP700-4!
The price is close to RMB 200,000, and the annual road tax is RMB 10,000. Four-wheel drive, why is the LP700 called?
Because of its 700 horsepower, how fast can you imagine?
That's OK, I don't know. According to the data, the acceleration from 0 to 100 km / h takes only 2.9 seconds, which is about when my vi reached 30 km / h, he reached 100 km / h.
The low, narrow body, the arrogant blade door, the huge intake around the body, and the transparent 6.5 v12 engine under the glass, perfectly interpreted the style of Lamborghini.
For the explanation of the price, you don't need to say too much, you can Google it yourself, and the editor has collected some Google may not give the explanation!
Too much attention, where to go everyone is watching, it is not easy!
The cost of 1km of oil is about RM1 (the owner does not care)
Practice getting on and off the bus, otherwise it will be awkward (because you can't get out of the bus and get stuck halfway).
The engine sound was too loud, and I suddenly became deaf after getting off the car. (But it was still very enjoyable)
The car is too big, and it will be too narrow to park in a normal parking space. I am afraid of being hit by the neighbor's car when it opens the door!
I am a little lonely because there is no competitor on the road (I myself said, it is not related to the owner, hahaha)
Please do not misunderstand, the super car in this video is not for sale. Sorry!
If you want to take a video of your car, please contact us!

It involves a car accident worth millions!
The Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are familiar to car lovers, Chiron is one of the most expensive super cars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
Just a few minutes ago, there was a collision of more than 100,000 cars, including the Porsche 911 and the Lamborghini Chiron!
See the result, it is reasonable!
Let the spirit of universities resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and values that have been accumulated over time in the development process of a university. It is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to today, the university spirit has been of great significance to the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the first modern university in the world, the university has assumed a unique mission different from other social organizations. For colleges and universities in China, founded in the autumn of national crisis, its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the impact of the times. The value concept of "well-educating the world" and the patriotism of "promoting the country" are advocated.
At present, the trend of higher education informationization and internationalization is increasingly obvious, and the global education competition, scientific and technological competition and talent competition are constantly intensifying. As an important “supply-side”, the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the "General Plan for统筹推进世界一流大学和一流学科建设" shows China's confidence and determination to move from a large country of higher education to a powerful country of higher education. At the same time, it also raises higher and更新的 requirements for the development of universities.
How can we work hard to enter the world's top list within a short period of time, and accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines, so as to achieve "overtake the curve"?
In addition to firm goals, self-confidence, path self-confidence and ability self-confidence, colleges and universities should give full play to three advantages: first, the advantage of late development, through continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learning and borrowing the advanced experience of world-class universities, so as to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and quality of education; second, the advantage of culture, inherit the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over 5,000 years, and promote the development of excellent traditional Chinese culture, so as to gather strength, build a brand and enhance the image; third, the advantage of the system, give full play to the superiority of the system in a socialist country, strengthen the drive of goals, gather consensus and optimize resource allocation, so as to provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate the pace of catching up with the world's advanced level.
It is particularly important to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university in a uniform way. At the same time, each school must show its personality and characteristics while playing its advantages.
The characteristics of the school should not only have the common characteristics of Chinese characteristics, but also reflect its unique target positioning, educational tradition and resources.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we emphasize the following three aspects in our education: First, we emphasize the innovation and entrepreneurship talent cultivation, build an integrated educational environment combining science and education, and form a full-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem. Second, we emphasize the special characteristics of cross-disciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, and create a disciplinary institutional environment. Third, we emphasize the characteristics of the educational system and social service, and carry out in-depth international exchange and cooperation, so as to accelerate the formation of the industrial and academic cooperation system of Zhejiang University.
In this process, it is especially important to always uphold the university spirit, so that the university spirit resonates with the times.
For the University of Zhejiang, the university motto, the common values such as "studying hard, cultivating virtue, distinguishing clearly, and acting sincerely" and the common values such as "纳江河, enlightenment and virtue, opening up the people, and building my country" constitute the latest expression system of the University of Zhejiang's spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct educational direction and constantly accumulate cultural heights and strengthen the spirit. It has rich connotation and profound significance.
Among them, "Henan Jiang River" emphasizes openness and inclusiveness, reflects the spirit of "using all the world's talents for me", and manifests the quality of the excellent ideas in the world famous universities; "Opening up and cultivating virtue" emphasizes the pursuit of truth to the best spirit, which means that the university should not only seek knowledge and innovation, but also embody the cultivation of virtue and personality through reform and innovation; "Opening up the country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, and talks about the university should always work together with the national destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of the University of Zhejiang for 120 years.
"Smart people listen to the silent, and bright people see the invisible."
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the current situation and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, we must uphold humanism and independence and let the university spirit and the time spirit and the national spirit interact, so as to provide an endless impetus for realizing national prosperity and national revitalization and realizing the common ideals of mankind.

At the moment when NFT is out of the circle, a new concept has emerged in the cryptocurrency community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia. Some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic started to get stable income in this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet cultivation game based on blockchain technology. It brings together a variety of play modes, including NFTs, and is currently the highest trading volume NFT project, with more than 30 billion US dollars.
TokenTerminal data show that Axie Infinity's daily income exceeded 8.2 million US dollars, approaching the income of "Super League".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity announced that its daily active users exceeded 100,000.
The fever of "Axie Infinity" will transmit a new "palytoearn" mode to more people, and through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players will no longer be a single role, but can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by game makers, but by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest impression is that the company's choice of the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry, first chooses the industries with large growth space, at least 100 billion market size; second, choose the industries with good growth prospects in the future, and consider the industries with the best growth prospects in the next three to five years; finally, choose the industries with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market scale, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, the flatness of the track refers to the competition pattern of the industry.

The key is "do the things right", which is to do things correctly.
The strategy is "do the right thing", which is to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find the direction, and the tactical is to land. On top of most tactical thinking, there is space for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can think about whether to continue deepening in the current field or extend to the horizontal field (strategic thinking); how to increase customer retention rate (tactical thinking), one can think about how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers; how to improve the participation rate of target customers, activate high-value silent customers, and precisely attract new customers; how to improve the DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.

Asian-American groups complain of discrimination at 3 Ivy League universities - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian groups submitted an appeal to the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice on the 23rd to protest three Ivy League universities — — Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College during the admission process.
The Asian Education Alliance, which led the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yuxian, the chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the requirements of American universities has grown exponentially, but in these three American universities, the proportion of Asian applicants has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies show that these universities in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" recruitment process, "long-term sustainability and systematic discrimination of Asian applicants".
Zhao Yuxing introduced that, in 2014, the study by Sanders and other scholars showed that among these three universities, the proportion of Asian students was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
The US Department of Education's data also show that among all Ivy League universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest proportion of admissions to Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have actually implemented racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yu空 told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they expect the US Department of Education and the US Department of Justice to launch an investigation after the appeal is submitted and take measures to stop these colleges and universities from discriminating against Asian students after they have identified the facts.
They also expect that the universities that are being criticized will take the initiative to address this issue and change their admissions policies for Asian students.
At present, three universities have not responded to the complaint.
The Asian Education Alliance was founded in 2015. At that time, it had complained about Harvard University's admissions discrimination, but the US Department of Education declined to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the American Chinese groups participating in the appeal, there are also American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a real estate broker that a factory was located in Yiyang Ruitang Town, Zhejiang Province. After several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In the same month of December, Mr. Lu negotiated with Mr. Lin, the family of the real estate owner, and paid 20,000 yuan as a deposit via bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed on the "Bill of Deposit" on the "Bill of Deposit", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, this deposit belongs to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller. Both parties agreed to sign the factory purchase contract within a week."
However, after the two sides failed to reach a consensus on major contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment methods, the house sale contract could not be signed.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the content of the contract, Mr. Lin returned the 20,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later.
It was hard to find a house, and the deposit was paid. The house payment was ready. It was just a matter of signing the contract when the seller refused to sell. Mr. Lu was frustrated and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yiwu Municipal People's Court.
After trial, the court concluded that the two sides ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, which cannot be solely attributed to the defendant. It should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed, so this case should not be applied to the deposit penalty. The defendant should not bear the default responsibility for double returning the deposit.
After the first verdict, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the second appellate court upheld the original verdict.
Lawyers remind that in the course of the transaction, it is necessary to perform the necessary cautionary duty.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, you should fulfill the necessary prudent attention obligations, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the house is occupied, and other relevant information in the contract, and clarify the specific time and place of delivery in case of disputes during the implementation of the contract.
China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson issued a statement on Saturday (December 11) after the "Democratic Summit" ended, saying that the United States held the "leading people’s summit" in order to "divide people on the basis of ideology, to weaponize democracy and to promote confrontation and division within China."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value ideology on others, promoted "democratic transformation", used unilateral sanctions, and instigated "color revolution", causing disastrous consequences.
Democracy has long been a "major weapon of mass destruction" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
This summit is Biden's action to fulfill his election promise.
The two-day meeting was held in video form, with the participation of leaders from 111 countries, including Taiwan's leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the US for its own democracy, saying that the US was not qualified to chair such a summit.
There are also voices of questioning internationally and in the United States. For example, some leaders with authoritarian tendencies have criticized the invitation and attendance, such as the leaders in some countries with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders in the Philippines, Poland and Brazil. Some people doubt that the true intentions of the Biden administration are not to organize this summit for geopolitical purposes but for democracy.
The newly appointed German Prime Minister Schroeder also participated in the video democracy summit
In a statement on Saturday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said, "The American democracy is in a state of madness today. The problems of money politics, identity politics, political party rivalry, political polarization, social division, racial contradictions, and the division of the rich and the poor are becoming more and more serious." The American democracy is based on the foundation of capital, "rich people's game."
In his speech, US President Joe Biden said, "As the leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reforms, and achieve transparent accountability governance, which can better resist the buffer and impact of the power of the authoritarianism and those who want to pursue power in front of the public interest. "
He emphasized that democracy is not automatic, “We must constantly update it in each generation, and in my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our era.”
Biden also said that democracy and human rights "face persistent and worrying challenges, and democracy needs fighters to defend it".
The US promised to launch an action plan of one year after the democratic summit, including an initiative worth $4.244 billion to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that all countries will make concrete commitments before the planned实体 democracy summit in 2022 to improve their democratic systems.
Biden said, "Let us all implement our commitments and report our progress next year."
Okay, I only fear that he sends the wrong address.

What is the drinking method of red liquor?
Each person's hobby is different. Some people like collecting, some people like eating, and of course, some people like drinking. Red Label Whiskey is one of the most popular Scottish whiskies in all countries. And Red Label Whiskey has won the gold medal at the International Wine and Spirits Competition.
Each bottle of red label whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, it would be a waste of its rich aroma.
How to drink red liquor?
Here is a brief introduction for you.
Red Wine Drinking:
Guinness Red Label Whiskey is made from about 35 types of Scotch Whiskey, with a rich aroma and characteristics of traditional Scotch Whiskey. The aroma is rich, sweet and smoky.
The entrance is rich and fresh, with a slight aroma of vanilla and strong smoke.
The wine can be drunk directly with ice, or mixed with the favorite beverage.
Red Label Whiskey enters the domestic market, in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, Red Label Whiskey + Coca-Cola or Soda or Xicure or other bubble drinks have become a lasting fashion.
These sweet drinks can not only neutralize the acidity, but also bring pleasure to the eyes, and add drinks to dilute the alcohol taste and change the taste.
Red whisky + sliced lemon + sugar (sugar can also be used), is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The authentic red wine taste is a little sour, and the addition of sugar can neutralize the sour taste, while the lemon will bring the wine a fresh aroma. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to the personal taste.
These three are the best ways to drink red whiskey. You can try it as a reference and hope that my introduction can help you.
Education thought: How college entrance examination makes the "top students" and "poor students" get their own place - Xinhua
Three students from兰州交通大学 wrote to the school leaders to express their confusion about the college entrance examination and put forward their demands to improve the difficulty of the examination and change the examination formats so that the examination truly reflects the actual level of students.
In fact, for a long time, college entrance examination has been a "hot topic".
In the university campus, students come from all over the country, with different levels of ability and different levels of learning. In addition, the learning situation is different.
For a group with such diversified characteristics, it is inevitable to have different feelings.
Of course, if the test questions have a simple format and a high repetition rate, the questions will inevitably cause a completely different feeling.
Unsuccessful students may pass the examination by focusing on the examination before the examination, and if there is another way, it may achieve a better effect.
As a result, there is a “bad student” who can pass the examination even if he does not put in much effort; and a “good student” who never misses a class, does a good job in his homework and notes, and does not have a “bad situation” in the examination.
Thus, it seems that the problems reflected in the university examination are not without cause. It is believed that this situation exists not only in兰州交通大学.
From this point of view, it is praiseworthy that these three students wrote directly.
In fact, people who have gone to university are aware that the phenomenon of over-preparing for the examination, thinking of various ways to "borrow" the examination questions from the teachers, so as to get "pointed tutoring" before the examination is not uncommon. In fact, people who have gone to university are aware of the phenomenon that over-preparing for the examination, thinking about various ways to "borrow" the examination from the teachers, so as to get "personalized tutoring" before the examination is not uncommon.
In my opinion, as a quality assessment-oriented teaching, it is more about the comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning by teachers and the scientific命题 on this basis.
When entering the college level, the majors begin to be specialized, and many majors are based on basic knowledge.
It is undeniable that whether to master the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content of the college entrance examination.
The basic knowledge of undergraduate courses is basically the basic theory and basic knowledge of disciplines. From the point of view of knowledge, there is not much change, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "20 years ago, I learned basic knowledge of university mathematics, and I still learn it today. It is still the focus."
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test question types and test questions are repeated.
In many universities, exams are usually organized into question groups, and then organized into test papers by subject experts. The exam scoring is also done by all teachers in charge of the subject, so that the situation of repeated questions can be somewhat overcome.
However, to come up with a set of questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning situation, the questions should be difficult and easy in a normal distribution, and we should comprehensively master the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the questions can have dynamic grasp of difficulty and question types, so that we can highlight the examination of basic knowledge, but also take into account the examination of ability, and at the same time, innovative design of question types.
The examination is the key to university education. What kind of examination students have, they will have corresponding preparation plans. This will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the student's suggestion letter, the兰州交通大学校方 attached great importance to it and has already deployed the rectification plan in the whole university.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out discussions and course completion examinations to compare self-correction, formulate examination papers and related systems, and at the same time, strengthen the supervision and inspection of the examination papers and review process, clarify the grading system, and strengthen the comprehensive evaluation of all aspects of the course teaching.
From a mechanistic point of view, solving the problems of single question types and repeated questions is a topic that college entrance examinations need to face. Of course, it needs to come up with corresponding systems, but the key is in daily practice. Teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to master the teaching content, but also to grasp the student's learning situation. Both ends should be grasped, and the teaching and learning will be better docked, forming a positive interaction, and the examination will also be more realistic, so that the "top students" and "poor students" can get their own space.

Golden Flower Bridal Photography (South Street Store) has not yet opened a branch
Before taking the photo, because we didn't arrange our time well, we had to change the time twice. The consultant, Lan Lan, was very patient to help us arrange the time.
He chose a good weather weekend to shoot.
The staff of the Golden Lady is superb, whether it is the consultants, makeup artists or photographers.
This is my first time to make up. Wow, I can't believe that I will become so beautiful one day.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry, I can't remember the name) are very patient in makeup. They also make makeup very naturally.
The scene was filmed in Jiang Bay City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, so I did not feel very cold. When I took photos, the makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes, headpieces, and help us arrange if there was something wrong.
The photographer is also very humorous. He feels very happy after taking photos for a whole day.
When choosing the photos, because I saw a lot of cases online, I didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we chose the photos, in fact, they didn't mean to add photos. Only 24 photos in the package were added (it was said that my cousin who took a wedding photos at the same time as me took 7,000+ photos, and I was shocked at that time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many photos)
Today, the photo was fixed, and Lan Lan sent it to me. I saw two photos that I thought were not good. They immediately helped me redo it.
Comparing the photos of her sister before, I think our photos are really satisfied. Simple and fresh, that's what I wanted.
I sincerely recommend you to take a wedding photo in Panheng Golden Lady!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Kim is grateful for your sincere wishes for her happiness and success.

Sabah's 3,200 new babies have no birth paper due to shortage of specially-designed anti-counterfeit paper
(Yabuli, 11 September) The National Registration Bureau of Sabah said that due to the depletion of specially-designed anti-forgery paper, it has been unable to issue baby paper since the beginning of October, and so far, more than 3,200 people have been affected.
However, the director of the Bureau, Kailamunius, assured that all the babies who have applied for the newspaper paper have been recorded in the system, and that the fake paper will be issued as soon as it arrives next week.
In the press conference, he explained the 10-month long report on the printing problem of Sarawak newspaper by a website media.
He said that the problem had appeared two months ago, and Sulu was also facing the same problem.
One reason is that the Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeit paper have been affected by the epidemic, which has delayed the delivery to China.
He explained that the anti-piracy paper used in Sabah newspaper paper is different from other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states.
The latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on June 6 and was handed over to the printing company on August 8 for partial printing.
The agency will send a team to pick up the goods in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday and return to Sabah immediately for the final printing, which is estimated to take two working days (December 20).
We will notify the applicants to go to the regional branches to collect the newspaper paper. "
He added that Sarawak has issued a total of 2,48,101 birth certificates so far this year.

48 hours of negative nucleic acid and set up a "buffer zone" The State Council has issued a call for strengthening the prevention and control of epidemic outbreaks at ports and cities - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Qiu Tiancheng) The State Council has recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in ports and cities, requiring people who have left the port cities on land (excluding Hong Kong and Macao) within the past 48 hours to have a negative result of the nucleic acid test within 48 hours, and that people who have arrived at the port cities on land should have at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the determination of the port city range and the announcement by the provinces and cities to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notification also proposed that border cities with conditions can study the establishment of a pandemic prevention buffer zone within their jurisdiction.
According to the person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health and Family Planning Commission, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic support for the local economy. The two sides have frequent exchanges of migrant workers.
By implementing the differentiated management policy of dividing the region into two lines, it is expected to realize the shift of the frontier and reduce the risk of outbreaks. With the smallest social impact and lowest social cost, it is expected to achieve the greatest effectiveness of epidemic prevention.
Recently, there have been a number of local cluster outbreaks in China, all of which were imported from abroad through port cities.
The above notice points out that these issues have exposed some problems in the timely monitoring and early warning of local epidemics, the inadequate implementation of closed-loop management for personnel at high-risk jobs, the formalization of regular nucleic acid tests, the inadequate control of cold chain items at all links, the inadequate management of centralized isolation facilities, and the inadequate scientific and precise emergency response to epidemics.
The notice requires that we focus on nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the shortfall of epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and to do a good job of epidemic prevention and control without relaxing and scientifically and accurately. We should weave a tight line of external prevention and control.
The notice emphasizes that the port cities should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and people's livelihood security at the same time, publish and open up the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check the supply and price of basic living materials, and solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems that the masses report.
According to the notice, the cities mentioned in the notification include the counties (municipalities, districts, and flags) of open land, water, and air ports, the cities (municipalities, districts, and states) and the cities (municipalities, districts, and provinces) where the open land, water, and air ports are located, and the specific scope is determined by the provinces (provinces, autonomous regions, and prefectures) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and timely announced.

The truth behind the bloodshed of the US army for 20 years - Xinhua
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Machine of Death" caused a lot of attention.
The film tells the story of the United States using the pretext of "anti-terrorism" to launch the war in Afghanistan, forcibly exporting American democracy through the war, and 20 years of militarism, bloodthirstiness and massacre of innocents, committing various crimes against humanity.
Using drones to bomb hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distorting human nature and forming a killing group.
In the past 20 years, the US has killed thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan.
The US military set up a "black prison" to inflict various tortures and humiliate the "defendant".
More and more Afghans are infuriated by human rights violations.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorist" war is "anti-terrorist".
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan, but only devastation and destruction.
Watch the video, let's expose the truth behind the US' so-called "anti-terrorism" and bloodshed, and expose the false face of American democracy!
I accidentally saw the following article, from the business point of view and the perspective of the shelf life, why this customer should keep the logistics company in the tax-free zone. Although the sealing is deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of the tax-free logistics company, this article may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and met many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the canned and bottle milk are the same. There is no difference.
So everyone will definitely ask: Why is the bagged shelf life one year, while the bottle shelf life is two years or more?
Or ask again: Why is the price difference between the album and the bag so large?
In fact, many consumers or mothers believe that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the more expensive is the better.
There are also consumers who have eaten and said that the taste or smell is different!
Now I will talk to you about the reasons for the high price of soft drinks. Where is the high price?
Why are the prices so different?
Because most manufacturers take into account the fact that if the bagged price is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the manufacturer's profit is low or there is no profit. What does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
Therefore, in terms of the pricing of tinctures, there has been a significant increase to ensure their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers focus on listening, rather than bags.
There are so many manufacturers who think so much, and their annual advertising costs are hundreds of millions or even billions. Where is the money coming from?
Everyone knows.
Therefore, with the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, such as the promotional expenses of shopping malls, the display expenses of shopping malls, the gift expenses of products, and advertising expenses, are also increasing.
Therefore, all manufacturers are also increasing their new products, and they are also in the form of bottles, and their prices are also increasing. In fact, this is the new products that have been released in response to the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, their raw materials will not cost more than 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands that do not hesitate to use doctors in hospitals to promote their products, taking 30 yuan to 80 yuan from each bottle.
The relevant laws of China are absolutely not allowed to do such a way of operation. In fact, this is a way of deceiving consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bagged milk and put it in a jar, which can save costs and increase the shelf life and sealing of the milk. There is no effect on children.
And don't think that the shelf life of the canned food is longer than that of the bag. If the shelf life of the canned food is the same as that of the bag after opening the bag, it is more difficult to store the bag than the canned food.
The food was cold and hard to eat after being delivered late.

Don't scare people at the start of the race - Xinhua
When you go to the book fair, you often feel the hotness of success books.
Nowadays, many success books promote the best principles - that is, to assume or imply that you can "achieve", and then tell you what you need to "achieve".
In other words, it has bypassed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
For this reason, these books have a common characteristic: Either do everything to the best of your ability, or don't do anything at all; Either 100, or 0; Either climb Mt.
This "best principle" will make everyone recognize "right and perfect", but 99% of people will be scared at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a "it is necessary to make a 180-degree big change and make a decision to change your life" path, which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who adhere to tradition, conform to the past and refuse change, you have to shout at his ear that you need to change, which is self-serving and a waste of time.
Most people will be cowardly in front of the two words "transformation" and hesitate to make a decision. Or they will make a decision based on impulsive feelings and take the first step, but often it will not last long. It is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sili's famous "From tomorrow" sketch is the most vivid expression of this "common humanity" classic.
The biggest problem of the "最好原则" is that the threshold is too high, which often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, making most people "hopeless".
Perhaps, the "lesser principle" is a way for more ordinary people to take a relatively successful path.
The core of the "less is more principle" is "downsizing the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "winning by small successes", that is, if you can't do 100, you can do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, you can climb the little sand dunes at home, too, because that is always better than stagnant.
In summary, as long as you do something, it is always better than not doing anything.
Because the threshold has been greatly reduced, there is more possibility for ordinary people to persist, and everything that persists will increase the success probability.
The road to success following the "less is more" principle is a little longer.
In summary, the "Best Practices", despite its outward appearance of success for everyone, can actually motivate a small number of people; while the "Second-Best Practices" can effectively motivate more people and make as many people benefit as possible.

The amount of raw fish resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporter: Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxian) The reporter learned from the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results showed that the amount of raw fish resources in the Shaanxi Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons. Compared with the initial protection in 2002, the cumulative growth has been more than 40 times.
The naked carp of Qinghai Lake is commonly known as "Tushe Fish", which is a rare fish species in Qinghai Lake and plays an important role in maintaining the security and biodiversity of the "water - fish - bird" ecological chain in Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as the large-scale killing of fish and the deterioration of the environment for the reproduction of naked carp, the number of naked carp in the Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the resource potential of the Qinghai Lake naked carp was only 2592 tons.
In the "Red List of Endangered Species in China" in 2004, Qinghai Lake Naked鲤 was listed as an endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of the lake and the breeding of fish, and has banned any unit, collective or individual from the Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake from fishing for naked carp, and has banned the sale of naked carp and their products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial insemination and cleaning the main river channels of the Qinghai Lake, as well as the design of scientific and reasonable "overfish passage", the protection strength continues to be increased. The amount of Qinghai Lake Naked鲤 resources is increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, the deputy director of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, the naked carp in the Shaanxi Lake have been accumulated to implement the artificial reproduction and release of nearly 180 million fish, and the contribution rate of the recovery of the Shaanxi Lake naked carp resources has exceeded 23%.
The三江源 region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source for China and even Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area to control the eastward spread of desertification in western China.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake and the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has issued fishing bans in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, and has built a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river and one lake".

The restaurant only gave me a bag, and I had to put it in a bag. It was cold.
I want to ask, is the delivery in a bag?

I want to know whether it was lost or whether someone took it. Thank you.
It has been 1 hour, but it hasn't been delivered yet.
I just saw a long article on menstruation.
科普 to unknown men.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period at the age of 13 to 15, and then stop menstruating at the age of 50.
After his health is good, he will come regularly every month.
But it is not a rule that can be precisely predicted. About a week of deviation needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes bad luck will also cause the car to crash (suddenly ahead of days).
The length of time, blood volume, and the degree of menstrual cramps vary from person to person. Some people have it for three days, some for one week; some have less bleeding, and some have major hemorrhage; some people have no reaction, and some are so painful that they have to be taken to the ambulance. The degree of menstrual cramps will change with time. It used to be that it would not hurt, but it does not mean that it will not hurt in the long run.
The flow of menstrual blood cannot be controlled, and it can last for a few days from the beginning to the end. What can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to suck up the blood to prevent it from spilling on the clothes and chairs.
The main reason for menstrual cramps is the release of prostaglandins. If you take Ibuprofen when the cramps begin, it can effectively alleviate the pain in the month. But if you take it after the cramps begin, it won't help.
Because the uterus is swollen and the release of prostaglandins is excessive before the period, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If the cycle is about to come, suddenly have diarrhea, and basically have a period within two days.
The sanitary pad should be changed for two or three hours every time, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. If the sleep time is taken out, the worst case is to change 6 times a day, 7 days a month, 42 pieces, which is not one piece every month.
(Here, sanitary pads do not need to be changed often, about 5-6 hours per time, and the longest is 8 hours)
The mood during the menstrual period may be more irritable, and the mood during the ovulation period may also be unstable due to changes in internal hormones, which is very unfortunate. The body is playing tricks on you.
However, the official crime rate data show that the ability of women to control emotions is still high, and they will not find excuses for emotional problems.
The flow is not only blood, but also shed uterine lining.
After the end of menstruation, the uterine lining is the thinnest, and then gradually thickens. It is understandable that the uterus is a house, building a house every month (the uterine lining thickens) to prepare for guests, but if guests do not come, all the houses are dismantled (the menstrual blood is discharged). The next month, the house is rebuilt again and again.
The menstrual period is inconvenient. For decades, there are days of 24-hour bleeding and abdominal pain. Who wants that?
But it is thanks to his mother that he was born. Menstruation is to prepare a house for him to live in for 10 months when he comes into the world. We should thank our mother for having regular and healthy menstruation.
Previously, many things about women were suppressed. The society taught women that they were dirty, shameful, and everyone thought that was the truth, but things have changed.
If someone thinks that menstruation is disgusting and that the body of a woman is prepared for the birth of life, they should not say it in public, and the girls should stand up and stop thinking that they have never experienced it, and they will never experience it, and they are not very familiar with men. Do not be so ungrateful, do not know how to behave. How dare you face your mother and how dare you want your child?
Finally, sisters try sanitary pads, they really work.
Today is the winter solstice festival. It is disappointing to send it wrong.
We will have another meal for the children.
It is hoped that the store will check the output during its busy time
Do you feel numb when you take a bath in a foot bath?
Choosing a suitable foot bath can have a good effect on foot therapy and health. Today, the State of the Art editor will answer this question, which may help friends.
As people's awareness of health has increased, foot baths have become more and more popular, and a number of different products with different prices have appeared on the market. From more than 100 yuan to more than 1,000 yuan, the foot baths are dazzling, giving consumers a great choice space.
On the relevant data surface, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of footbaths and other health-related household appliances are hot, but footbaths have no special industry standards, so there is a certain safety risk.
It is really dangerous to soak your feet in a charged water!"
Mr. Li told the reporter that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt numb when he washed his feet.
Mr Li initially thought that it was due to the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numb at the bottom of his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen and found that it was charged. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was charged.
He then contacted the merchants, and the merchants were not bad. Although he withdrew the footbath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that this well-established foot bath has no clear and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the highest temperature, which population is suitable for it, and what materials ensure it is harmless.
However, in general, a foot bath is not likely to have a problem with electricity. However, it is not excluded that a small number of products were not strictly checked at the time of production.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a separate foot bath.
Water and electricity are separated, and there is no safety risk.
At the same time, you can measure it with a pencil.
Opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Fair - Viewpoint Top News - Hunan Daily Net - Hua Xiang Online
Yueyang Daily (Full Media Reporter Zhang尚武, Hu Wanting, Correspondent Liu Xiaolong, Photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Yueyang Tea Industry Expo and the introduction of Nanyang Red Tea were held at the Yueyang International Convention and Exhibition Center. The exhibition showcased the tea industry, innovative tea technology, promoted tea culture, and accelerated the goal of a hundred billion yuan of the tea industry.
Hui Juxing, deputy director of the Council of the China National Retailing Cooperative Society, and Ye Hongzhong, deputy director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony.
Prof. Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand introduction at the opening ceremony: The source of the red lake is in Xing'an, and the rise of red tea as a "five-colored Xiang Tea" has injected new impetus.
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of a billion-yuan Hunan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "Sichuan, four waters and five colors of tea."
In the province, the tea industry has increased its innovation, and green tea, black tea, and red tea have all worked hard. The main tea production areas have promoted the integration of travel and tea, and have led to an increase in income for the vast number of tea farmers.
风水轮流转, red tea is back.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after harvesting green tea, harvesting red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income throughout the year, and the output value of the tea garden has risen steeply.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders honored the fourth batch of companies authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xiyang Chaptured the "Hunan Red Tea Origin".
In the exhibition hall of the new-yi red tea, Fujian tea merchants saw a high mountain tea called "ice in spring" and immediately ordered it.
Wang Zheng, secretary general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said that the current epidemic and other factors have a certain impact on the tea market, but from the perspective of the tea exhibition, there are many highlights.
Xing'an red tea, with a red color, has injected the connotation of tea culture, and has a high人气, high transaction and new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be canceled?
I don't want it. Due to the fact that he couldn't stop, he couldn't deliver it
Philosophy refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception.
Philosophy is the basic rule of metaphysics, which aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the term "metaphysics" comes from the phrase "metaphysics" in the Book of Translations of the Book of Changes, "metaphysics is called the way, and the way is called the instrument", which was translated by Japanese井上哲次郎 (in the Meiji era) from metaphysics.
Philosophical branches include ontology, natural theology, and its related problems.
The essence of ontology is "to study what terms represent real existential entities and what terms only represent a concept".
Philosophical naturalism, which denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis believes that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, and it is proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
The naturalistic method refers to the method of studying God without saying a word.
The spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and their relationship with the body (especially the brain).
Two-party thinking on the relationship between the soul and the body is the most important.
Knowledge theory is a philosophical branch that explores the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the systematic thinking and research of human moral life; here, ethics is defined as all the behavioral norms recognized by a group or a culture.
It is mainly divided into primary ethics (abstractly studying ethical theories or critically analyzing the essence), and normative ethics (judging various different moral views and giving moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral behavior norms people should follow, ethical application (the academic application of ethical theories to actual life situations, including biological ethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (the gathering of information on how people live, based on observed styles).
It does not start from the expected theoretical basis, but investigates the actual moral subjects (moral agents) who make real choices and are observed, and all the moral factors that promote this decision. It studies the ethical outlook of social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.
Part 1: Humanist ethics, with Valery and Montaigne as representatives.
Part 2: The ethical thought of religious reform, with Calvin as a representative.
Part III: Political Ethics, with Machiavelli and others as representatives, Modern Ethics (17-18th century, British Empiricism Ethics, represented by Hume and others, 17-18th century, European Rationalism Ethics, represented by Spinoza and others, 18th century, French Enlightenment Ethics, represented by Voltaire and others, 18th-19th century, German Academy Ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel and others, 18th-19th century, British Utility Ethics, represented by Bentham and Sidgwick and others, late 19th century, evolutionary ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley and others, late 19th century, new Kantian Ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche.
Logic is a subject that studies the principles and standards of effective deduction and proof.
Logic usually includes three parts:归纳 reasoning, cause reasoning and deductive reasoning, and can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
The aesthetics is a subject centered on the study of the essence of beauty and its significance.

丁子霖: To a friend.
I sincerely thank all friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years after my family members were killed. In particular, since I issued a call for humanitarian assistance to friends overseas and domestically at the beginning of 1994, I have never stopped the assistance.
Nowadays, most of the dead parents are dead, and the orphans are also grown up and have jobs.
It is your righteous deed that has helped us through the most difficult time.
At present, the COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping the world, and most donors have reached the age of retirement.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to suspend the humanitarian donations to the Mother Group in Tiananmen Square, which should have ended perfectly long ago.
I will always remember your love and believe that your deed will be remembered by history.
Because of various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way. Please forgive me!
Accept my sincere blessings.
Taobao: Let me take this opportunity to introduce the history of the United States National Federation of Chinese Students (IFCSS) and the Minessota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in humanitarian aid for 32 years.
In the process of humanitarian aid, the United States Association of University Students and the Minessota Chinese Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations. The project executors often have crossovers.

The rescue funds often cannot be delivered to the families of the 6th June.
In 1994, under the suggestion of Ding Jie, a special group was set up by the "Mother of Tiananmen" to coordinate and distribute the humanitarian aid.
In 1998, the MCDF set up the "六四 orphan education fund", and after 11 years, in 2009, all the orphans of the Tiananmen Massacre graduated from universities, the MCDF then set up the "六四 old people in need of special assistance fund", and has been implemented to this day.
The funds for these projects come mainly from campus and social donations in June 1984, from individual donations, and are supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Prison Reform Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the members of the六四 generation finally received a donation from Hong Kong that was raised in the name of the六四.
During this period, China Human Rights also independently implemented its humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding called a halt to the donation for the六四, thinking about the donors. We are all retired old people, and our income is not as plentiful as before. We sincerely appreciate Mr. Ding's letter to his friends.
We will respect the decision of the relatives, terminate this project within two years, and resume when necessary.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those brave colleagues who have been generous in giving and risking to deliver humanitarian aid for many years.

Package price: 1000 yuan
Thank you for the review from the rabbit. I originally said that it was not suitable for the traditional style. I did not expect the final product to be so beautiful.
Thanks for Dandan's recognition, your satisfaction will make us full of energy to continue forward, and we will continue to push forward!
This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend all my friends to come!
Whether it is in terms of reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography and post-production, it is flawless.
The makeup artist is particularly meticulous, and can match your style to suit your makeup. The cosmetics used are all high-end brands.
Mr. Tian Liang, for example, is a professional photographer.
The whole studio is full of artistic atmosphere, and there are two little cats to play with.
We work in Beijing, and Beijing's better photo studios need to wait for six months in advance. Our colleagues have taken photos in Beijing, and I have seen the finished product, which is just so-so.
I specifically searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and we think this is also the short version of most people. The photographer, Liang哥, will seize the moment and record the natural beauty.
Make-up artist, photographer, post-production, a fine team.
We and everyone around us were amazed.
She has recommended her friend to go, and her friend just saw the finished film and was equally happy.
It is hoped that such a studio will not be buried, and more people will discover it and make it their own style, rather than copying others.
I would like to express my gratitude to the five-star comments from Guo Yan and Jing玲. Both of them are very creative new people with great ideas. We are the creative studio. We will do our best to complete the project if the customer likes it. Thank you for meeting each other.
The sweet assistant and the lively photographer teacher, every member of the team is super nice. A wonderful shooting experience, a wonderful experience, and the shooting effect is much better than I expected. Everyone has worked hard, thank you.
Thank you for Xiaoyu's commentary. Meeting you is also a blessing. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao. Our trust in you is thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to meet you. I hope to come to Qinhuangdao again next time.

Now the restaurant staff calls me
An aspiring programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't have such ideas, it is better to learn by yourself, because training costs are very high and it takes 6 months to learn.
However, if you plan to enter the industry, training is indeed a very good choice. Especially for those with weak self-discipline, training is a very good choice.
If you have a strong self-discipline, you can also choose to learn by yourself. However, it will be more tiring.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, we should see the strength of the teachers. If the teachers are not strong enough, this training institution will not have any meaning. Of course, some new training institutions have not strong teachers.
In addition, before choosing the training institution, it is better to inquire about it. It is better to inquire about the students who graduated from the institution. Only the students can know the institution in detail.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because for your own situation, I haven't made a certain introduction, and the relationship between learning this thing and your own situation is very big.
For example, professional, age, the language you want to learn, and even where you want to study, all have a relationship with the industry you want to study or work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated or if you are a computer professional who has graduated, I recommend that you study on your own. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Many online and offline training institutions are actually very good. However, the cost of learning is high, and the time invested is more. You need to focus on training for 3 to 6 months.
However, if these situations are what I said, self-study is very convenient, and many learning resources online are free or there are many training resources on Baidu. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources or detailed consultations.
In addition, there are some other classic books that can be combined with videos to learn.
If you are not a computer major, but can afford to pay for a certain amount of learning costs and time costs, you should go to a training institution to learn. This will not be hard to learn, the teacher will explain it in detail, and there will also be someone to answer questions. In addition, it will also help in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internship places, and recommend them to companies after learning. This will also save a lot of time for the next job interview.
These are some of my views. I only introduced them briefly because I didn't know your situation. If you have any other questions, you can contact me at any time.
I said come 1 o'clock, I saw it in the App.
What is
I haven't finished, what are you doing?
I, personally, take on all kinds of (installation, cleaning, repair) of heating boilers, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, oil burners, light fittings, glass cleaning, professional sealing, home care services.
Thank you to those who have given me a thumbs up for my hard work in life. Life is tiring, but we must continue.
Life will not辜负 every effort. If you like, please pay attention to me. Thank you those who have given me a thumbs up.
Life is like this. The others only see the result, while we support the process. In the face of life, we can only be strong and continue. We have no choice but to continue. We can look back, but we cannot go back.
Cleaning is a job, but also a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of care.
Although we clean the most dirty job, we will do it with the most serious attitude. We will clean every corner of the customer's home. When we see the customer's satisfied smile and big thumb, all the fatigue is worth it. We will have a reward.
My daily work
Your request, my service.
Serve with care, clean with care, and leave a good impression.
You are concerned about the details, Feng Gui Home Care will help you achieve "clean" what I can, service love home.
Keep the home clean, set up a home care record, and do a good job.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp is beautiful, if it is not cleaned for a long time, it will be dull. Only after it is cleaned can it shine. Life is the same.
To succeed, you have to put in some effort, and to create a beautiful space, we are serious.
Give me a chance, I will make you satisfied, quality is everything, because professional is worthy of trust, your recognition is my encouragement!
The current industry is not good!
But I always believe that I will be better than others, at least I will be better than sitting and complaining!"
The key to a successful day lies in the morning. All the good begins in the morning. I hope you start your new day with happiness, luck, health, and prosperity. Good morning!
When I was young, happiness was something, and having it was happiness; When I was old, happiness was a goal, and achieving it was happiness; When I grew up, I realized that happiness was a mindset, and I was happy.
Do the most real and kindest self, act according to the heart, no regrets in this life; there is only one road in life, follow your own path; there are two treasures in life: good health and good mood, live a beautiful life!
Every stage of life will encounter different difficulties.
Many times, what binds you is not ability, but the courage to face positively.
Since we can't avoid it, let's face it.
If you are afraid, you will be defeated by difficulties; if you face difficulties, the problem will be solved.
China and Saudi Arabia jointly hold the first contemporary art exhibition in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporters Wang Hsiui and Hu Guo) -- Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial, the Darya Contemporary Art Biennial, officially opened to the public on November 11 in the Darya Art District in the northern part of the Saudi capital, Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and other places participated in the biennial.
This biennial is jointly planned by the Saudi Driyay Biennial Foundation and the UCCA in China, and the curator of the UCCA in China, Tian Yuyi, is the artistic director.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of this biennial is "crossing the river by touching the stone", which is an allusion to the reform strategy adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi social and cultural development.
The two-year exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and is displayed in six interconnected buildings. It is displayed in six units: "Touching the Rocks to Cross the River", "Transmission as an Experiment", "Edge Thought", "Going to the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "The Spirit of Art".
Among them, the number of works by 27 Saudi artists accounts for more than 40% of the total number of works in the exhibition, covering painting, installation art and performance art; the works of 12 Chinese artists are also very popular, and some artists use recycled materials in a novel way to create works, such as Xu Bing in the "Series of stories behind the picture" (2014).
Barki, the chief executive of the Dubai Biennial Foundation, said that he hopes that this biennial will establish international dialogue, allowing global audiences to learn about Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction.
田霏宇 said, "The purpose of the biennial is double. It not only allows Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, but also allows Saudi audiences to integrate into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of seminars will also be held during the opening week of the two-year festival. Artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss issues such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare jobs - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job of employment assistance for those who have been lifted out of poverty, and consolidate and expand the results of the poverty alleviation campaign, Yunnan Province has recently issued relevant policies to promote the management of public welfare posts in rural areas, helping to comprehensively promote the revitalization of rural areas.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 44,83,000 rural public service posts, which are used for the employment of rural vulnerable groups such as those with poverty, and plays an important role in helping those with poverty to achieve employment and income increase, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the public services in rural areas.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources, Rural Revitalization, Finance and other seven departments. The main purpose of the new regulations is to unify and standardize the scope of applicants for rural public service posts, the management of funds, the development of posts, and the management of posts.
In terms of job development setting, the new regulations clarify that job development should be set according to the principle of "job needs setting, person-based, dynamic management, total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person, one job, voluntary publicity, unified management".
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, declaration, inspection, publicity, employment, pre-employment training and appointment.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare posts, and stipulate that the development departments of rural public welfare posts should buy accident damage commercial insurance for the安置 personnel; and require relevant departments to regularly monitor the subsidy of rural public welfare posts.
Address is wrong
Hello
Can you cancel the order?
I order again
Is it cancelled?
Second, although the right wing has a successful era in history, it is not long, so the short time is because the sun shines when you give it a little, and sweat when you drink some water; when you get a little success, you will feel elated, and when you are hit, you will feel helpless.
But in fact, the right-wing played a positive role in social progress.
From the end of the definition of truth standards, the development of economy, the improvement of technology and the promotion of institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right wing should not be denied.
As for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Wei Dong's opinions, I care about his opinions, and I also respect Li Wei Dong, because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is serious about social issues in China.
However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that the anti-revolution is inevitable, and the revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil,民生 damage, and political groups are mixed with mud and sand. In addition, foreign countries will take advantage of it.
Fourth, change or improve China needs patience and the attitude of responsible for the country and the people. The attempt of political speculation in the fire is not for the right, but for idiots.
Let's talk about it again.
Left, in fact, is a bunch of time and political orphans.
If the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing speeches and analyze their thoughts when it is needed, but the left will not have a chance, because the left is exactly what the Communist Party is throwing away!
Fifth, I recently saw some friends fighting against the enemy while refuting the left. It was quite moving. I think it is not necessary.
Do not try to reason with the traitor and the leftist, they are the same mind, there is no reason to talk.
We should not try to prove that we are right, and we should not think of letting the enemy and the left side recognize. Why?
I told my friends like this: When the fools call you five yuan, and when the leftists call you dog, it just proves that our middle road is right!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they are old, they forget their ideals, or pursue their ideals, but become obsessed.
And the ideal is getting farther and farther away, and even the dragon boy becomes a bad dragon.
To the left and to the right, I think generally refers to constraints and freedoms. China should be to the left according to its historical cultural innate genes.
While the right-wing liberals in China prioritize efficiency and development, the leftists strengthen regulation and focus more on fairness and security.
Nowadays, the general society wants to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, China and the United States are at war, and the left is certain. It is estimated that it will take many years.
Although I can't understand it, I just like it.
Nothing to say, flowers are so kind
In the past two years, the US blockade and blockade of Huawei chips has not only made Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses to "US-style" enterprises.
The United States has suppressed the chip industry in China, requiring its own enterprises and allied countries to block the chip industry in China at the same time, and the direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers have been affected, resulting in a decrease in the R&D investment of chip production enterprises and a decrease in production capacity, which has led to a shortage of the global chip supply chain.
Today, "missing chips" have affected every industry in the world, such as the shutdown of car companies and the rise of mobile phone prices. Almost all industries that use chips have suffered from it.
In order to grasp the autonomy of "chips", more and more countries' technology giants have begun the path of "going away".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control, and to restrain the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry, the United States has been making frequent moves recently. It is also the host of the "IC Summit". It is also inviting 64 countries to join the semiconductor alliance and provide financial support for American domestic technology giants. For example, the United States' oldest technology giant Intel has invested 2 billion dollars in two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, to reclaim the dominant position in the chip industry.
When most people think that Intel's move will cause a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to take over TSMC's "饭碗".
This is because Intel, as a well-established US technology giant, has spent decades in the semiconductor industry and has a large number of talented teams and technological reserves. It is certain to rise rapidly and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, for the decision of Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company founder Zhang Zhongming is indifferent.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongming surprised the audience with his words. For the move of Intel to build a wafer plant, Zhang Zhongming was quite frank: Intel builds a chip manufacturing plant, which is quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongming disliked Intel's entry into the semiconductor industry because he still had grievances with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of the US military industry, standing at the top of the world, and the leader in the world semiconductor industry.
In the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. The chip was designed, manufactured and tested by one factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a pattern makes some small enterprises unable to bear the burden, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are forced to walk away from the huge costs of production line construction.
Under the influence of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show the phenomenon of division and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongming heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he believed that since there was a company specializing in design, it was possible to set up a factory specifically for the manufacture of wafers.
Not long after, Zhang Zhongming's idea turned into reality, and TSMC was born.
TSMC focuses on "wafer processing" as its main business, without design, and only provides wafer manufacturing services.
At that time, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which was just established, was nothing more than a petty slave before Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongming once sought Intel Investment, but when Intel heard that Taiwan Semiconductor only did manufacturing in the chip industry, it was obvious that it was arrogant and disregarded Taiwan Semiconductor, so it refused to invest in Taiwan Semiconductor.
Zhang Zhongming also believed that Intel was despising the wafer process service at that time.
It was not expected that the giant who disliked the service of chip manufacturing was now going to start chip manufacturing.
Therefore, Zhang Zhong谋觉得英特尔进入晶圆代工很讽刺.
Today, the market value of TSMC has exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of the strong offensive of TSMC, Intel is also afraid to keep its step.
Today, TSMC has pushed ahead to the 3nm chip, while Intel is still stuck at 7 years ago's 14nm.
It is not easy to catch up.
Not waiting
The order was placed at 19:06.
Today, let's take a look at some strange hot search.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Rising, Goodluck Gone Up, and货拉拉 Incident, the public opinion spreads and forms a peak, then the "Index Decreases" (smooth curve) finally dissipates, and if there is secondary public opinion, a small hump will appear again.
They look the same as the "Internet Sentiment Evolution Model" displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Information Office.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot topics from the same event, and present them as "monument", "sawtooth" and "rocks".
The "mountain-like" is the human heating, and it quickly climbs the hot search, attracting the public's attention; the "sawtooth-like" is the periodic heating, and it ensures that the hot search is dominated by the topic; the "mountain-like" is the collective withdrawal, and when the hot search has fulfilled its function, it receives a new task and goes to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the event's heat wave coincides with the bottom of the other event's heat wave, and the time difference is not less than a second. It is certain that a unified batch of water forces received the task and opened a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black PR can be seen from the fact that dozens of hot topics are on the list at the same time. What attracts attention, what is responsible for popularization, what is responsible for raising the temperature, what is responsible for diverting attention, what affects cognition, what misleads judgment, what is responsible for stirring emotions, and what is responsible for influencing decisions? The account of the black market is divided into batches and nodes for detailed combat, almost considering all the elements of the dissemination of the public opinion.
Communication is a science, and without the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from the objective data, black PR will be nowhere to be found.
Every step will leave a trace. Such traces, we will dig up together.

Mauritius and other countries have found the first cases of Ominicorn poisoning infection - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 -- According to the report of the foreign reporters of Xinhua News Agency, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have reported the first case of infection with the variant virus of COVID-19 recently.
Mauritius reported the first two cases of OMMICYN poisoning in the country on October 10.
According to the Ministry of Health, one infected person was a tourist who left from South Africa on November 27 and arrived in Mauritius; another infected person was a Mauritian local resident who had contact with a person who had recently visited South Africa and returned on November 30.
After being quarantined in the hospital, the two infected persons' nucleic acid tests have turned negative. They have now returned to their residences.
Cyprus's Ministry of Health announced on October 10 that the country had confirmed the first three cases of the OMMYV strain.
These three people are students. They came back from overseas travel at the beginning of this month. Because they are all mild cases, they did not enter the hospital for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of the OMMIKOGON strain, the government has been increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter the country by air must pay for the nucleic acid test at the airport after arriving in Saudi Arabia.
On the 10th day of the month, the Ministry of Health announced that it will start to vaccinate children aged 5 to 11 in the country.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Kembo泽·奇蓬达, said on September 9 that the country had found three cases of OMMICRIN infection for the first time.

Do I need to stay in the dialogue?
I explained to your staff.
Your rider told me that the address is too far away
Big beauty 360 integrated home decoration
Address: No. 156, Guancheng Road, Fuxing Home, 12th floor
At first, it was recommended by a friend because of trust, so I decided to check it out. At first, my budget was 7,000 yuan for a basic renovation.
He came to the store and started a series of tricks.
I came to the store for the first time just to show them my floor plan, but they did not measure the house on the spot. They were able to give me a quote saying that my 135-square-meter house cost RMB7,000, and showed me their materials, but I did not know what brands they were.
Their second trick is that as soon as you come to the store, you will drag your feet and pay the deposit (and you will never get the money back unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I hesitate to pay the deposit, they will invite their so-called manager to tell you that you only have to pay the deposit to us and we can give you a discount.
This is a big hole, and I am an example of being deceived. When I was impulsive, I paid more than 10,000 yuan of deposit.
He gave me a lot of questions for the price of RMB 70,000, including the renovation of the electricity, including any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, and these three are the main costs of the basic installation.
In addition, their service fee is also higher than other companies.
I lost trust in this company. At first, I did not clarify anything and signed the contract.
When I went to ask for their money back, they showed their experience. They had special small teams to deal with you.
In any case, it is the problem of the customer. They are completely innocent.
All kinds of excuses, and a lot of details, I don't want to say one by one, it's all tears, in short, don't choose them, because my friend also hired them to renovate the house, and the quality was not good.
坑爹， they are the original龙头装饰, but now they have changed to big beauty, and they seem to have closed down again.
Therefore, don't choose such a cheesy contractor.
In the future, when you choose, you can do a little bit of research on these websites and consults, because decoration is not a small thing.
To ask a question, please log in or register first.
It is strictly forbidden to publish various forms of business comments, and detailed information can be found in the business listing statement.

This is so terrifying, please cancel the order within 30 minutes!
Isn't there another way? For example, changing the address?
Okay, then don't cancel this conversation. If I don't get my money back within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely hold you accountable.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes.

The Great Wall of China: The Sagittarius Perseids will arrive at their maximum on September 14 - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runqi) -- As the last major meteor shower in the Northern Hemisphere this year, the Sagittarius流星雨, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will usher in its maximum on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the following midnight.
The double starburst was photographed by Beijing Astronomical Amateur Anju in December 2018.
Most meteor showers have their parent bodies as comets, but the parent bodies of the Gemini meteor shower are 3,200 asteroids, which are Apollo-type asteroids.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not caused by a comet.
Xiao Liupeng, a member of the Astronomical Society of Tianjin and an expert in astronomy and popularization, said that, just like holiday movies, the Sagittarius流星雨 usually appears at the end of the year. "The screening period" can be from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is famous for its large flow and stable characteristics, and is known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
One of the prominent characteristics of the Sagittarius流星雨 is that the speed of the meteorite is slow, the color is rich, and the number of fireballs is not small. It is suitable for beginners to take photos both in sight and in astronomy.
Yang Jie, an amateur astronomer in Tianjin, took a photo of the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2020.
According to the meteorological prediction, the Sagittarius流星雨 will arrive at its maximum on December 14 around 15:00. At its maximum, the ZHR (the number of meteors per hour that can be seen under the ideal observation conditions where the radiation point is located at the top of the head) is 150.
The recommended index of the Sagittarius meteor shower.
Last year, the Gemini流星雨 left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini流星雨 will be affected by the moonlight, and the brilliance will be reduced a little.
On November 14, the lunar phase is a full moon, and the bright moon will cause interference in the observation. Fortunately, the bright moon will fall in the latter half of the night, and the radiation point of the Sagittarius流星雨 will rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the following hours after the moon sets. However, it is important to keep warm and dry. "
How can we observe more meteorites?
It is not recommended to observe in cities. You can choose a place with a high altitude, a low light pollution, a wide field of vision facing the north-east, and then wait patiently until the moon descends.
It is worth noting that the flow of the Gemini meteor shower is very large in all directions. When observing, it is not necessary to keep staring at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower.
For friends who like photography, it is best to choose a wide angle and a large aperture lens to take a breathtaking "large-scale meteor shower". When shooting, use a high ISO and a maximum aperture.
In view of stability and sustainability, tripod, spare batteries and shutter line are also indispensable. "
He reminded.
What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the topic should be the LCD TV, and the difference between the laser TV and the LCD TV in the market positioning mainly lies in the following two points:
First, the laser television is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the comprehensive market positioning of LCD televisions, laser televisions obviously focus on the big screen market, or the laser television itself is a product born for the big screen.
At present, mainstream LCD televisions are in the 55-inch to 65-inch range, while laser televisions are in the 75-inch and above range, with the largest exceeding 100 inches. They fully meet the needs of users for large-screen LCD televisions.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TV sales and sales in the world has been increasing, and in the overall television sales of more than 80 inches, it has accounted for more than 60%.
According to the prediction of China Everbright, the sales of laser TV will increase by more than 140% in 2020, and will continue to maintain high growth.
The reason for such a good performance in the large-screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent performance of laser televisions in terms of eye protection.
On the basis of the imaging principle of laser television, the light emitted by the laser light source does not enter the eye directly. Compared with the backlight of LCD television, the imaging process is closer to the natural condition of the object, and the stimulation on the eye is also smaller.
Through the strict comparison test of people watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions, a total of 144 sets of test data were obtained from the China Electronic Technology Standardization Institute and Beijing Hospital of Ophthalmology.
The data confirm that laser televisions have a strong eye-saving feature. In some aspects, they even have a certain improvement effect.
At a time when eye health is becoming more and more important, laser televisions not only attract more and more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also open up another breakthrough in the television market.
Second, laser televisions are more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuous descent of the price of LCD televisions, the price of laser televisions on the market is mostly more than 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price is gradually climbing.
Why is the price of laser TV so high?
It is certainly reasonable.
Under the continuous development of light sources and technical levels, laser televisions have many advantages that cannot be realized by LCD televisions and projectors.
With the ultra-short focus projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment. It can realize the experience of 100-inch screen at a short distance. It requires little space and the main body is small.
In terms of brightness, large brand-name laser televisions can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
In addition, it has a lower heating value, so it consumes less equipment and has a longer service life.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with many cutting-edge technologies, such as true 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system and bio-mimic screen, which can bring users a more shocking visual and sound experience.
It is not pseudo-demand, but the result of demand subdivision. In terms of picture quality and cost-benefit ratio, laser TV is not the dish of video players. If you want to balance the large screen and viewing environment, you can try it. There are both advantages and disadvantages, and you can judge after weighing. It is afraid of listening to one-sided words.
To put it simply, the ultra-wide-angle and close-up projector-laser television has to use the expensive ultra-wide-angle lens and reflector to fit closely to the screen, which is not in line with the optical best design.
In order to block part of the environmental light, use a micro-structure Phoney screen, which is expensive, and the price of 80 inches is basically able to exchange for a 65-inch LCD.
There is one more thing, I especially hate the projection manufacturers to use the "mirrorless" as a selling point. Please, the light on the screen for the eyes is the direct light, and the light reflected on the ceiling is not seen by the eyes. So, the LCD TV is also the "mirrorless". Isn't the ceiling also illuminated when you open the TV?
In addition, if the projection screen is not a mirror, it will not work.
It is just ignored the hot spot (spot) effect of the high-gain screen. A large amount of light is reflected to the eye from a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.

With the addition of a WeChat appointment date, the young lady sent me the available time schedule, and the reply was timely.
Before going, I saw the shooting works in the store. More were outdoors wedding dresses, which were beautiful and involved many styles of shooting.
After arriving on the same day, I had a brief exchange with the sister. She was very patient and helped me try two pairs of my troublesome style clothes. Finally, I decided to start makeup and styling. The photographer will set up some props before taking pictures. He will guide the movements and pay close attention to all the details.
But it may be because I didn't communicate with me about specific shooting ideas, so the style that was not what I wanted, but it should be good-looking <v>.</v>
After the photo is taken, the photographer will help choose the photos, exchange the style of post-production, and it feels very careful.
The restored film takes about half a month, waiting for the effect.
The second time I got a photo-themed霸王餐. Most of the clothes can be chosen to be photographed.
Finally, she chose a black silk skirt to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours. Make-up + shooting. The photographer responsible for the shooting is my younger brother, who is 95 years old. I feel a little bit fresh. I hope that I can give more suggestions for the customer's shooting motion guidance in the future. He is talkative. The shooting process is pleasant.

I got on the first page, and I also came to see Queenie.
Before coming to the store, I filled in my name and phone number, and then chose the clothes. The bridal gowns can be chosen. I changed three or four sets of clothes and was very patient. After choosing, I spent a long time on makeup. The service attitude was good. Later, I will teach you how to pose for the photo. It seems that my face is too big. The post-production said that it would take half a month or three or four days. It seems that there is no difference with the original film.
The environment is overall good.
There are many optional clothes.
There are three makeup positions in the room.
The service is very warm and very careful.
The hairstylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the action seriously.
If they are dissatisfied, the photographer will also propose to take the photo again.
The experience may have been a little too much. The original eyeliner was cut into three eyeliner.
The eyebrow was also shaved, which was a little awkward for people who don't usually shave their eyebrows.
The photo was sent to me ten days ago, but the photo editing effect is not satisfactory. I feel that the double eyelashes are still obvious.
Because it is not clear what style to choose, I tried two sets and finally chose the black dress. The little lady said that this is a kind of Hollywood retro style.
After choosing the right clothes, I started to make up. The hairstylist and makeup artist were very patient and helped me make up. The result was very satisfactory.
After getting ready, I started taking photos. The photographer had directed me to pose. The process was very easy and harmonious.
After shooting, he carefully selected four of his favorite and edited them. The result was very satisfactory.
I have not received any reply... Since your system cannot identify my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay
I have to pay for shipping every time
Can I be exempted first, and then be charged my monthly fee after you have investigated?
Will small umbrellas buy insurance?
Xiaoyi Umbrella is an Internet insurance broker platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on Insurance Brokers Supervision (Revised in 2015)," to become a insurance broker, one must meet three key words: shareholders and initiators must have no major violations in the past three years; the minimum limit is RMB 5 million; it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In fact, these three things are very strict. Summarized, they are to have strength, be approved by the national authority department of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (the supervision of insurance companies and banks within the country), and the shareholders should have a good style. As a insurance brokerage company, Xiaoyi Xiaoyi Insurance does not need to question the legitimacy of Xiaoyi Xiaoyi Insurance as long as there are these three thresholds.
At this point, it is not bad, it is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: the small umbrella insurance is a kind of insurance supermarket, many celebrities' superb disease insurance products are sold on this platform, such as the Super Mario 5 superb disease insurance, the insurer and the insured are both Huaxia Life, the small umbrella insurance is only a third-party mediator, and it is not questioned its reliability.
From the point of view of payment mode: Internet platform products are generally more cost-effective because they do not have the operating expenses of business points, and businessmen's salaries, so Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payments, reducing the payment pressure of the insured person, and maximizing the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
Consider it.
From the professionalism of businessmen: this is especially important, because insurance is a highly professional industry, and many online products can be self-purchased. This will lead to many misunderstandings in terms of health declaration and occupation. Non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective consciousness when they make a claim, believing that they are healthy or meet the requirements. This will lead to many potential risks of denial of insurance.
I have also done insurance telephone sales in "Tencent microinsurance" (just like Xiaoyiyuan, an Internet insurance brokerage platform), which is very responsible.
Internet insurance is real, reliable, and unreliable is people. Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, and there are many sales misunderstandings.
For example, 1 yuan insurance covers 600,000, and you can buy insurance and get a mobile phone for free, and you can get a 6 million-dollar guarantee for serious illness. These marketing strategies are right, but they avoid the main point and will not tell the insured people, the first month is 1 yuan, and the next month is a normal fee, between 50 and 200 yuan, and many customers have not known what they bought for two years.
He thought that he could spend 1 yuan and the insurance company would pay 600,000 yuan.
Free mobile phones are only sent to the last few digits of the policy number, such as 66666, 88888, etc., and if the winning text message is sent, you do not have to exchange or remind others.
For the insured person, this is another pit. Freeing up 60,000 insurance premiums is short-term, and if only relying on this, the insured person will not have other business insurance. In the event that the insured person suffers from a serious illness, 60,000 insurance premiums will not solve the problem, and the person's future life will begin to run amok.
At present, the misguidance of Internet insurance sales is also severely punished by the state.
Therefore, in general, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, and the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the businessmen.
It is suggested that the subject should consider comprehensively. In fact, many offline insurance brokers have a wider range of products, more opportunities for customers to choose, and some products are more competitive than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers, underwritten offline products, and saved each person 2000-3000 yuan/year.
If you have any questions, please communicate with me.
I said: I am a business insurance agent with 3 years of business management training experience, I have served more than 1,000 enterprises, and I have cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before signing, I will start from the customer's needs to customize insurance products for them, I will compare prices for them during the signing, and I will try my best to get the best insurance results for them. After signing, I will do the insurance document organization, insurance document custody, so that the customer can be sure and worry-free.
To grow together with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the topic!
According to the definition of the insurance supervision department, Internet insurance is a type of insurance business in which the insured person can complete all the insurance procedures after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insured person does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the insured person.
Although the online insurance contract has no "ceremony", and even may not have a printed paper contract, it does not affect the effectiveness and legal validity of the electronic contract.
This model is a little similar to "telephone sales", but such purchase of insurance will also have a fatal problem: subsequent services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about what kind of "mediator" we choose, and whether it is a long-term insurance "mediator" that can provide us with services for many years?

From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and insults, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eradicate this villain.
The first to be opposed is this uncivilized style.
From when you started to add me on Facebook, and then posted a joke post, to when you tried to post my place of birth and my father's name on social media, I have taken the attitude of not responding.
Afterwards, you have not only continued to tag me, but also continued to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook about some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, such as the comments about my appearance, body shape, good breeding, etc. I... It's enough.
I didn't know that later, I received a number of friends who sent me a Facebook friend's account uploaded a photo of you and contained sexual harassment elements.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't continue to be silent.
After I posted the news of my calling the police, you didn't stop, but instead became more and more arrogant.
I don't care about your political background or your status, in our society, we need to respect the two sexes.
Yes, you can continue this kind of humorous, indirect, humiliating, and insulting remarks, you can continue to say that you only care about me, you can continue to say that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not you made the picture or continue to publish all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't, and I also have no ability to stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and body shape don't need you to judge.
I don't even think there are any girls who would be willing to be humiliated by others in order to get famous.
My friend asked me, "How are you?"
I said, you will not believe.
I don't think there will be any girl who can say that she is okay after being bullied.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic morals will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of people.
I cut some comments for you to judge
Your post should not be impersonated by anyone.
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization

Here, there are a variety of home appliances and well-known brands.
On the 12th day of the second month of the year, I went to the "Hanson" water purifier store to see the water purifier. The store was doing an activity and the price was relatively cheaper.
居然之家 has 11 floors, from the second floor to the ninth floor, and the second floor and the first floor are both parking places. And the parking is free during the day!
The surrounding is not very good, and there are few hardware stores in the restaurant. And the restaurant has an average taste.
This elevator is also very frustrating, just like having a big illness, negative two to negative one, and going back and forth, and I can't stop at this level, from the safety channel down to the first floor, it is also very frustrating, directly to a furniture store, and the furniture store is closed, and the safety channel can't go out!

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporters Wang Xian) -- Chongqing Chilibei Water Green Comprehensive Service Area was completed and put into operation on October 10, which is the second Water Green Comprehensive Service Area in the upstream of the Yangtze River officially put into operation after the operation of the Chengdu Water Green Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan Province on August 10.
By now, the water green comprehensive service area has covered the Yangtze River upstream, middle and downstream.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Jiang River Navigation Administration Bureau, said that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built 10 green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by a large number of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the water green comprehensive service area is another milestone in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping. The Yangtze River ship pollution reception and shipping service capability have been significantly improved.
According to introduction, the water green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing all-round production and living services for ships and crew members, and helping them solve the problems of "urgency, difficulty, hope and expectation."
The two green comprehensive service areas in the upstream of the Yangtze River have been built and put into operation, integrating living services, production services and government affairs services into one, with the theme of green environmental protection and the specialty of ship maintenance and emergency rescue services, so that the ships in the Yangtze River can "land once and have a number of services", so that the crew members who sail in the Yangtze River can work more efficiently and live more conveniently.
U.S. three warships gather in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapons rarely visit the island of Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional, pro-Communist media report the latest news of China-US relations: The latest satellite images show that three U.S. warships are gathering in the vicinity of China. The U.S. media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy’s arsenal rarely visits the island of Guam, releasing an important signal to its allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the news of the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform", on January 9, the satellite found the US "USS Carl Vinson" (USS Carl Vinson) aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Strait of Malacca connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the West Pacific.
The platform predicts that the "Cal Vinson" will deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the "Carl Vinson" carrier has carried the F-35C fighter and the CMV-22 "Phantom" airborne transport aircraft.
The US航母, which is currently in the Pacific, includes the USS Carl Vinson, which left the United States on January 3, and the USS Abraham Lincoln, which left on January 3.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C aircraft中队 for the first time, which belonged to the 314th Air Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the "Republic" aircraft carrier (USS Ronald Reagan) docked in Yokohama, Japan.
The combat group includes the "Mississippi Lake" missile cruiser and the "Stockard" missile destroyer.
U.S. three warships gather in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapons rarely visit the island of Guam In January 2017, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three U.S. warships were gathering in the vicinity of China.
(Twitter @South China Strategic Situational Awareness) The United States has assembled three warships in the vicinity of China. The most powerful weapons have rarely visited the island of Guam in 2022. On January 17, the flight route of the US aircraft carrier-carrying transport aircraft CMV-22B.
According to CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy’s arsenal rarely visited Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada," loaded with 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
U.S. three warships gather in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapons rarely visit the island of Guam. Analysts said that this was a signal to its allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first time that the US ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016 and the second time it has been publicly visited since the 1980s.
U.S. three warships gather in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapons rarely visit the island of Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea in recent years.
The picture shows the Yongshui Island in the South China Sea.
(South China Sea Research Forum) In a statement, the US Navy said that the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada号”'s visit to the islands strengthened cooperation between the US and its allies in the region and showed the US's capabilities, flexibility and readiness for war.
The ballistic missile submarine is usually called a "bomber submarine".
The whereabouts of 14 "Raymarine" submarines in the US Navy are usually strictly confidential.
The secret of the ballistic missile submarine around the ballistic missile submarine has made the "Red Submarine" the "essential survival weapon of the nuclear three-in-one system", including the launch井 ballistic missile in the United States and the B-2 and B-52 bombers with carrying nuclear bombs.
Talking with friends about the recent decline of Meta by 26%, the market value evaporated by $25.1 billion, Zuckerberg responded that "we are facing unprecedented competition." Why?
Meta (originally Facebook) is actually a advertising company, and its income mainly comes from advertising. Today's profitable advertising company, it has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and other functions, regardless of their functions, are meta traffic channels.
In addition, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance". Many apps external Meta's ads are realized through Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta can no longer get the user's data and information, affecting the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is friendly to users, and will clearly indicate whether the App can obtain user's information. Most people's normal reaction is not to allow.
Next time if Google hits again, the impact on Meta's income will be even greater.
Second, the growth of Meta's income has weakened the Chinese factor (this factor's proportion is not certain, but it does exist).
People usually know that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mainly from companies contributing to its maritime business.
Meta has about a hundred people in Hong Kong and several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta are the advertising channels that cannot be bypassed. Most of the money is spent on Meta.
Interesting is that now Byte's TT is Meta's main competitor, but Meta made a lot of money from Byte in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping Byte to place ads there. Meta's performance in China is also very good.
I haven't specifically studied recently, but I won't get better than before.
The stage of massive spending overseas by Chinese companies has passed.
Third, the expansion of new flow channels has not been successful.
Facebook is getting older and older, and the new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market not only focuses on income, but also on the future expectations.
It is obvious that Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg talked about the "original universe."
It is indeed the direction of the future, but the realization cycle of the microcosm is relatively long. This story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the past two years.
Therefore, in the next two years, Meta should be a difficult period.
Although Facebook is now very prosperous, it earns as much as US$100 billion to US$200 billion every year. In fact, Facebook now has a very strong sense of crisis, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although his social software has a relatively high daily active user number and is also a mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has little confidence in the rapid development of TikTok.
And the concept of a mini universe, which is unachievable, has no hope of success in a short time. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous, which is also the reason why Zuckerberg changes the company's name again and again and keeps looking for new tracks, but I think his track choice is wrong and is a dead end. These are some of my thoughts, for reference.
