The goods cost under 20 euros.
The fee amounts to 40% of the value of the goods...
I am #PRS_ORG# and so it is not a problem for me.
Just a number or an instruction, so that it can be tracked back to you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249 euros.
It costs 179 euros today.
I find it really annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and order again for the better price or is there another option for signature?
In principle, I also think that children should not be held responsible for their little sister.
However, I find it good to take care of the little ones.
Quick glance, quick help, bring the bottle etc.
They learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as she can still be a mother, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is alone for a short time and it is OK for you, that is good.
You can best determine for yourself whether this is right for your children.
It is not so that he wickles K 2 and should sleep for hours.
It is probably unfair.
Perhaps the psychologist's statement will come as well.
Because if something actually happens like a fire, an earthquake, an alien invasion, etc., it would really be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk that you want to take is of course up to you;)
Help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a Crime / Thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title does not appeal to me anymore Maybe someone knows...
The story dealt with fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a sheepherder commits suicide by pouring milk over himself and jumping into a well.
The case will be handled by a commissioner, who will investigate the therapists who run the clinic where the patient is being treated.
The commissioner has a small amount of nicotine, which also has a fear (of fire), and this therapist lands.
There is more self-control and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is asked to go to the site of the massacre and document it and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it ultimately comes out that this therapist prescribes a kind of underlying therapy group where a chip is implanted in the patient's brain that suppresses an anxiety center and the patients ultimately have to put themselves in extreme situations.
(One woman jumps out of the window with intent to kill)
This is described in the book as "the fight".
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic where a fire had to be put out.
I am sure that the book was written in the original by a French author / author.
If this action is known to anyone, or if anyone can even give me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
First contact my man.
That can take time.
What steps should I then take?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Kind, 4 j. Splitter unter dem Daumennagel
Kind, four years, has over the entire length of wood splitter under the daumennagel (side).
They try to pull him with a pin.
Very difficult to hit.
Not beaten and done.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
It is tomorrow to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of Digitaldecoder and Soundmodul on a master plate, we achieve thicknesses of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can thus be installed almost anywhere in the spindle holes H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders will be offered at all reasonable prices, and will always come with a 11x15mm thick “zucchurrilo” according to the speaker.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multiprotocol decoder.
He dominates the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 addresses are automatically converted to 2- and 4-character addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoder automatically connects to a suitable digital centre.
He dominates all DCC program options and thanks to RailCom®, CV values can be calculated on the main line.
For central systems that can only program CVs from 1 to 255, a help register exists.
Motorola® Anwender profitieren von bis zu 28 Fahrtstufen bei 255 Adressen.
Three more Motorola addresses enable the release of 16 functions.
An embedded program mode makes it possible to program the Control Unit 6021 as well.
The M4 protocol allows an automatic submission to mfx® compatible central servers.
The LokSound 5 decoder detects the Märklin® Bremsstrecken as well as ZIMO® HLU Bremsbefehle or the Lenz® ABC System.
Smoke with DCC fire extinguishers or with equalization is also possible.
In addition, he also has a Selectrix® Bremsdiode.
An ABC escalator allows the automatic escalation between two platforms.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used with analog input signals.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to prevent strikes
Politics and science in Great Britain are concerned about ever new micron cases.
As a result, all qualified adults in England will receive an intake allowance.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to get on top of the coronavirus outbreak as quickly as possible, despite rapidly rising Covid figures.
Every adult in England should already have received the opportunity by the end of the year, a booster dose if they have been given the second dose at least three months ago, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a video message to his countrymen.
So far, the yield date is at the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to speed up the campaign in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
As a result of the Omikron variant, a situation of emergency has been declared, which means that the impact protection must be intensified, Johnson said.
The good news is that with a third dose, the level of protection could be increased again.
Let us now cheer up, said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more micron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, the increase was 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price?
Ich bin dafür, dass alle sich mit pronomen vorstellt
I have sent an application.
Today, the invitation came via email.
I want to respond to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but something more complicated.
I have fallen in love with him and, depending on where he / she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I don't know how to write an email now.
Could you please help me?
**I am a foreigner and I do not want to see any officials.
Conclusion: everyone should use pronominals.
Have a total of 5 books.
There are four of them.
I only bought one today
Obviously, the chair had a not inconsiderable lack of sales.
How can this happen after 9 months?
First on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it is already working since ca.
No more than 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books on the website and then read them on #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there is no more.
They are now available again and I want to add them to your order and put them on your invoice.
[CW] The feeling of not being able to help.
Content warning: I will write something about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something from the heart.
I (21) often come in contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence.
One topic that really bothers me and is too often mentioned is that many victims do not want to help themselves or think we could not help them.
I am completely clear that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that make me more moved than if I could do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue flecks, the blood, the exhausted eyes...
But even in conversation with four eyes, with the perpetrator far away from sight and hearing, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear of pain, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of the children from this.
If I wanted to make it clear to everyone what I wanted to do, I would be very close to tears, everyone deserves to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to accept just violence.
I often wish I could help... I know I can't.
Never mind.
Please always think of it as worth it to live without violence, that is so important.
Arcane on Netflix: What does the series take to League of Legends?
Much fantasy, many complicated names, a dazzling spectacle: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has just been launched on Netflix.
Why are we so happy about the already announced two episodes?
Baseball Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on youngster Johannes Patrick.
Again nothing: The Riesen in Crailsheim lost again for the second time within not more than three months - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with a view to the cup defeat at the beginning of October at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have a little bit of anger in our belly."
After the game, however, she did not fall - but again refused to sign after the 61.72 (28.38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
However, the fact that more than the naked result the type and way of the performance disappointed.
The substitute is a statistic that sums up the entire dilemma. The triple-quarter gave just 13 percent, four goals (all by the young Johannes Patrick) and 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was given by John Patrick: "We were not focused enough after the victory at Teneriffa and we did not implement what we trained for."
Then the ball.
His opponent, Sebastian Gleim, responded quite differently: "To win a clever game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
It felt like 10,000 people."
Only 750 spectators were allowed to attend on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came for free.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team to victory.
The best player I have trained, Gleim praised.
While in the Patricks team, the performance strugglers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) were on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Riesen prevent a total debacle and came away with eight points after they had already lost 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
For a long time, there was no chance of a comeback.
Already on Wednesday (7 p.m.), the Riesen receive Skyliners Frankfurt, and then also in Ludwigsburg, a maximum of 750 spectators.
We had a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already reported myself to some months.
Unfortunately, all performance claims were rejected.
We have once again been informed legally and have therefore again written them.
We have already reported to the authorities a half year ago.
Stets wie aus dem Ei gepantet: Max Raabe wird 59
He wants to seduce his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on the road with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he can.
Max Raabe originally wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig on Sunday.
But there is nothing there.
The planned concert was cancelled in May 2022 - "with the consent of the authorities" to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for Advent time will have to wait, as it says on the website of the singer, who is now 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchestra.de).
From January, the artists want to collect their 2020 term papers because of the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe already as a youngster had a lot of fun.
He studied opera singing in Berlin in 1986, and together with friends he founded the Palast Orchester.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the comedian harmonists.
He was often marked with prices.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - exactly as his success album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) did - second place in the charts.
He has created it from the bottom up.
From the current German music scene, Max Raabe is no longer recognisable.
Since 2020, he has been on tour with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück". dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small souvenir from the furniture fair?
It will be supplemented with existing furniture and so we can control whether it looks good
It still doesn't work, but I can still see the deck.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: There is no new housing through the agreement
The new Federal Minister of the Environment, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the establishment of large housing corporations, as demanded in Berlin in a popular vote.
Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday) that "with an agreement, there is not one new apartment, but only the ownership structure."
My goal is to provide tenants with security that their rent will remain affordable in the years to come.
For example, a dark mix of private landlords, joint ventures or housing companies is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition from SPD, Greens and the Left Party wants to set up an expert commission, as was done with the result of the people's vote.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz's talks with the FDP will not end with the Ampel coalition.
The coalition agreement envisages a rent freeze until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in densely populated areas and the extension of the rental period.
I will talk to the Justice Minister to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not respond, "we will talk to our coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 killed in tornadoes in Kentucky
With a devastating storm system, many tornadoes have been caused by the US.
More than 100 people could be killed in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there remind me of a war zone.
In the night of Saturday in the USA, several tornadoes caused severe damage and may have killed up to a hundred people.
The storm leaves a roughly 320-kilometer-long area of snow, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Those governors Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, all over, where the tornado tore through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just out.
Some of the industrial plants, chimneys are in the buildings.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible at all.
He is alone in the state of Kentucky with up to a hundred dead, official figures are climbing.
Hello, I just saw that she sold the Vitrine #NAME#.
That is very sad.
Will it still be produced?
Or is she completely out of stock?
Is it possible to order this window in another country?
When will you come?
If the delivery cannot take place in my home, I must cancel the order!
I understand that I can only order the ceiling now and send it to Germany, where it is in the warehouse?
I had sent back an article on the contact form and received a reply, and wanted to know if it had been received or if it had been processed, as I had not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay bonuses and change advertising
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for an insurance premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees money for the treatment.
In doing so, they are on a line with social partners such as the ÖGB and the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, who today call for financial incentives for an injection.
The design of advertising slogans to call for donations - following the example of Germany - should increase the willingness to donate to coronavirus donations.
He was transferred to a different company.
That makes his situation not better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He has not stuck to his old position at all and has sought something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you: not at all.
He also found his job not good.
There are too many variables.
They kindly accept the cancellation.
That will then be relevant legally.
I take a screen shot.
Good day - I have an interest in the Boone Esstisch, Weiß.

Help with first campaign
Boron to the core!
I am going to milk just for a group of four friends the fun over the Greifenpass and want to lead my heroes into a campaign written just for them.
We play DSA 5.
The big question is being made, the obstacles and their motivations are being written, the individual acts are being prepared and now I am here to write about the competition and I am already excited about the first meeting.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a wheelbarrow full of gold coins to a small village near the Thuran river.
There should be further action there.
Some miles from the village, a group of goblins are to be let loose and locked in a fortress.
I want to give the players the opportunity to get to grips with different forms of confrontation: Understand, act, threaten, detect the danger early on, which always affects the players.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with axes and swords
As soon as they are not noticed, the goblins climb the heroes in a halo and flank them on the left and right, while two with spears stop the wheel.
If it comes to fighting and the heroes fall, I have two solutions
1: The heroes find all unconscious and bleeding from the son of the schoolmaster, a half-brother, and heals them.
The cat is definitely gone.
If a defeat is unavoidable, this half of the field with two of its corners will attack and come to the aid of the heroes in the battle.
The Karren is still there, everything is super.
How does Deus ex Machina keep its solution 2 secret?
Is the encounter as an introduction to fun too much?
The Goblin group will play an important role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.
Edited: wow, I had not calculated with so many answers, especially not with so many good suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee many more ideas, and now I have even more trust in my narrative.
I still have the lamp.
And again together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to send them back
Can you then leave the pillow, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I am a fan of Sky Sport F1
Hello love F1 fans, the quality on the German sky has increased over the season, so I want to make a little air with this post.
For the first time today, the transmission was interrupted in the F2 race in order to start the F1-update in time.
It was true that the delayed start and the start accident delayed the planning, but one could still show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons the F 1 priority is granted and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky DE did not have a choice.
Still, despite Sky UK taking on the race, it's a step in the right direction.
Still a small nod: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation with the serious accident.
Then there was again a rule of thumb among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of whom did not know that one could switch to a red flag.
Although this situation has already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that Verstappen can change the tires as necessary to this topic on Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that this is the opportunity for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that such elementary rules should be known when commenting on F1 on pay TV.
It is not the first time that this has happened, according to rules, or proposed, both have just been unstable in the topic of rules.
In general, Roos's commentary style does not appeal to me, but that is not the point.
But I really like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
There are stand-alone B&Bs that just look unprofessional, like the order of coffee at (alarm-free) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the last one brings a lot of unrest in the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least is the advertising taking place on Sky, where Sky is the only TV channel that goes into the advertising, as you can follow F1TV after the race only in German.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF does that.
These two broadcasters also make less advertising than Sky in training, and as a free-to-air broadcaster.
It is true that one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but this does not allow me to see the consequences.
The entire program of Sky Sport F1 is also very long and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is really the worst German TV channel that adds F1.
Unfairly, RTL makes it a better job for the four races they still have to win.
So anyway, the grandiose F1 season makes a lot less fun than it would be with a decent TV station.
Mich würde mal eure Meinung interessieren.
Here: #PRS_ORG#-pendelleuchte, Messing und mehrfarbrig Glas x 1
Hello, I have an article that should have been delivered last week and is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, and the Second Lady told me yesterday that she will send an email and never get an answer.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on December 12, 2019.
One of them has already shown a defect after relatively short time (the material has a hole in the upper part of the sleeve).
I request support.
Lighthouse pumps are ready to supply an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to control a filter system over the air.
This series is offered in 3 variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
Here you can see the performance compared.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run all the equipment at once.
If you own a large aquarium, you can use pumps with two or more outlets so that you can connect several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model, but the Lüfterpumpe also offers to set an accent in the aquarium, for example with a fan (you can find it in our shop) or with a decor, which transforms the air blisters into a function.
Here would be a treasure, mussel or something similar.
The MK series has a special, hammered construction and thus ensures low maintenance costs.
The installation is very simple.
The Lüfterpumpe is connected to an air pump 4/6 mm...and it can already move.
The Lüfterpumpe should be the same, or higher than the water level and should be visible outside.
If the air pressure is lower than the water level, you should open a vent.
The air flow is simply widened and the ventilation is then adjusted.
This would prevent if a single drop of water backflowed, which the water from the creek flows through the pump...
If the Lüfterpumpe in the open is to be used, so should you, as other Lüfterpumpen are, covered and protected against fire
The pumps of the MK series are just power packets that consume little energy
Even if we put the processing time at 3 days on eBay, the packages will be packed and delivered here every day.
Everything is going well, it is very fast.
We just want to prepare a little bit, so that no one is surprised, just because it took longer than expected.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for the entire staff, who also work in the expeditions sector...of course here does not stop Corona.
Please do not rate it bad just because the delivery is delayed, which is only due to the package service.
Of course you are happy about these services, even if we are saying at the moment... that they are really difficult
This is also very different regionally.
Do not be cruel, stay healthy, and we all hope that it will also be better times.
How long does it take to get a glowing with and without arm?
Can you also order the legs here?
Amazon founder sends astronauts' daughter and moderator to the world
The daughter of the first US-American in history, a TV host and four other passengers have embarked on a short flight into space.
They were transported on Saturday from the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the ten-minute flight were found in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos personally greeted the freshly returned astronauts after their return.
Welcome back, Bezos said in a blue suit, as he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers emerged and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of astronaut Alan Shepard, who was flown into space by Nasa in 1961, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were among the company's guests, who had paid for their tickets: Space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how many they each paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled the short flight to the mission of her father.
He has to work hard and have to do everything himself.
She is just like that, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his excitement.
He would like to go back to the All again, said the moderator.
New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometers
The "raketensystem" "New Shepard" is largely automated.
The capsule, which separated during the flight from the rocket, reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the earth, at times with great speed, before the reusable object plummeted from great heights and landed.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers over the earth as a limit to the world, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third successful all-out flight of Blue Origin. In July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old German.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was there, known worldwide for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's deputy CEO, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of promoting the business of travel tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.
By pressing a button, you can determine unambiguously whether your "smart stone" is permanently lit in a color or whether you want to play through its entire color range.
When switched on, the LED light bulb emits a light color for around one minute, before it dims to its most decorative color.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone"-Leuchte is always impressive in the open.
In cooler surroundings, their light even becomes particularly good – just think of how long it takes for the days to shorten.
In winter, please only ensure that no snow disables the solar module in its function.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the AA format, which can be charged when needed.
You can refer to our webshop and extend the service life of your decoys even further.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry
I am currently studying Biochemistry in the first semester and find the profession actually quite exciting and also in the laboratory I am not (I already have the organic chemistry practice behind me).
I have of course already informed myself about career prospects before the study, but I also thought at the time that I wanted to study until I got promoted.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially because of the job prospects.
On one side (Studycheck etc) you always hear super-qualified applicants and the job is completely sought after, on the other side you always hear about unemployed biologists and unpaid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested in:
(1) What is your current work?
(2) Are you satisfied with your work/employment?
(3) Was habt ihr studiert / Welche Ausbildung hat ihr gemacht?
(4) Do you still want to do it again?
Many thanks for your answers!
I am currently uncertain and may drop out of university in 2022 and do an apprenticeship to become a specialist in information technology.
If she has experience, she will write it too:)
Extra stress before holidays and festival weekends
This topic came to me last week.
However, I had to use my long weekend to get over it.
It is only a matter of time now.
There is a lot of stress at work not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays.
As it seems, there are also more brisk days ahead of the celebrations.
It was as follows: Last week was Mariä Himmelfahrt, which in Switzerland is called "Auffahrt".
On Friday, most people and businesses do a half-day break, which is semi-official.
There was also a long four-day weekend at home last week.
What happened last week?
All stress.
Lauter E-mails, which had to be sent out immediately, order here, order there, everything before the long weekend.
Because... yes?
Because "next week then" after so much time and that can't be?
Or because people want to give up so much in a compressed week as much as in a normal one?
I was angry not only on Wednesday, but also violently indignant.
What should this self-congratulation be about?
So then we still have celebrations when we are not allowed to!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very self-assured.
My question is: Are we alone, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed evangelical art?
Or does she know about it in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld celebrates Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is happy at Christmas in her thuringian homeland - but has not yet made any plans.
The beauty, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will go to the festival and spend some time with her son.
I love it, said Catterfeld.
But she still has a lot to overcome: "For the first time, I don't have any expectations, I have to make a decision now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a waste-free disposal of the Mauser and the recharging of the batteries.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg Biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a glossy and shiny feeder.
The majority of the damage caused in the harvesting operation can be attributed to errors in feeding.
Since the feeder consists of a non-toxic substance, a particularly rich and nutritious diet for the formation of a free-flowing pellet is necessary.
For a functional exchange of nutrients, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the weaning period are due to poor or insufficient feeding with vitamins and minerals.
When NEKTON-Bio is combined, the unnatural ratio of amino acids in most plant-based fertilizer is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
While the use of NEKTON Bio should not involve any further vitamin preparations.
NEKTON-Bio is completely biodegradable and can be flushed down the toilet or poured over sewage.
Thank you, I found it
Still not working
DDR maintenance model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the Lok was in Schlesien and Mitteldeutschland in use, and the very rare Lok probably originated from the design of the locomotive ME Heft 11/1968, which was used with steam locomotives and freight trains, see photos, good function, The E 95 is a heavy goods train locomotive of the German Railways (DRG), which has been equipped for the traction of heavier coal trains in the Scheldt network, possibly also from the small locomotive firm ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are able to operate it
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn Company commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that should be able to carry 2,200 tons of coal and 530 tons of passengers at a speed of 45 kilometers per hour.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined that the delivery of the locomotive as 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with diesel-electric drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 27, 1927 to June 28, 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which bore the business number E 95 01-06.
They all survived the Second World War and then found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were repaired in the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the project to improve the country's rail network in Dessau, all six locomotives were tested.
[4] When the demand for heavy-duty locomotives for the heavy goods service increased with the rapid electrification of the Middle-Eastern network, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were modified in 1959, with the remaining locomotives serving as spare parts.
First, the existing E 04, E 44 and E 94 were removed.
Only when the E 94 was stopped was it possible to prevent the workforce from being reduced further.
[4] First, the locomotives were stationed in the railway station in Leipzig.
They arrived in 1960 at the Halle P.
They were used in a self-paced route from the Eiseltal in Richtung Kohlenzügen in Halle, Leipzig und Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated regulation of the locomotives becomes more apparent.
So it came to pass that Schütze had to live with Schalthandlungen.
Then the man on this locomotive, who has been on this locomotive all the time with hammer and chisel, had to remove the shackles during the journey again.
The damage to the locomotive engines was more serious and led to month-long outages of the locomotive.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new locomotives available, and a clear trend towards electrification was not planned at that time, the German Railways were able to use old locomotives and the majority of locomotive traction sets, so that the E 95 was not used.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn Elektrolokomotiven only wanted to take on single-handedly, which would have caused a problem in operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the sight displays on the driver's side.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were removed in mid 1969, the E 95 01, which left the service on October 5, 1970, followed.
The intended new code 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives were stopped on the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a locomotive depot at Halle Hauptbahnhof.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichbahn were convinced that the E 95 as museum locomotive is worth preserving.
In 1979, the first rigorous preparation of the locomotive began, with the goal of presenting it to the public in Dessau in raw form.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden traffic museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
In the Halle (Saale) DB Museum, the locomotive is on display.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have worked on the maintenance of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the museum in Arnstadt, with new interior and more comfortable seating. The transformers were checked and five locomotive engines were functional.
Until 1945, the locomotives were on the Schlesische Gebirgsbahn and the accompanying sidings in use, where they relied on their reliable work and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were moved to the Middle East network after Leipzig.
Initially, the service area was Schlesien
Work model H0 in OVP, function good, it is necessary to have optical repairs at the location in own work, engraved, with sport animals, Kellergut!!!, very rarely a work model, very small expense - maybe the turnover also comes from the small series firm ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packages can show labels and lagers.
Yes, the F-Teile are it
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle ball is held by two fingers. Unfortunately, these are too short and the ball cannot be mounted on the fingers.
What do we do now?
I can't move the bed.
The middle barrel is held by two screws, which are unfortunately not accurate.
The middle-weight does not pass through the intended halter.
I also got new ones.
When will they be released?
No, not white.
According to the montage director, they were the real thing, they were just too short
But that's equal.
The main purpose is to fulfill their purpose
They are not flat
Could I get this?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a house in Oberbayern.
On Sunday, the police announced that a six-figure damage had occurred in the euro area.
The fire had spread from a carport to the neighbouring house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
According to the information, two residents were taken to the hospital with slight smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not rule out the possibility of arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
But it comes much later
And I have to pay again for shipping costs
To combat fake news - Biontech CEO publishes an impromptu photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first injection on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021
Until now, Biontech chef Uğur Şahin has not publicly announced his divorce.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo of his corona test.
The death of a friend has moved him, Sahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainzer's Biontech company, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving an injection against the coronavirus.
Social media contained false information that I allegedly did not sign.
In fact, my wife and I received three professors from the Biontech-Pfizer Institute, wrote Şahin on Friday in a LinkedIn post.
For a few months, friends have been pushing me to take a photo in which I will be wearing a mask to counteract this false rumor.
So far, he has rejected this, because the communication should not have focused on him.
But one call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply moved when I realized that an old school friend is currently fighting for my life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not impressed, wrote Şahin further.
He did not ask for the reasons.
However, "the most common cause seems to be fear, often caused by inaccurate information and lack of trust".
Fear only works with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
In an interview with the German Welle, Uğur Şahin says he is not married.
However, the video was released in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself stated.
At that time, Şahin said: "It is not allowed by law at the moment to obtain the impurity itself."
There is a priority in Germany for the eradication of the disease.
By now, the prioritisation has long been lifted - and the chief executive of BioNTech has said that three times.
Fire in underground structure: Ten thousand people without electricity
In many municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday: no more electricity and in many cases no heating either.
There was a fire station.
After a fire with serious damage in an underground station, thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to wait around 24 hours without light.
On the evening of the fire, 41,000 people were affected in several municipalities.
The Versorger Westnetz reported that on Saturday, numerous power aggregates in operation were completely disrupted by the large-scale disturbance until late in the evening.
Firefighters and volunteers from the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered support in schools and called for help from neighbouring communities.
The donor thanked those affected for their patience and those helping for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also apologize to the affected communities, the district, the fire department and the THW for the unnecessary deployment," said Florian Witt, head of the Primärtechnik department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will still take a few days, as the Westnetz equipment could not be put back into service at first, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Strom flies again
According to the information from Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at around 19.15 hours has damaged parts of the 10,000-volt power system in Neunkirchen-Seelscheid.
Here, repairs and maintenance are necessary.
In addition, a connection to a 30,000-volt power line has been made.
With the help of these bypasses, the electricity supply is again restored.
Since Saturday, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power back.
Further 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were evacuated step by step from 21.30.
Since 23:15, the victims of the accident have also been affected by the electricity.
More than 80 Westnetz and partner companies were in use.
The authorities had also called for assistance to neighbors after the construction of a power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
It is now important that citizens in their neighbourhood take care of older or alone people and inform the local fire department if help is needed, explained Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The residents of Altenheimen were mainly in the focus when it came to setting up and operating Notstrom aggregates.
In addition, according to the authorities, emergency accommodation has been set up in schools for those people who were unable to provide themselves or who require medical treatment in particular.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold.
Can I buy and pay for it in euros?
It is the dayscaped #PRS_ORG# in blue.
I hope you have a beautiful day and stay healthy ♡
I can't mount that on the table.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are three demonstrations.
We wanted those with a table with a diameter of #NUMBER#
We have 155 cm of thickness.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I cannot take it home and thus reduce it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise I have to send them back as they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy about a reply
That's really easy!
Then we do it!
Do you want me to send you the final image by mail?
The repair is now complete.
I already tried this before the chat.
However, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG# before the purchase.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low rating almost unacceptable.
We are not agreed
Nordic combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combination Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to victory at the World Cup in Estonia's Otepää.
The duo had to give up once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the ski jump in the Loipe with great anticipation.
Return the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both made and used the version 4.5...
It can be assumed that they have already encountered problems
It seems that it was also bought with my #PRS_ORG#.
If I open it, ups!
This document could not be opened.
It is possible that the file is missing in the customer service.
If I can recognize it, it is an #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me further?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I must also work!
To ensure that the paint job is evenly and clean, you should rinse the parts with a little bit of stubble, fat and fingernail polish, and clean them with clear water.
Before you bring the pinwheel the first time with a new color, it is recommended to have 2 to 3 stripes.
You can do this on the later visible side of the components or in a jug.

Take out each needed decal and stick it to you.
Decorative stickers are also called "wasserschiebebilder", because you can see the reverse side with water, until the paper through the nose gets dark.
Then you only cut a small piece of paper and put it on the corresponding place on the model (which you have also previously requested).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you take the paper away.
Attention: Check that the image is actually sitting before you drop it completely from the paper, so it doesn't grow on your finger, knit or even tear.

Warning not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short period of time, after which I no longer read the book and must withdraw and register and load the book again and search where I have read it.
AM Samstag habe ich schon mal mit Ihnen kommuniziert.

Because the lamp came in 3 individual packages to me
Still, thank you!
Then I'll buy elsewhere once the money is back.
Do I get the problem solved?
Kinderwunschbehandlung bei PKV/Was ist ein "Versicherungsfall"?
Hello together,
We were a few times in childbirth treatment, but now that it is about delivery with the PKV, this suddenly stops.
The sequence is:
We had applied for the PKV in advance and received the permission over 3 attempts.
The attempts were limited (e.g. by time frames, success, etc.)
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and carried out two unsuccessful attempts, but this has not been successful with the PKV.
We again appealed for the cost of the PKV and were again granted three further attempts.
After a few further attempts (we have carried out more attempts than specified, logistically, the most expensive with the PKV) we arrive at the bill for the PKV and received the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2 + 3), the PKV only needs 3 attempts.
The explanation: The first two attempts were made with the help of prostitution or birth.
The second child birth is a new insurance case.
However, according to AGB, "the insurance risk begins with the treatment of the disease, and it ends when treatment is no longer necessary."
The questions to the experts here are:
* Who has the right to do the PKV (only 3 attempts are allowed) or us (there are 5 attempts to make)?
* Did the PKV have to point out to us that with a birth the further attempts failed?
* Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance risk?
The infertility (due to blocked oviducts) is not caused by the first child.
It would be super if the experts would give their opinion here.
Many thanks for your help!
Could you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can find them again best?
In order.
We will no longer order anything from them.
If they add the fees from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously have lost a good customer.
They should pass this on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleagues told me that the refund was processed and now you tell me that I only have to wait for it.
I can certainly not do anything about the fashion completely
Can you please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote?
It is clear and obvious that the refund was made and I still have not received a refund per #PRS_ORG#
She can instruct her manager that she has now lost two regular sessions.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our living room.
We will no longer do this.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must be used in a normal way.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell him as an office chair.
Unabhängig davon gilt der Gewährleistung von 24 Monaten.
No, it is not possible for me to have another kind of packaging.
I will get rid of the debt and be able to put it to the transnational company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are sold at a premium, but unfortunately we cannot find them for you.
Can they help?
Top of the week: The best low budget films
What exactly is a low-budget film, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no financing from a major film studio or private investor.
On the internet, you can find a wealth of low-budget films, such as Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What do you think about it?
And you probably don't care at all?
With a very good collection of furniture, two homes have already been completely furnished with their furniture.
Wanted the best price for the leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery was once again delayed, is this now certain?
Many thanks
With friendly greetings
If there is no telephone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...I will then get back to it soon because it just doesn't work here.

Half-Sieg against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Russian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Pressedienst (epd).
The EU did not resolve the confrontation, the researcher of the Berlin-based Science and Politics Foundation (SWP) explained.
This situation - Belarus is not quite small, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably go on for a while.
The approach to the people on the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
It seems that there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole does not decide to do so, this costs the fundamental rights.
This development is in contrast to the cohesion in the Union.
She apparently cannot understand when a member state puts its head in the sand and does not do what needs to be done, as currently Poland, which does not once accept the EU border protection agency Frontex's access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy will be negotiated, as the line of "boundary protection, boundary protection, boundary protection" has been strengthened.
New attempt to cross the border
According to Polish border guards, migrants are again trying to reach Poland via Belarus.
On Sunday, 55 migrants were arrested and brought back to the border, a spokesperson for the authority said.
The Polish officials were beaten by the migrants with stones in the incident.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, 52 attempted to cross the border within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border.
In recent months, thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko of holding power in Minsk, threatening to enter the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania reported border cuts.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners are arriving in refugee camps to prevent attacks there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
′′ Since then, the EU has thrown its market power into the trash and its determination has been proven, with harsh penalties and extraterritorial sanctions to operate ".
Ministry of Foreign Affairs must also take into account political costs.
The Belarusian society is not convinced that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial F1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is expected to have two brake failures during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial F1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has appealed.
The silver medals equate to two world records in the last Grand Prix of the year.
The protest is related to a supposed mistake by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he should have crossed the line.
Another appeal was filed at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the last race in the Mercedes and was preparing for his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver occurred shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the driver from behind overtook him.
I check it.
I speak with the bank and come again to you
Thanks for the support

In addition, there were cheeses for drinks and sausages.
The backbones of this day were rotten and white.
Fushle, Ed Euromaus and many red air ballons were perfect for the perfect curtain," said the park.
Since the beginning of the 90s, the cooperation between the Federal League and the Freizeitpark in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has already existed.
At the first SC Freiburg game in the Europa Park on Friday, the partnership has once again shown how well it works.
Strahlende Fans, who together have fun in the back, prove it, says Jürgen Mack, Europe Park owner.
Why is the €#NUMBER# and not as originally 1699 €?

Judith Hermann from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" literary tour, author Judith Hermann visited the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also served as a moderator.
She is gone, lives in a house on the coast, and is sensitive to the nocturnal cries of her front door.
I sent the contact form yesterday, but did not receive an email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request has been accepted.
Not everyone has the time for your broken chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, not all from our budget.
Contact woman #NAME#.
I can't talk to them every day
We agreed yesterday that I or my wife #NAME# will receive an email with a 60-euro voucher, a renewed order of the #PRS_ORG# night table and a pillowcase.
This email has not yet arrived.

Sorry, but only because he says it is not antisemitism.
It is as if he said nothing against foreigners.
They will not accept it.
But colleagues are constantly reproducing antisemitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just leave it completely.
Yes, then you're not as serious as your colleague.
Anyone who seriously questions the evolution is basically lost.
For that reason, a God has brought it all together.
But as soon as you become a creationist, you must believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science has lost its meaning.
And so you are not to take it any further than your colleagues
The lupe should be as close as possible to the eye to keep a good visibility.
The specially flattened-chromatic Linsensystem allows you to use the Lupe practically free of charge in the rural area.
Lupes are often marked with aggravating circumstances.
However, these data only apply to exact specifications, which are rare in use.
In order to use your lipstick optimally, we ask you to pay attention to the indications in the table "Technical Data" (see Use Guide in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - also on impact glasses - there are light reflections.
Through an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When using the optimal conditions for use - Lupe is dark in front of the eye - reflections on the lenses are less noticeable.
You can find further information in the handy use certificate (in German and English).

Tannen sale in Schönwolde: In the community of Krembz women are looking for Christmas decorations
Landwirt Frank Diers has already experienced such a strange situation at tanning.
Once a man is supposed to go home alone without his partner, because they cannot agree.
Every year, he grows 2000 plants.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a strange situation.
This always makes the eve time more exciting, he says.
And with the certificate?
I am leaving as a customer?!
After all, I have received a defective delivery and now I have to pay the full price for it.
Then I'll rate it accordingly!
We don't need discussions about the best court, but some similarity exists between the two.
Both consist of meat, which is cooked on a rotating spit.
And both have their names.
In German, for example, it could be an equivalent to the "dreher", which does not sound so funny.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass entrance in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously, I had an DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo's DLan, which up to a couple of outages transmitted 50 Mbit free of charge.
The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and on the DLan Modul, which is connected to the FritzBox, these are also received.
However, on the other DLan module, which sends the WiFi, not anymore the full 500, but rather I remove the module in my house, so less comes in (also use a stack dose that uses 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms of the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new glass fiber connection is now even slower than before (~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which seems to use a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "missing" through glass fibre?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely wasteful to still have LAN cables in the house.
I am really surprised that I have created an extra account here.
Therefore, I would be more pleased with an answer.
When is the time to change the giro account?
If you think that now is the time to think about the Giro Contest, you are mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to increase their fees, the fees for negative interest rates are also increasing.
For example, Deutsche Bank would have to be relatively large with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has reduced the gratuity to just half and even refunded the day's wage.
In a first step, the limit was only for customers of the Group Spare Postbank - at 50,000 euros for Giro and Advance accounts and at 25,000 euros for daily account accounts.
However, these lower fees apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "renewed individual associations with brand customers."
The Commerzbank had already moved to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as with ING Germany.
The Directbank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has cut its free transfers in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
After all: More than 100 banks now have a share of 25,000 euros or less after figures from the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda Bank in Berlin has also accepted 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with consumer centres, which in first instance have even obtained legal advice against this ruling.
Now it is already being discussed in the banks whether the institutes should be allowed to form reserves - for the case that the upper institutes also have to explain the negative interest rates in principle and have to refund many millions of bank customers.
The table for 8 people instead of 6 was delivered.
That is for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston has a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is one of climbing and trekking.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman in Hollywood by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, who caused a sensation in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show," this success is the result of a lot of discipline and work.
To her appearance, a whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers are responsible.
After all, so Aniston, you can have a chip on your shoulder (yes, really: a single chip from the box).
It is really a wonder that she still manages to fly the hearts of both female and male fans.
Maybe because she just had a lucky break - and is still looking for the big love.
And the baby's wish from the list has been fulfilled.
She was constantly asked when she would finally become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked have no idea what with me personally, medically, why I cannot.
It was really cold.
Keep hoping that success and glory will come.
Unworthy end of a career for Räikkönen
Kimi Räikkönens withdrawal from Formula 1 is still easier than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and winked at the crowd.
That was it.
After a tire failure and a light band of damage, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after not more than half the distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the Motorsport class.
His wife Minttu and the two children went to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönens biggest success was the 2007 World Championships in Ferrari.
He won 21 grand prix races, started 18 times from the pole position and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich holt 60. Weltcupsiege - Nolte siegt im Zweierbob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobpilot.
I just figured it out, I had to win one to two matches a season, then I could do it in Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who in the Winterberg races won two out of two in two days.
On Saturday, he first stopped the attack by Johannes Lochner, in which he drove from third to first.
Then, he changed something on the material setting and made a bigger advance on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team-mates Thorsten Margis (SV Halle) and Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he defeated Brad Hall.
Third was the Österreicher Benjamin Maier.
We are taking on a greater risk today and have been rewarded, said Friedrich, who also scored his 22nd goal in a row.
The Berchtesgaden native Johannes Lochner, who is driving for Stuttgart, came second in this race.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place in the first race.
If I knew what he does, I would do it too, said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Japan
At the women's event, Laura Nolte won the third victory of the season in two bob.
After only fourth place in the Monobob on the previous day, she raced to the world cup victory on Sunday with coach Deborah Levi.
Two-time Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thüringen came second to Germany's Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She took the first place in this winter after her Olympic qualification.
The Wiesbaden woman Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me, it was supercool, the first place in the world cup, I am super happy that Mariama is taking me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but today's start times were okay," said Burghardt, stressing that "it is not only jumps, but there is also a lot to do with drums."
Jamanka shrieked a little about the not entirely faultless driving, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the ceiling already in the warehouse and now I can buy it!!!
What should I do?
I have not received him and therefore cannot release him because I finally asked.
Last year, I had completely different problems and never had time.
And now it was revealed that I was very upset.
Look at the chat, it was about the Asare Sitzbank.
I want to give it back and then order again, because it is already reduced :)
Why does the delivery only start on 16.3.
There was no such long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tip over
He was dismissed yesterday by his colleague.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered waste.
But we still want the royal module, just a new unblemished
And not the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello beautiful girls and girls and women,
I just want to write something and maybe it will work...
I am 24 years old, have a part-time job, a full-time student and a dog - aside from the fact that my dog does not bark or goes to the kindergarten.
My friend (since 6 years) is sick, has a fever of 2 grades and is depressed (but now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I wanted to see and feel him, we chatted a lot and it was nice.
I have helped him with the donkey (because hand is in the association of fire).
He is cold to the bone, and we are currently seeing less (1 - 2 x a week) what makes me feel alive and loved.
My dog has diarrhea, I have given him some poultice and he is lying in his belly now and is getting a little better after I put the warm compress on him.
I love being alone with my sister and mother, and she's already gone for a month.
Now we are also getting on with housework, which we are naturally doing.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is completely well treated, I am halfway well treated and coming back.
Not good, but I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is asking for a lot (for me), and tomorrow at 15:00 I will have a written test for which I haven't prepared anything and tomorrow afternoon Anatomy class for which I should prepare at least a little.
And next week, on Tuesday, I will have a boring examination, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no place left.
My week also goes like this: Only until the weekend, then the weekend.
But then does that go on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the holidays begin.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it stays forever.
I believe that I'm just as stressed out as everyone else, because otherwise I wouldn't need these emotional cues.
I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I don't...
Do you also go?
True, I am incredibly grateful that I do not have to work.
In fact, I can't help but thank you.
I don't know if I would have survived otherwise.
I believe that this has something to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I would definitely find love here...
I wish you a pleasant evening, the week is almost over!
Today I received my order, unfortunately the whole other color plus the top surface is scratched and the table leg has scuffs.
In the first delivery, the colour was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we sit down now, will I get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on December 26th.#NUMBER#.
In the next two.
She was not confirmed.
It was completely different: At the time, I was taught in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and that they only have one more skill like Math or natural sciences.
For me, it was something strange, maybe also because I was Christian and I always thought I was.
How do you do this?
Perhaps you can also tell your work or study colleagues with different accents.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is easy to separate.
There is also a learning plan.
But there is a physicist who does not believe in relativity theory.
What then brings one to believe in religion when one does not believe in it?
What is culture?
The question is not private.
Can it not be changed or not? I can understand English well
That would be very long, then I would quit
It is good, thank you.
I expect a reply by the earliest possible date, possibly at the beginning of next week.
Thanks for your support #NAME#.
Filmsuche Hilfe bitte
Hello love people,
I search for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it is a film for young people.
There are two time periods (or parallel worlds) in the film.
One is the modern world (real world).
The past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite sure).
There is a young woman.
And in the country of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Fluch of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Reich of the Dead who wants to bring the woman into this world to live herself.
The transition is also the grave of the soldier.
At the end, both soldiers are fighting each other.
If you say so, I am grateful for any answer.
Our little one only slept on the couch for a week.
Fast forward: still alive: D
Enjoy yourself.
So a child holds more than you think.
For this reason, be sure that everything is in place, no clutter, more like walking and looking, but not minutes of monitoring.
That makes you wonder!
Fresh air in the room.
Good matratze.
No bed.
Achso and we had no slumbering bag, but always a blanket.
Watch out for your child if it rains.
Does it hurt the head?
Can something be done about the smell?
Or is it with the face directly in the mat?
You can determine whether everything is OK.
We have all grown up, and when my husband died, it was quite sudden and we had to put the kids to bed to go to sleep.
In addition, we are already "old friends" with you and have already bought a lot of articles
But why do you only offer me 20 euros?
Hello, I wrote to you yesterday and so far no reply.
It is about my white glove, which has arrived (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right-wing conspiracy does not fit into the cracks.
I would like to contact you as soon as possible.
The crisis is not yet ready to be used.
To make it quite clear.
RBTV has much to offer.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply that the politics of this channel is now dead in the water.
Fast every format is available (ok), but then at the same time go on a big tour.
It was said that one should be an "independent" Internet sender.
Zitat Arno: Man wolle "keinen laufenden Litfaßsäule sein".
What is man now?
An 0815 advertising channel, which is trying to bring its BilloMerch to the elite.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course for everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
The people should certainly continue to criticize.
One Krogmann is completely lacking empathy and is trying to make Asche pay for the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How should everything be found?
If you like it, I find it exciting.
I request a refund, as my denture was defective.
The #PRS_ORG# corpus has broken through.
Whether as a substitute for bread, or just for snacking – my little warm friend is versatile enough.
Kirschkern- Kissen sind ein traditionelles Hausmittel für wohltuenden Wärmeanwendungen, da Kirschkern Wärme sehr gut aufnehmen und dosieren wieder abgeben können.
The durable interior design can be easily heated in the microwave or in the back of the oven.
The slight difference makes the application particularly interesting, so that the little ones feel themselves, even if it doesn't work out so well for them.
The Kirschkern Kissen with Bezug is only suitable for the following application areas:
Before heating up the kiss, check for unusual odors, spots or stains, and promptly remove if present.
Please take out the interior decorations before heating up!
In the microwell at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (according to the microwell manufacturer!)
The heat is distributed evenly in the quilt thanks to the moisture!
After that, the interior is returned.
With the first warnings, there may be a light frost on the surface, but with repeated applications it will dissipate.
Always stick to the given warning, as longer periods or higher energy consumption can lead to damage (explosion and fire danger!).
Check before a warning of the kissing in the microwell that a heating of skin products in the use permit of the manufacturer is allowed.
After the heated inkwell was returned, please check the temperature of the kiss on your arm for babies (max. 43°C)!
Do not use the knife for serious and chronic, life-threatening or life-threatening diseases, bleeding piles, fresh hematomas, blood transfusions and open wounds as well as for people with reduced sense of pain.
If you have existing high blood pressure, heart disease, venous disease, diabetes or cancer, or if you are pregnant, please consult a doctor before using.
If Nähte opened and lost its core, you should be concerned about the product and the lost core immediately and unconditionally for children.
If the product is used for babies under one year, the temperature of the child should be regularly monitored during the use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product are being reported to the manufacturer and the responsible authority in the country where the incident occurred.
The use is safe and at 30 °C in the machine is harmless.
Please note the safety symbol on the product!
Darmstadt after double - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream of returning to the football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working from the bottom of the table.
There is also no third coach for Ingolstadt.
Jubel in Darmstadt after the late victory in the Spitzenspiel, happiness in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unfortunate debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my network.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought that the network could also be used for business.
Failure, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start despite being plugged in.
So I took the battery out, but nothing happened.
Do you have ideas?
One new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on the internet?
Is that different?
Many thanks for your help!
I want the delivery of #PRS_ORG# to the bedroom.
How can I cut it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But we don't know how high the seats are.....
Often on tour and despite all the equipment?
With the Peak Design Everyday V2 Backpack no problem!
The 20-liter fuel tank also suffers from larger photo equipment without problems, which can be fixed with the polished flex fold parts.
And if you need any additional information during the day, the individual configurable interior space is well organized and easily accessible from the photo editing.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to V2, the series still presents itself in a new look.
The result is a minimalist design - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed a number of highly innovative solutions that secure the interior of the backpack and at the same time allow for quick access to photo editing.
This works with two possibilities: Once conventionally over the deckelclap, which can be locked with the MagLatch closure system, a robust solution for effective protection that already mentions the Messenger Bags.
In the luggage compartment there is a luggage strap with passengers' ankle restraints on the front side of the luggage.
In contrast to most rucksacks, Peak Design has considered various "fill stations" here: there are actually four anchor ballasts, stabilized and which can be locked into place.
If the backpack is full, you just take the top one, it is rather empty.
Claps and knocks are also magnetic.
So the backpack can also be closed securely without the key.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from others, in terms of design: besides the pocket, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of the rucksack with access to the top - you no longer have to feel the content!
At the same time, this clear detail greatly increases the day-to-day practicality of the bag: If you take not only your photo shoot, but also everyday objects or travel gear with you.
In the everyday backpack, you can individually configure the internal space (more below) and thus separate both problems neatly - and by the two recent openings, also independent of it.
In addition, you can also pull out the right side of the backpack from behind the body, for example to focus on the camera on the right side of the front, while the day-to-day things will definitely stay in the left side of the backpack and not get in the way.
This will help relieve the pain.
And because the outer layer of the sack is made entirely from 100% recyclable nylon, the contents themselves will rust if it is going to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I was waiting for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday to confirm the
The arrest of the sender of the false goods has been announced.
So far, I have not received a message.
I ask for immediate intervention.
I am already writing with the third support employee, and in no case did I go further than to protest, which I received a mail as confirmation.
It is the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#
But when could the crisis be resolved?
For me, it is not an option...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
Wünsche Sie noch einen schönen Abend
Hello, my number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was made on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the guarantee, I will immediately make a larger order, but in any case I will keep the damaged furniture and not send it back.
And I couldn't see that last year was any different and that we had not even the time to think about it and talk about it.
But I don't accept the damage as a customer.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered a bright crack in the water on the southern edge of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49 came to an end.
Thousands came from far and wide and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and flowering cities in the country.
Shops were torched, people were beaten, and saloons and hotels opened almost overnight.
Everyone wanted to take their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was: "Coloma or Bankrupt!"
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks a name in the West.
You want to find gold, hire workers, repair horses and build companies.
You will also enjoy the opportunity to discover the surrounding river flows and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You must overtake your pioneer colleagues to not go down with the rest of them.
Coloma is a simple strategy game with many reasons to win.
You have to choose simultaneously your actions, you have to balance your resources and you have to set up a tableau that is more and more for you "working (sic)".
The buildings on your table allow you to be more efficient, to keep additional actions or rules in your pocket.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridges, you can develop your individual style.
Coloma played over a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), from 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California officially became a state).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
While each round will select the players home and at the same time choose a location on the game plan where they can carry out actions.
After that, her selection will be unveiled and she will place her pioneers on the vacant positions.
If a place has the most pioneers, it receives a seal!
This deactivates one half of the position - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players switch actions, for example, gaining resources, moving vehicles, setting traps, searching for streams, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning riflemen.
If all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the price is moved to a new location, and this changes the available options.
This goes on for so long, until the seller has moved five times, so that every location has been covered and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players of Coloma have to defend against a bandit.
If the players have enough revolvers and the bandits pay reasonably, they receive bonuses.
However, if they fail, they will receive reduced wages or end up in the cemetery.
After the third shooting, the game ends.
The player with the most victory points wins!

Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation is now on my Twitter timeline and I have been shocked.
The child psychologist Michael Winterhoff is a favorite guest in talk shows and holds European commitments.
With his book "Why Our Children Are Tyrants" (2008), he launched a major educational debate.
Previous patient: The former patient is now facing serious accusations.
Please pass on, the film is difficult to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
It is never, never, never allowed to use power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child room for his development and the framework for the child as large as possible in the situation, if possible and appropriate.
Brrr, I still shiver.
Holetschek: States call for three-year compulsory test for twins
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a national roadmap for the introduction of the test obligation for three times married couples at their next meeting.
We need clarity as to when and under what circumstances three strikes can be imposed, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, the "Bild am Sonntag".
The switch from 2G to 3G for three mobile phones is "not only medically appropriate, but also offers an additional incentive," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has announced that "he will make a proposal to the Health Minister's Conference next Tuesday." − afp
I also want to return the lamp
How do I do it best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer make a purchase through my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Up, it's a mistake.
You can make a purchase on the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated the data.
What can this be?
What you are describing is *awareness*, that is, insight into consciousness.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
The most common is hearing voices/sounds, the least common is seeing images and the rarest is experiencing pain.
For this topic relevant: Kaiserschnitte are operations that rise with an increased rate of awareness, as you wear a very tight mask to protect the children.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned at the Narkosevorgespräch.
Certain intravenous treatments, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), have a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT**: All the love, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but it had nothing to do with **Nitemarex** per definition.
Have their comments wrong.
But the chair is defective.
The 20 euros are not helping either.
Those are statutory emissions.
The absolute minimum would be that they take the defective chair back.
This is standard in the eCommerce sector as well.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective seat.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose some money.
I already sent you an email that you didn't reply to.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice, the goods will be delivered to my choice of room.
The sender is company #NAME#.
I am calling right now.
He told me that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I must cancel the order, as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture for me in the first place.
Should I not be called?
I had a question
The theatre historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has become a theater critic and a caretaker.
Later, he wrote a monumental theatre history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, fresh: "An old man becomes an old man."
The disturbing diary of a slow departure from the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle has led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the lecture comes the message that the author is dead.
The last sentence in the book is: "I am already showing my gratitude here."
There are various types of palettes.
One of the most common are European pallets, so-called wooden pallets, which are mainly used as protective materials in the European market.
They will be certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was €79 million.
How many pallets are imported to Austria every year will not be raised

Rouladen Tipps & Tricks
I had received many great tips for the perfect Gulasch a week ago.
There were Christmas and it was unforgettable!
Also thank you again:)
Now I have come to the taste and I want to cook the first time to Silvester.

The "drive" of a loud volume adds significantly to the warmth and to the fattening of the guitar sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the valve reactor separation.
With the volume, gain and master volume controls, you can set the desired pitch and balance your sounds.
The Verstärker der VT+ Serie bietet einen einzigartigen POWER LEVEL-Regler, mit dem man den Schallpegel reduziert kann, ohne etwas am "Gain" und der Verzerrung zu ändern zu tun.
Further up, it is already clear that with the POWER LEVEL-Regler, one can even float the performance reserve, if necessary.
Thanks to the power level regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in every situation.
The roof hatch can also be used as an exit.
The following signal is then processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" impression when using a headset or when receiving direct calls.
You can close the aux port with a CD or MP3 player so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
There is also a tuner function on board - you do not need a separate stethoscope.
If you also get a VFS5 fountain pen, you can easily call the sounds with the fountain pen, switch the effect blocks on/off and adjust the tempo of the largely compatible effects.
This is actually unavoidable for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step forward in the future!
But that is not the case with others.
Do you have the possibility to return the lamp?
Why is it so low?
I would also like to send her back.
Can you help me further?
And the fashion?
Will we get another update on the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, are they sitting on the #PRS_ORG#
If it doesn't work, I would be happy with a receipt or voucher.
I find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to have known that sand was part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (Tür) on the planned hinges.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the patience has not been won
Does there exist a premium customer status at Euch?
Iran sees progress in negotiations over nuclear agreement
According to Iranian sources, progress has been made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
Both sides are short of agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda, said Iran's top negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development," because initially unity over the to be negotiated issues has not prevailed.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after almost a week's break.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the talks.
Even a US delegation is in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen overpowers Sachsen - Free State becomes federal state with the highest Corona incidence
Thüringen has defeated Sachsen and is currently the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value of the brand is 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia has registered over 1,000 cases of coronavirus on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day value of 1025 new infections with 100,000 inhabitants.
In Sachsen, which has always been the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the threat in Thuringia was low, but there was also a threat of 1000.
In Thüringen, 2242 new cases of the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths were reported within one day.
On Sunday, 200 people with Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospital.
It could lead to cancellations.
In addition, the health authorities have already been overloaded for weeks and are coming up with new cases hardly any further.
I understand that.
Since the delivery takes place only in early March, it may be possible until then.
I have to put it on the package and deliver it to the post, was it?
Do I have to do anything else?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, so I'm writing to you.
I would like to accept the transmission on my own costs.
The 8 euro tip is in my eyes a fair amount.
It is time for changes
On the Bundestag day, I am greeting you, I am/StratorDE in the plenum in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Where is the post?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, you can see that it is not existent.
We have entered a winter storm and have extended the summer season for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, where is it?
For the most part, this is simply related to dissatisfaction, as some things have been leaked and as we generally stand up here.
In recent days, the impression has grown that many here still have booze on the MBundestag.
What should we change?
At this point, the community is asking about the MBundestag, which they want to keep alive.
The complaint came from u/edizVEVO, which in recent days has become more prominent on this project and has found one, to put it simply, a cheeseburger.
After unanimous agreement, several people from the community have found themselves, who want to rebuild the project.
However, I also want to call on everyone to take part, so that this project can also have a future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which we can come together and work on specific things.
The server can be accessed over this link.
Objectives:
* How should the MBundestag function in the future?
* What orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
* What should we do in the future after leaving the country?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair voting system?
I am pretty sure that I have forgotten something, but it is not bad, because at the end of the day we have the Discord.
If you have time and desire, come to the Discord, work with us and let us democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lamp to be sent to you.
Now I see that the article is too long/clumsy for my taste.
For this reason, I have already requested another postponement.
I noticed it together and then noticed this when I took the weave.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and that I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I still have one question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, is there also in size, that is 240/240, for example?
#PRS_ORG# must guarantee me that the error will be corrected.
And I ask you to leave now.
I have not received a proper packing, but I will be able to remove it as soon as possible - they have to call #PRS_ORG# and see how that can work.
#PRS_ORG# can call me at any time to set up an appointment.
Does it have an instruction for the montage?
How long would it have taken me to worry about this and to decide to end it?
How does she respond to the question of why she is a vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, and now probably rarely eats meat.
I was also a vegetarian a few years ago.
On the question of whether I always want to be vegan and that veganism is a planned step, I replied honestly.
And indeed, I had long thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately also supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become a vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that there was dishonesty on her side, she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and how to reduce as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer was "fluffy"?
How does she respond to the question?
Does the feeling of being a vegan quickly get you thrown in a corner and cause conflicts, without which you would not do it?
There is a harmonious vegetarian woman (;
It is not an exception to Article 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not comply with the legal requirements for remote work.
I am on the eve of the date, on which #PRS_ORG# does not release my returns in person.
Unfortunately, this cannot be changed because I cannot go to the site.
Could you please provide me with an alternative date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I'll be back again.
Lahnsteiner fund for water purification: €45,000 donation from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz approved a subsidy of €45,000 for the new water rescue vehicle of the voluntary fire brigade of Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounts to 135,000 euros.
One good and important investment in security.
I am happy that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us here, says Lahnsteins mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle will be used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
They carry out tasks in water and sewage treatment as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, the boom in the hotelschifffahrt on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increasing use of the lake as a recreational river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I only managed to read 10% of and then pretended the problems didn't exist.
I can't open the book.
However, according to their recommendations, the app has been synchronized, removed and the app has been downloaded again.
I am a little frustrated because I have already spent a lot of time and hope now to help.
Okay, then.
I would like to order three articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG#.
Can I enter a term in the order form?

First of all, thank you for doing this, I have spent almost a decade in the public service in a similar activity, we were also weapons dealers in the execution, I do not want to get involved further!
The question of right and left always seems to me to be very important.
In principle, however, one should say that the state service comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should actually be clear to everyone.
Of course, in addition to the special uniform and weapons, people should also be clear that these people should then naturally be able to deal with the actual reality in a difficult way. Of course, you should also be clear that in addition to the average white people, there are now many Germans with migration background, women and even homosexuals (and therefore I am not going to defend these feminist witch-hunts, because there are far fewer of them than one might think, but rather normal men and women) and these people can and must rely on you.
But these party groups are also represented, even if it first seems comical to my experience after a conservative attitude, they speak proudly of Germany and feel a little more at ease through overdone left-wing politics, even if this policy is supposedly right for them. They just want to be treated normally.
Back to the rights, of course the police and the armed forces are also a part of the society, and extreme rights will be found there, that these are but open their opinion there, or even openly violate any state of emergency plans.
Of course, just like police and soldiers, who were often deployed abroad, because of negative experiences, sometimes things are said that are controversial and politically incorrect.
There is also the risk that certain legal relatives, who have a right to an annuity payment, will also meet.
Nevertheless, my opinion will be well defended and also with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationalized and that is also good for me, because we could not have had right-wingers and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I didn't know that the other Korb had also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it, it was not sold out.
I have already ordered in November.
But it was confirmed in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer deliverable.
I have used #NAME# before.
Alternative, could one still sell the other #PRS_ORG# Korb for #NUMBER# Euro in black in Germany or is this Korb in Germany available somewhere?
I always find only you as a partner company.
But on the top of the hill there are two deep caves, which have been dyed with something

Ordinary by kind?
Hello, me (w32) is already busy with something.
I am very disciplined and organized on the job (I am independent, I do not have a lot of free time), but I have already found it more difficult than it should be to live a clean and orderly life in my house.
There are always phases when everything feels right, and then and then it all goes wrong and I collapse.
But it is not really that "just anyone could visit".
My husband is (fortunately) not better, but I lose almost everything just against work and laziness.
The kitchen is still messy because we like to cook.
Now to my question, has it worked out with children?
We haven't worked on it yet, but this question has been bothering me for a long time.
Because I don't have an appetite, I just don't like it when there's no visitors, and. e. g. always fresh clothes are available and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a greater attraction to children or do you stay clean?
I'm pleased with your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-destructive personality disorder?
I have a degree in software development and have been self-employed for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I am getting more and more tired of the fact that this job is not the right one for me, so I have already been studying again and social work for a long time.
The problem: I have an insecure (or frightening) personality disorder (AVPS).
This means that I do not have self-esteem and therefore I am afraid.
I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but it is very difficult for me to lead discussions and more often than not it has already been said to me that I am unintelligible (whereas I think this is getting better).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a streetworker or in the open youth association, but rather, for example, in the search for advice or in family assistance.
I don't know whether the actual working day really is as I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The AVPS has already led to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it makes me feel like I have to fix something every time there is a problem with my code ("it's just the stupidest things happening again") and it makes it hard for me to ask colleagues for help ("I should now really know what it's like / "I should stop him from making me feel bad" etc.).
I will probably have had problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it.
But have you already stopped?
Because there was no confirmation.
I waited for a release date
Would you please accept it?
If I have read a book on #PRS_ORG#, the author of this book does not authorize me to read this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery for my pain.
The egg yolk (protein) that is absorbed into the egg white (amino acids) in the egg yolk sac is converted into the individual egg white amino acids, and from these, the egg white proteins are built up, which the egg also needs for egg development.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the renewal of feathers in the adult bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with the total organism of the animal with a particularly high reputation.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio cannot be diluted during harvest as it can lead to disruptions in the raw material flow.
After this moderate dose of NEKTON-Bio, NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral powder preparation) should be taken again for daily vitamin supply.

How can a Bürostuhl fall after 9 months?
The performance claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order was damaged and pictures were taken.
Have you received this email?
Statement of a community worker in response to the appointment
Hello r/legaladviceGerman,
I have following problem.
On our plot, a walnut tree is to be grown.
Also complaint to the municipality.
One employee writes to me that the case of obstetrics and thus the birth of a baby is not part of the sentence.
In the sentence, however, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree.
Can I now leave the statement of the employee?
On the one hand, I must leave myself alone to an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the sentence is clear.
I thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging.
I haven't received a message
Naja, then I still have a sofo without use.
Can you offer me a souvenir or a certificate?
What were they?
Yes, I think only the question is whether I pay in euros and let me have the ceiling down to Germany
Can you check it?
Alert: Severe traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St. 2179 between the junction station Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
According to the press alarm of the police (14: 03), a car crashed into the traffic.
There are injured.
Okay, I understand.
Good, then many thanks again for it being so easy!
Rat and ideas to further career life
Happy Christmas to you!
My Christmas is not too bad, because my preferred head is actually doing all the thinking.
Before I come out... shortly: I need advice and the best advice I can get is from people who know my situation - you.
Ich machte das Ref als Quereinsteiger.
Originally, I studied something else and worked there (at least a little bit anonymously, I won't lie to you here).
All in all, however, it was too long and I have considered alternatives that could make me happier.
One day I got a job at the office and I was sure it was - even if the framework conditions were much more flexible than in my previous job, but that was the same to me.
I have now arrived at the third "Google other descriptions".
And it is only half a year away.
I have always decided not to go any further, and at least to end the Ref, then I can still relax.
But I'm completely done.
I had so little free time last month that I completely exhausted myself.
Now it is holidays, but there is still a lot of work that awaits me.
Before the Ref, I always thought I would be stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my party weekend.
I was free.
And the stress on the job was equal at the moment.
Now I am overloading myself with family celebrations.
And then there are these star structures that make me even more nervous.
In principle, it makes sense and, from the outside, the Ref also looks good, which affects the feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely crumbles - if it doesn't already.
I ask myself if I want to live the rest of my life like this - specifically, if I read some of your contributions here - or if I should go back to the old area, where I was appreciated, I could take time off when I needed it, and the work was mundane, but it was well-paying and I worked in a team, not as an individual fighter, as is the case now, for the most part.
But then I ask myself, do I not get to the same place again like now and dissatisfied?
You realize that it's all in the mind, but maybe she had some advice or ideas about how to get out of this situation, which I'm completely done with and almost ready to cry.
I'm not going to make any decisions now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But perhaps my views will help me at least to see some light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, which is already approaching for me.
Thank you for reading and sorry for the poor tone.
I hope that my situation is at least somewhat clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has continued to develop, leading to the combination of progressive modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" division, with which the behavior of a throttle valve is perfectly reproduced.
With the VT20X/ VT40X/ VT100X Amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely at the cutting edge of technology in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amps, the VTX amplifiers are certified with absolute authenticity.
This amp also contains the more common Valvetronix amplifier.
This is partly based on actual analog settings, because these simply better absorb the pitch variations and nuances of a horn amplifier than any simulation.
In addition, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed house and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only whisper.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct historical facts on the virtual stage until the amp and effects sound as if you have already planned it.
The perfect combination of sound and modeling technology is first and foremost the 2001 VOX Valve Reactor technology.
In fact, she was repeatedly fined to take into account new sound requirements, which led to a performance drop in 2010 of the VOX Valvetronix Series - with more dynamism and numerous and improved models.
The new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists can find a maximum sound variety here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamism of a drum machine: they expect a full sound, a nuanced return of spindle dynamics and strings, and a prompt answer.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers have discovered that, above all, the temperature determines the noise character of a loudspeaker and developed the VOX valve reactor technology on the basis of this discovery.
With a 12AX7 reed, the valve reactor counteracts the effect of every VT+ amplifier, so that subtle nuances and the sound character of an amplifier are perfectly balanced.
NBA: Despite 20 points by Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic's defeat series in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it will not be enough against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
In addition, the large main face is adaptable: with three individually adjustable plate and gap shutter parts, it adapts completely to the needs of your photo editing and is therefore suitable for any kind of camera - from simple system cameras to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately passes through the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the object.
One possible compromise would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a burst mode.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still have room for other lenses.
In addition, you can still buy a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (Olympus MFT cameras, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use it for your equipment and for remote things.
Drones pilots also have an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Vulkanabbruch auf La Palma: wohl längst der Geschichte
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the Lavastrom has caused great damage on the Canary Islands.
Is there a end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption in La Palma is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days as the longest on the Atlantic coast of Africa in the west.
There are no reliable data on earlier reports.
The activity of the still-named volcano in Cumbre Vieja has been somewhat reduced in recent days, but volcanologists did not predict when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Damage in millions of dollars
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the more than 1,000-degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a thick lava flow.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents have to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, there were two new landslides with a size of about 50 hectares.
First and foremost, the banana cultivation on the island, which is of immense importance for the inhabitants, was severely affected. About half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants of the island live directly or indirectly from banana cultivation and already found themselves in crisis before the eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were seriously affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and gifts
Christmas is approaching and especially children cannot wait to see the holy festival.
The many bright gifts under the Christmas tree have bound up with the spiritual atmosphere and the chilly tension something mysterious.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still keep our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to remember the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which after the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss became a founding "contract of civilized peoples," which softens the routine and can be filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus got the Christkind
It was the Protestants who had taken to the streets to protest against the Christmas celebrations.
Previously, on the evening of the Nikolaustag, there were rumours about whether or not something was going to happen.
The backdrop for this still popular scene is that the holy Nikolaus, as bishop of Myra, threw gold into the window of three women at night to save them another life in paradise.
From this unconventional way of hoarding, came the popular demand in Germany for snacks, especially for children.
Protestants reject this demand because they see it as a concession to the devil and humanity as a "blessing."
For these reasons, they reject the institution.
Martin Luther made out of Nikolaus the Christ and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of the scandal is on the holy evening.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detail questions that much, it only irritates the fewest, that the need for the holy Nikolaus is as much as the Martins need for Martins and Martins sing-alongs and Martins waltzes still remain part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, in Stiefeln in front of the Türe and under the Christmas tree, one can find everything from luxurious loungers to eagerly awaited luxury cars.
Various traditions in Christian countries
Relics of a tradition of penance date back to the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of the penance is shifted to the holy evening.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a lively discussion about who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christkind am Heiligen Abend appears or the Weihnachtsmann, who in principle is a kind of Nikolaus, has been appointed.
These include, for example, his white suit, which only barely fits with the rather strict Assyrian suit of the historical figure, his slit, which is being rented out and the engineer's request to get access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, the Holy Nikolaus is the central figure at the Christmas festival.
In Spain, the three holy kings give the blessing, while in Italy the henna befana, which has led them to believe that they were the ones who gave birth to Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fairy tales are brought together, while in Russia, the memory of a frosty winter brings warmth.
Here, it is not renting, but three horses that are pulling their saddles.
In Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars, the Christkind is responsible for the transmission of the gifts.

I was told that one of them was shot.
Since I haven't received anything (in the SPAM folder either), I wanted to ask how long this usually takes.
Many thanks.
Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the palace
On Saturday near Kensington Palace in London, a suspicious man was shot by the police.
The police said that callers reported a man with a gun to a bank and a bookstore.
According to the authorities, the man escaped in a vehicle that was later stopped by officials.
There were shots fired and the man was hit.
He was still pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not go from a terrorist background.
In the area around Kensington Palace, several letters have been found.
The palace is the official residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

Pillenproblem
Hello love woman
I hope I do everything right, after a year Reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: About five years ago, I started taking the pill again, mainly because I had such terrible pains during the period and had PMS before the period.
Now I would like to get rid of it as soon as possible, because I have to take a lot of medication that I cannot take.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my hair.
I got 0 to 100 explosionsartig pickles at my last almost two-year break and got them all.
So far so good, but to me it all feels heavy and I don't feel well.
In the two-year break, the whole thing has really not really normalised.
Maybe there's something to avoid this time.
My cosmetics are fragrance-free and without dyes, but maybe there's something I can recommend.
Unfortunately, the obstetrician did not take me seriously and the pediatrician is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, love is such a thing.
If you have a bad case of neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then widespread pimples and acne.

It can also be good that Hormonell is just a whirlwind, but if you want to build all over, you better stop looking for anything else.

I wrote the conversation and now I don't know what was replied to my request.

110 kV cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the transfer of the new high voltage cable to Tann is legally sound.
The Niederbayern government’s decision to cancel the construction plan will free the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
Now the network provider Bayernwerk has announced this.
The approximately seven-kilometer long cable will be the backbone of Tann in the north of the commune and will connect the existing 110-volt system between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected near the Edermanning community in Reut to a mast of freedom of movement.

Ref: Lesson plans (EK)
Hello dear colleagues and colleagues,
Since summer, I have been in remission, and the lessons make me happy, but at the moment I am still planning my lessons in the field of environmental science.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the blackboard, the schoolbook and an OHP as a medium.
In the school, I can also only copy free of charge (which is nerve-wracking).
I just need to plan my hours now.
For example, we are currently discussing the topic of geofactors, and I actually have an hour for myself.
In principle, the methods are always the same, but on the other hand I do not want to invest too much time in simple teaching hours (I also need this for UBs).
I actually always start planning from the learning goal (which is what I want to achieve) and then I look at how I can build it (mostly I create a work sheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am more dissatisfied.
Therefore, the working papers.
Maybe I can work as an expert on the book.
I'm really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
In fact, I have already decided on a new one for #PRS_ORG#, but I would be glad to get back to you as soon as possible.
The trade is threatened because of the 2G regulation.
In most businesses, only those who are sick or ill can work.
The trade considers it unnecessary and complains about price cuts.
He also has a possible solution.
According to the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), the 2G regulations are hindering the important Christmas trade.
In business with articles of non-essential use, he complained, HDE chief executive Stefan Genth criticized.
According to a recent survey of more than 1,100 dealers by the HDE, more than 70 percent of companies viewed the rest of the year negatively.
Many had already written the Christmas business.
What was actually the positive peak of the year, is now often a lake without bottom, said Genth.
As a result, dealers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their business last week.
It is only available in the store and online.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygienic concept is a safe event, said the chief executive.
He emphasized that "2G brings us in the fight against the pandemic not further."
The current regulations are horrifying customers and call for high staffing levels.
He demanded that the ban be extended to the whole country.
After that, each package would only have to be checked twice on 2G (GSM or CDMA) and would have access to all stores that day.
In addition, in individual sales - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (impressed, read or tested) - samples should be checked.
Even the specialist real estate group Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas.
The frequency is currently at around 75 percent of the pre-COVID-19 level, with around 90 percent of businesses operating.
These figures will certainly fall in the important Christmas business," said Wilhelm Wellner, head of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Because of the high number of personnel and administrative staff, the Center is trying to find solutions and authorize them.
This includes the so-called Bändchenlösung, in which "the visitors, for example, once have their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel - can enter all businesses." dpa
I recently ordered the #PRS_ORG# and received it.
The Mirror has a cracker and on the cover is also a mistake that was tried to be cured with a yellow filling.
It looks bad.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it again and wrapped it.
What should I do now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high light output.
For the adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities is used.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperature: daylight and nightlight.
It is also possible to set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K manually.
Use the current settings in the flash storage.
One of the controllers' special features is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The light creates a very bright light with a low light of high quality, completely free of dust.
The glare of 120 degrees, with which you can see large areas at relatively little distance, is amazing.
In addition, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short absences.
They can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on both the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the remote control of the lights in television studios or if the lights are mounted at inaccessible points.
At the back is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery)
Anwenderspeicher The speaker has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To change the settings of the individual settings on the storage plates, simply press and hold one of the storage buttons.
The storage controller saves the current state of the lamp when turning on, so that the well-known situation reappears when switching on again - Very practical when working in the studio, if the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with a battery is one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120. The functionality comes from the possibility of using inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use already existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also be checked before the set to see if the batteries have enough performance - it is a battery tester with built-in - for each of the two battery packs, one value is displayed in the two display screens (the left battery lower display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is also possible to continue to supply the eye with energy through the internet.
The construction of the eye is very simple.
They have a 16mm lens as a starting point, so that you can directly take your photo.
The approval is to be confirmed by notification on both sides.
This has also been noted by the mechanical components, which are extremely robust, and according to this, also on longevity and hard usage.
In addition, a blanket is included in the delivery.
It is also a box in the delivery.
So you can transport the load with all the equipment that you may still want to buy, without problems.
Shame, I have lost and it is too small:(
Party that we wanted to see: Frankfurt celebrates after Torrey comeback against Leverkusen
Was for a spectacular reaction of Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last team to win twice in a row in the Bundesliga apparently was on its way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE hit back, scoring within an hour of a good season start from the Seele and winning 52:2. "It's wonderful what the boys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner jubbled at DAZN and said a "pause-chalice, to each and every one of those who were".
It was initially seen as a renewed challenger for the Frankfurter, who are now ranked ninth.
Patrik Schick had led Leverkusen with 2:0.
What happened then, the SGE coach also noted.
Glasner continued, "how the players came back and showed a fantastic performance."
I am very happy with the performance that we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Defensive player Christopher Lenz, who has been back on the pitch for the fourth time since the fourth round match and his overdone muscle injury, also stressed the morale of his team-mates.
I think our mentality is incredible, said the 27-year-old and was particularly pleased with the result for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to smile today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner now wants to focus on himself, and sees himself as well as the personnel situation.
It is unusual that all players are fit in December, that all players are physically in a top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live professionally.
Now you want to "go one step at a time and keep doing it" and the tasks will "pass this level by" by the end of the year.
Next up, there will be an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) on Wednesday.
I got a grade for my mail because of a mistake on one side.
I have tried to call and leave a message at #PRS_ORG#, but there is no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or must I wait until the money is back and the order is again given?
Unfortunately, I will not be able to order it because it has already been waiting for a long time.
Have they already sat on #PRS_ORG#?
Thieves for handball women in the quarter finals against Spain
Germany's women's handball team shrugged off defeat against Denmark with hanging eyebrows and a vacant look.
At the end of the World Cup, the DHB selection defeated the German team in front of 800 spectators in Granollers at 16:32 (8:13) and now has to run into host Spain in the quarter finals.
We were too enthusiastic and had too much respect for the opponent, said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to face Spain differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the top group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Däninnen (10:0).
It is sad that we could not take part in the flow.
This was a bad game that we have to lose, said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the semi-final, a clear increase is needed against the World Cup second team from 2019 on Tuesday in order to keep the dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The other German player in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Dänemark was Alina Grijseels with six goals.
We were not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," said Xenia Smits, a backstabbing player, and demanded, "We need to look ahead now."
Not from top to bottom
In contrast to the previous five tournaments, the German team was not at the height.
Referees and technical errors in the attack and breaks in the defense were responsible for a rapid 0-4 defeat after seven minutes.
Just Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately on business temperature and prevented with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team at 9: 30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a counterattack.
However, the expected initial launch was not.
In contrast to the aggressive covering of the Dänen, the German women were hardly able to set themselves in sight - and when they did, they mostly avoided the strong Althea Reinhardt in the face of the Scandinavians.
So it was that the team started the match at 3:10 a.m. early, especially because the back-up player Mia Zschocke later on saw red because of a hard foul on her opposite number.
In the quarter finals, however, she may be able to compete again.
Only in the closing phase of the first half was the DHB selection a bit better in the game and until the break at least five goals.
The only hope of a rescue after seven minutes was already at 9: 19.
Again, the Green candidate won in all areas and made it easy for the good opponent, who is in the running for the medal, to win.
As a result, the German team could no longer increase their performance and went as clear losers from the park.
Advent calendar day 6: Family traditions in the Christmas season
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we've moved the Nikolaustag forward and are using it to celebrate family traditions in the lead-up to Christmas, the Advent, Nikolaus, Heiligabend and Christmas.
How was it at home then?
How about your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the best thing for children?
The transfer?
Plätzchenbacken?
Fireworks?
Will it be used?
When the Christmas man comes, the Christkind or is the gift from Oma and Opa?
In the same way, as long as it makes you happy, everyone gives in and around Christmas, it is as easy as possible to have a family.
Whether these now established traditions are, or even every year something different: tell us how it goes in your family or family!
Please provide me with some transaction number. Or otherwise, what could help?

I would like to get a code for free
So as with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Does this apply to them?
There is a title, I am working in mobile intensive care units, in which (so far) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is being administered in hospital rooms.
As soon as these are finished, I will have to go to the doctor's office for a checkup.
I will gladly answer questions about the organisational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, provided they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, and it affects my treatment..").
In my area of responsibility falls the instruction for the treatment, the indication for treatment (if a person claims to have been infected with coronavirus and there is no reason to believe otherwise), the medical documentation and emergency provisions for allergic reactions (I have never seen this happen).
The inspection itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, for example medical specialists.
In Impfteams, on the other hand, we often have no need for them, but "only" (for God's sake, no missing valuation!) pharmacological technical assistants for the infusion preparation, but they cannot infuse (should they?), so that I can infuse most of the infusions myself.
Threatening "hoarder": Amberger knows the solution
What is a "hunter"?
With this dialect word, from an Amberger, a strong thought has been raised in the BR television program "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike many other days, the term in the series "host mi?" was unerrated by the callers.
No, it was not a "nervous man".
And no one needs to "go fast".
That, the people heard from the TV moderator, is completely wrong.
Why the man from Amberg shared the solution and thus probably also saved many Oberpfalzers from despair.
The Huidlerer, the audience exclaims, "is a joke with which someone steals."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been asked by Bayerischer Fernsehen as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the suggestion that this is a typical upper-palatinate term, it is somehow transmitted from the more well-known word "houdern".
When a gap in education closed - probably also among those who have lived in Amberg for a long time.
I can't buy books for two weeks.
There is always the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# with the #PRS_ORG#, connected and repaired it with the PC.
Nothing helped.
Reifenwahl beim Rennrad - wirklich so pannensicher?
Today morning, I woke up full of energy because I wanted to train my motorcycle tour in the coming week at least a little.
Said, done and I drove my racing car, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40 kilometers were also really nice - but then it rained what in every town (this time: Danke Krefeld!)
Glass splitter on the road.
Zack, according to Zischen and my advice, did not want to take part in the rest of the race at all.
Since I had no real chance of worrying about replacement material and replacement air, I had to go back and take the train home.
Then it was not so bad technologically, maybe it is even better if I get used to it again before the ride.
But now I am facing a question and hope that she can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route over several days ahead of me, I would be extremely ungrateful for this problem.
Now, in fact, it's not so bad, because the old owner (a very nice older man, I had the car towed away from me at 1 p.m. on the day 120 km away!) and that this was also already described as suboptimal, because he has been riding with them for years.
But if I think that I still have to change gears when driving to 80-90 kilometers, then I'm really feeling bad: D
Now I have come to talk to an older man, who has surprised me by asking me why I did not do the Marathon Plus run; these should be flat.
Now, of course, the whole thing is very exciting.
But are these really so unbreakable?
I don't have much interest now in paying 40 euros for a ride, only to be disappointed afterwards.
I ask myself again: I feel like I am riding on the racetrack at the moment 25x622.
There are also (apparently?) at the Marathon Plus races, but the majority is already shorter.
Is this a problem?
Or will you pay me for riding a race horse?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute! Laiewissen eher the Durano DD to recommend?
Thank you for the help and love!
Auto crashes against tree: driver killed
The 53-year-old was hit by his car on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for no apparent reason, and then got on the wrong side of the road, police said.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The car of the 53-year-old was then hit by a tree and the man in the car was injured.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to hospital.

After the publication of our new high-end broadcaster B 100- 6 OHM, there was only one question of the time until our SOLO series would also receive follow-ups.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring and reminds optically of the big predecessors with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitable designter foot is directly incorporated to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted to the length accordingly.
Principally, the SOLO 15 is suitable for people who play a subordinate role, but the maximum volume should be achieved at an exceptionally high level.
Just a 10 cm speaker is not able to generate such a large sound pressure.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 is weak.
On the other hand, she is very noticeable and impresses with her size.
Tonal was the SOLO 15 with a slight high pitch.
This is generally the case with broadcasters to optimize the increase in frequency.
Exactly at the Hörplatz, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and very loud sound.
The high-tone area can be reduced, so the soundscape can be warmer.
Thanks to the punctuated cello, the arrangement of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is mesmerizing and breathtaking.
The reference suspected extremely small mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM for a friend dynamism.
The SOLO 15 adds not only to our SOLO series, but extends this in terms of flexibility and accuracy.
As with all our buildings, at the beginning it is recommended to think about the final optical design of the sign, so that appropriate changes can be planned for the construction.
If, for example, the houses are to be furnished, the reduction of the rate of exchange must be adjusted accordingly, as the furnishing adds material again.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the wood market), one should first drill a 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the corresponding place to be able to pass the cable there later on.
With the help of an overhead crane, the opening of the front is now followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be commissioned.
The opening with a 45-degree phase should be avoided as much as possible in order to ensure that the opening area of the speaker chassis in the interior is as large as possible.
The four distortion points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive a break in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
After that, the actual construction of the box begins and one of the two sides is placed on a flat surface in front of you.
Now the return, the dimple, the front and the bottom.
There should also be three restraints in place and bound.
The adjustments themselves can vary depending on whether you want to use finished goods from the wood market instead of making them from 16 mm MDF.
The second side will be brought forward in the next step.
After that, all the plates of the foot, that is, the two sides and the front, follow.
With a passable loaf of bread or a loaf of forest bread, the opening of the bass reflex hole, as well as the connecting rod on the reverse side, is facilitated.
Finally, one uses a roundabout to avoid all the lanes of the actual box.
The upper part of the pedal can also be adjusted.
Afterwards, the footplate will be fixed to the floor with the foot of the house and, in addition, with long wooden strips.
It follows the marks and warnings (2.5 mm hole drills) of the damage caused by vandalism and the connecting screws.
After the wooden structure has been dismantled (disassembled / dismantled), the carriage is started.
This is achieved simply by opening the 35 mm backlight.
In this way, the entire and undamaged cable piece for piece is passed through the 8 mm Bohrung in the foot to the terminal opening and there it stands about 30 cm up.
In the upper part of the building, the cable leads to the opening of the air-conditioning, and there is also a locker there.
Next, the frequency will be prepared and applied.
The Frequenzweiche plan and the corresponding supplementary plan can be obtained from the following document: Montageanleitung Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency divider is installed and the outer terminal is scratched, the 8 mm cable opening in the inner box is opened, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little kick, you can let out the hot chocolate and close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the abdication can be checked accordingly.
Now follows the treatment according to description.
After that, the B 100 - 6 OHM is closed and the corresponding screws are tightened.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus lead (marked cable) has to be pulled (larger contact) towards the plus pole of the speaker (smaller contact).
At the end, the bass reflex is reduced to the length of 28 mm (the total length of the horn) and fixed.
To combat the pest, a mat of the pest control material is spread in two parts and stored in the house.
The opening of the bass reflex channel should be released.
Can I accept an order now and deliver in early June?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will also hold the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio at the moment, which means that a higher planning effort has to be made and the brevity of the announcement is explained.
ABER: There will be at least three people per floor, so that we can follow the Oscars 2021 with at least seven films in the stream and hopefully follow you with thousands!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - so we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will be about 0:30.
You already have cold drinks, plant good food and make yourself ready for a long, but very interesting night.
