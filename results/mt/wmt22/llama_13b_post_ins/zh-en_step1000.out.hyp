Students from Zhejiang University sing the theme song at the annual meeting of the university. Research results make people's minds open - Xinhuanet
Washing hands with air, diagnosing diseases by breath, and precisely searching for the source of dust. At the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year of Zhejiang University last night, a series of outstanding academic achievements were honored.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students. The research covers a wide range of fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science and humanities education. The students started from a curious point and created many high-end inventions with application value. Some projects have won awards at home and abroad.
Biological sensor: Your family doctor
Zhang Di Ming, a Ph.D. student of the School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a smart mobile phone sensor on the spot, which is only half the size of a smart phone.
You only need to breathe gently, and this instrument can detect the initial health condition from the gas components in your breath. "
Zhang Di Ming introduced that this set of sensors is connected with smart phones. After the gas is released, the health report will show on the mobile phone.
Intelligent bracelets that can detect health conditions on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensors uses graphene, a new type of material, as its target. Its sensitive "taste" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the health status of the body.
Smart surgical lamp: Doctors' high-powered eyes
In addition to smart phones, smart surgical lamps have also been used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver medal at the 44th International Invention Exhibition of Geneva this year.
Zhu Linjing, a master's student in the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, and Shen Junfei's team opened up a new idea in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented an intelligent LED surgical lamp.
“Many diseases are not diagnosed and treated in time, which is related to the lamps used in the operating room by doctors. "
Shen Junfei said that if doctors cannot see all tumor tissues in time during the early diagnosis of cancer, the cancer cells will still spread.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lampshades. By adjusting the light spectrum, it enhances the contrast of different tissues under light.
During the surgery, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and contrast according to the needs of the surgery and the patient's habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Shao Yifu Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College and Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash hands with air: save water and be cool
Ordinary people usually wash their hands by splashing water and rubbing soaps, most of which are not sanitary enough, while Li Keqiang and his fellows invented an "air hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the washing machine, our weight can compress the air.
It's like a pressure cooker.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the water head and combines with water.
In this way, we can wash our hands cleanly! "
Color reaction and bacterial residual experiment prove: The effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of the ordinary washing method.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure the degree of cleanliness and save 90% of the water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention stood out from many top universities in the world and won the only gold medal.

A meaningful certificate - emergency certificate
This is one of the important skills certificates in addition to the driver's license!
Popularization: In fact, emergency measures are emergency rescue when emergencies occur, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, in the process of rescue after the accident, in fact, there is still a period of time, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time to rescue.
If I really have a heart attack, brain bleeding and sudden breathing, our life window is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, people around know how important the rescue is!
When someone falls down in front of us, we can rescue him through professional knowledge, instead of foolishly standing there and doing nothing, which is too helpless to make people feel terrible.
In China, our official data show that there are 3 million deaths from accidents every year, the most dangerous of which is sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the average is 15%.
In the casino hotel in Las Vegas, 78% can be saved. Shanghai and Beijing are below 1%."
This is the first response from the initiator of the first response, Lu Keqiang.
If someone has a heart attack and is not breathing and does not have a pulse, there is nothing you can do.
It is necessary to do manual ventilation and chest compression to save the person.
I found that nowadays, not many people will have such awareness to learn emergency rescue, but when the incident happens, they are not ready, so I am still calling on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.
It is uncertain whether it can save a person's life!
You can enroll in the local Red Cross training center. I enrolled in the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. Students also have preferential treatment.
PS: The last picture is the goal I wanted to achieve when I was 25 years old. Adding the emergency certificate to the goal list is also a few months ago, but it is really completed!
Next, I went to apply for other certificates I wanted to get, such as a diving certificate. I saw an advertisement for a diving certificate in the little red book, and it turned out that I had to take an exam to get the certificate, so the emergency certificate is still very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#

To sum up, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a grand film from all aspects.
But if you say this film is not a highlight, it is not at least a good choice.
There are all kinds of blockbusters, so that you can easily fall asleep in the cinema, and so that you will feel indignant after watching it. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Everest for the audience. It can set off your anger in countless ways.
Insulting the audience in this way, Han Han is really a gift from heaven.
The most painful thing about this film is that it is a copy of the character in the novel. It is difficult to name, and the loopholes are like the wind on little Marco's body.
Even after watching it, you will doubt whether there is a hidden implication of the director, but when you carefully think about it, it is actually a pile of shit.
To put it simply, I have difficulty understanding some things.
The main residence of the man should be on a small island in the south, and he should live with his grandmother.
Her grandmother wanted to see snow, so the plot arranged for an old neighbor to take her to northeastern China to see snow.
The elderly sat on the bus from the south to the north to see snow?
He and his father are very relaxed about it.
Then the old man didn't know what to say.
How did the female boss get the business license when she opened a hotel on a discarded boat?
Why can the small plane party on the island easily close a mountain road?
Then the truck carrying steel bars in the middle of the road stopped at the roadside. The truck driver could not be found around the truck.
This feeling is too obvious.
Why would an unqualified and illegal little drone party become a police auxiliary?
Faced with the fact that high-yield loans are not reported, the police in the film also asked if there were any difficulties?
A grown-up knows how to use a smart phone, but does not know how to use a hotel card to open the door of the hotel room, and then forcibly arranges to find the hotel boss and sleeps outside the room?
This bizarre incident is full of the whole film. Because the incident is too far-fetched, I will feel painful when I recall them.
In addition to the scene, the worst thing is the film's purpose, or rather, the film has no purpose at all, it is a face-saving monster.
At the beginning of the film, you think he wants to shoot a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you guess it may be an inspirational film. When you watch it for half an hour, you think it may be a film to show the difficulty of a young person's life in a small town. When it ends, you don't know what you've actually watched, and then comes the doubt about yourself. Why did I run to the cinema to enjoy the convenience?
For most people, in fact, it is very familiar with the route of all kinds of films. For example, if you want to shoot a taxi driver, you have to encourage yourself + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented bird is how to walk to success.
If you want to shoot a love story, you have to tell the truth about the grudge between the young people in the small town and the waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, you can't have things in your story that contradict the real world.
For example, Yin Zheng's new character was just burned, and then he could still sing the song. It is impossible to open my brain and see if I can't hold it.
As for the female lead, who is not very smart and can only act like a five-year-old in some aspects, I really don't know whether this is the result of acting or the director's requirements.
There is also something I don't quite understand. Why is Han Han, as a race car driver, so eager to add car crash scenes in his own movie?
Is it possible that such a film arrangement is for the audience?

Inspection of the production and processing equipment of the concrete module of the shaft Zhengzhou shaft brick module equipment introduction:
Zhengzhou Yi Xin is a professional manufacturer of concrete inspection shaft equipment, inspection shaft machinery, and tunnel wall segment machinery. From semi-automatic to fully automatic production lines.
Through years of practice and development, it has now developed into a series of quality products, including hydraulic, mobile, and automatic inspection drilling equipment, as well as supporting facilities.
Inspection of the production and processing equipment of the concrete module of the shaft Zhengzhou shaft brick module equipment assembly scene:
Inspection of the production and processing equipment of the concreting module of the shaft:
Yi Xin checked the applicability of the equipment for new types of construction materials such as coal, heat, water, electricity and gas in municipal and underground construction.
For example, all kinds of inspection wells, rainwater mouths, shafts, cesspools, small buildings, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantages of using prefabricated concrete modules to build inspection wells are that the four corners of the module are all concave grooves, and the combination of brick masonry forms a chain lock.
The shear resistance of the masonry is far superior to that of the brick masonry.
The module is a hollow structure. After the combination of bricks, it is longitudinally and transversely connected to the hollow, and the hollow is filled with concrete to form a network structure, which plays a secondary reinforcement and waterproof role.
The longitudinal and transverse grooves are set in the module, and the longitudinal and transverse grooves increase the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells made of concrete by the construction module of the concrete inspection wells are not easy to collapse, sink, and other phenomena such as water leakage. The mechanical performance of the well wall module is stable, the operation is simple, and the shape standard is met.
The intelligent control equipment data input and output device of the concrete inspection shaft machinery equipment is a touch screen liquid crystal display monitoring machine that realizes the ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of samples, density rotation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the shaft wall module adopts single-cylinder hydraulic pressure and transmission, double-cylinder hydraulic pressure and transmission.
The independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the impact of the host vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The formwork of the concrete inspection shaft module was lifted from the mould, the storage bin door was closed, and the automatic conveyor belt was used. All of these were completed independently by the hydraulic system to reduce the damage and maintenance of the machine.
The concrete inspection shaft machinery equipment adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, sealing members and hydraulic components, and the comprehensive performance of the sealing equipment is reliable.
The excitation platform of the tunnel wall module machine adopts a whole plate of steel, the cutting surface of the table is not welded, and the filler box is free to move and guide, which fully reduces the mechanical damage.
The molding pressure is reduced, the filler is combined with the compaction, and the whole process is integrated and synchronized. The mold is vibrated and the mold is vibrated to ensure the vibration effect.
The vibrating mechanism of the vibrating wall module machine is mechanically excited, and the amplitude of vibration is automatically controlled by the computer according to the material price ratio. There is no impact grinding, thus extending the service life and reducing the cost.
The mechanized control and manual control of the tunnel wall module have dual functions.

Chongqing Central Vocational School pilots modern apprenticeship system - Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, the city will pilot the "modern student system" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools, and the students participating in the pilot training will have the status of students at the same time, and will be recruited as unit employees after being enrolled in the pilot enterprise.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the admission of regular secondary schools and the employment of enterprises be standardized, and the dual identity of the students of regular secondary schools and the qualified employees of enterprises be clarified. According to the principle of two-way selection, the students, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement. For students under the age of 18 who have not reached the age of 18, a quadripartite agreement must be signed by the students, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching contents and rights protection of the students in the apprenticeship and training.
It is encouraged to pilot schools to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and cooperate with enterprises to jointly carry out pre-employment training and transfer training for employees.
The pilot school should reform the mode of talent training.
The school and enterprises jointly design the talent training plan, and jointly formulate the professional teaching standards, course standards, position standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot adopts the cultivation system as the pilot period. The internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training plan. The top-level internship is generally 6 months.
In practice, enterprises should implement the model of enterprise-class management. According to the characteristics of different majors, one teacher can take 2 to 5 students as disciples to form a learning group to ensure that students master the skills required for each training post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has divided into three batches to confirm the trial of 60 city-level secondary modern students. The number of students in each batch is about 50, with a total of about 3,000 students.
According to the principle of first trial and then promotion, and from point to face, we will explore the long-term mechanism of establishing school-enterprise joint enrollment, joint training, and unified sports, so as to effectively improve the skills of students, and improve the employment rate and quality of students.

South African doctors: Ebola is contagious, but most cases are mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms of the new coronavirus Omicron variant are milder than those of the Diamond variant, although the transmission speed is faster.
According to the Associated Press, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Gauteng Province said in a medical organization report that the symptoms of the coronavirus patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the common cold.
The organization's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none have required hospitalization.
Pelley said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days. "
He said that this includes the elderly and those with health problems, who are more likely to fall into severe illness due to coronavirus infection.
He said that compared with the previous Delta outbreak, the new coronavirus patients he treated "have difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days. "
Two weeks after the first report of the emergence of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctors' observation and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases: Among the new coronavirus patients hospitalized in the past few weeks, only 30% were seriously ill, which is half the proportion of severe cases in the first wave of the outbreak; the average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among the new coronavirus patients in the past few weeks, only 3% died, while the death rate among the cases in South Africa in the early outbreak was 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, quoted data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports as saying, "At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a warm disease. "
He also said: "It is still early now, we need to get the later data.
Usually, the time from hospitalization to death is later, and we have only been in this outbreak for two weeks. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of the current vaccine and treatment methods.
Although Delta is still the most important new coronavirus strain in the world, cases of Omikron are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases discovered in the first week of December in Gauteng Province increased by 400%, and tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were caused by the Omikron variant.

Educational evaluation: What should we rely on to rescue abducted children?
If it is compared with the famous public welfare advertising slogan "Without buying and selling, there is no killing", then in the good environment without the need for "extortion", the group defense and the whole people's anti-extortion, so that the theft behavior is useless, risky and costly, such crimes will not be repeated.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency information platform for missing children developed by the bureau.
This is an authoritative channel for the release of missing children's information and an Internet information platform for the timely recovery of abducted children.
When I heard the name of the App, "Tuan Yuan", I felt very warm.
The new technology is not only named "literature and art", but also full of emotion. It is also information-based and practical and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement is to find the children who have been abducted and to protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list many "big words".
However, before the case of human trafficking is cracked, the personal safety of the victims should be given top priority.
Some topics, such as "whether all child traffickers should be sentenced to death", can be temporarily shelved and discussed cautiously; but topics such as "rescuing trafficked children" cannot.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, human traffickers are inclined to leave the scene of the crime as soon as possible after getting the money.
The longer the child is away from the parents, the more difficult it is to solve the case.
In this case, it is a practical action to come up with a platform like "Tuan Yuan" to help solve the case and find the missing children.
After all, "stealing" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
To combat crime, protect the rights and interests of children and parents, and from the improvement of legislation to the protection of the judiciary and the strict law enforcement, it is necessary to carry out the care of "protecting the young and supporting the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can also be done better from the family to the society.
For example, a common case is that a family of three took a nap at the railway station and woke up to find that their child was missing.
We cannot expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, we should at least have a certain level of protection awareness.
Parents taking turns to have a rest and placing the child under a stable protection are the most effective ways to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police crackdown on the crime of trafficking in children, the purchase of children by one side should also be concerned and punished.
A single illegal act is often just a link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for trafficking in children is five years' imprisonment; if the circumstances are particularly serious, it may be sentenced to death and confiscation of property.
Given the general trend of "leniency", the crime of trafficking in children is obviously a crime that deserves severe punishment.
Even today, there are still many cases of theft.
It can be seen that some people's concept of parental leave is backward, and their legal awareness is weak.
The legal education of these people should be synchronized.
In order to effectively control the crime of human trafficking, it is not enough to rely on the strict law enforcement of the authorities.
If the theft of the "market" is widespread, the thieves are eager to make money, constantly innovate the means of theft, and form a "fighting" situation with law enforcement. The theft action will inevitably fall into the low-efficiency quack.
Therefore, in addition to eliminating the backward concept and the common sense of the law, it will also help to eradicate the crime of buying and selling children.
Yang Gaodong presents the spirit of the 19th Sixth National Congress and the Provincial Party Congress
Draw strength from the party's century of struggle
Hunan Daily, December 10 (reporter Gong Biwei) According to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, on the morning of December 10, Yang Gaodong, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of the Publicity Department of the Provincial Party Committee, made an interactive speech on the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China at the video and literature garden of Maoshan. He thoroughly studied and implemented the spirit of the 19th National Congress, studied and implemented the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech on Hunan, and studied and implemented the spirit of the 12th Party Congress.
Yang Gaodong, from the three aspects of ideal belief and initial mission, self-revolution and youth party, party leaders and party theory, combined with his own self-awareness and personal experience, explained the core spirit of the meeting and the practical requirements in depth and systematically.
He pointed out that we should combine the spirit of the entire meeting with the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech on Hunan, combine the spirit of the provincial party committee with the provincial party committee, integrate with the study, strengthen the ideological consciousness, political consciousness and action consciousness of defending the "two establishments" and achieving "two maintenance", and unswervingly move forward in the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
At the interactive exchange session, the representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprises and young people asked about the relationship between the three historical decisions, how to understand the decisive significance of the "two establishments", how cultural enterprises can grasp the orientation, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the hundred years of party history. Yang Gaodong answered the questions in plain language and with vivid examples. He encouraged young party members to draw strength from the party's hundred years of struggle, to unite closely around the party central committee, to follow the party unswervingly, and to dedicate themselves to the party with their youth.

The International Olive Oil Council divides olive oil into two categories, virgin olive oil and refined olive oil, and five grades.
Cold-pressed olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is obtained by mechanically cold-pressing the fresh olive fruit, and then removing impurities through filtration.
According to the different acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Extra Virgin): It is the highest grade and the highest quality olive oil, and it is a pure natural product.
The taste is perfect, with a mellow plant flavor and acidity of less than 1%.
High-quality extra virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): The acidity is slightly higher, but does not exceed 2%, and the taste is pure and fragrant.
Ordinary virgin olive oil (Ordinary Virgin): The taste and aroma are still good, and the acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil with an acidity of less than 3.3%, which is obtained after the first pressing of olives, or it can be called "second oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Ordinary olive oil (Olive Oil): A mixture of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of virgin olive oil is blended to adjust the flavor and color. Its acidity is less than 1.5%, and it is a transparent golden yellow.
Refined olive-pomace oil or olive-fruit residual oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): It is obtained by extracting and refining olive oil from the residue of olive oil.
If you have seen the classification, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
It is important to know that olives are like grapes used to make wine. Olives from different production areas and different olive varieties will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow olive oil:
The coastal areas along the East China Sea have the most suitable soil and climate conditions, such as temperature, sunshine, humidity and rainfall, for the growth of olive trees.
In addition to the coastal areas of the mainland and the sea, other areas can only be planted in suitable areas.
Main production areas (land and sea):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Albania, Egypt, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, and many other countries with similar climates are also in the southern hemisphere, such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa.
The harvest month of olive oil:
From May to June every year, the olive tree blooms and bears fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and ripen, turning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
The period from November to the next February is the real harvest season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
The nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, and alpha-linolenic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the oils discovered so far.
After the closing ceremony of the Democratic Peak, Biden said that the fire of freedom would never be extinguished
The online "Summit for Democracy" (Summit of Democracy), which was attended by the governments of 110 countries around the world and the leaders of civil society and the private sector, was concluded by US President George W. Bush on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the heart of every person in the world, and the authoritarian regime can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Tang Feng, a representative of the Taiwanese government and a member of the Mainland Affairs Council, and Hong Kong democracy activist Ronny Tong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know that the work in front of us is so difficult.
But we also know that we can embrace the challenges, because, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere.
The authoritarian regime will never be able to extinguish the flame of freedom. It burns in the hearts of people all over the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the whole society.
He said: "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the bulwark of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent complaint governance, and more effectively resist the slow and violent forces of monopoly and the people who want to pursue power in the name of public interests. "
The themes of the second day of the "Democratic Peak" are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with the "International Human Rights Day".
In his opening speech on the same day, UN Secretary-General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially the challenges brought about by new digital technologies.
He said: "It is time to reiterate the common values and positions and the democratic determination.
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving inequalities, fighting corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires the resolute criticism of all forms of nationalism, localism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Hong Kong democracy activist Ronny Tong delivered a pre-recorded speech at the summit, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and ethnic minorities such as the Uygur and Tibetan people in China.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been under the rise of China, but there is no mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must cooperate.
It is our primary task to use all that we have (resources) to ensure the restoration of democracy. "
Luo Jiancong also called on the free world to unite to counter the threat of the Communist Party.
He said, "Maybe some of you are afraid of angering General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, or maybe some of you don't know about the threat the Party poses to our democratic values.
And this is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason we must change. "
Tang Feng, a member of the Mainland Affairs Council of the Executive Yuan of Taiwan, attended the round-table discussion on "Striking down digital authoritarianism and affirming the value of democracy" and released the "National Declaration" through video, emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and oppression.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the COVID-19 outbreak through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "On the occasion of Taiwan's democratization, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global anti-authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, the authorities of all local governments took the public health and collective interests as the name, rationalized the violations of human rights, and the global democracy showed the signs of recession.
However, in Taiwan, we do not have to seal the city to control the epidemic, and we do not have to shut down to defeat fake news. "
At the same time as the "Democratic Peak Conference" held on the second day of the schedule, the US Treasury announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea and other countries that were found to have violated human rights. At the same time, it imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in violating human rights.

Hello, the water chicken sent by the restaurant is alive
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid that I can't stick to it, so I want to find a slightly cheaper coach first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often inversely proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, the valuable normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap shot, which is actually industrial waste.
Their strength is very low. When the ball hits the top of the hoop, it vibrates a lot, the hard ball can't be stopped, and the high hand is very difficult to drive.
Their logic and subtext is that tennis is so hard, you know you won't learn, and you also know you won't stump up the cash, so they fob you off with a cheap racket and some balls, you have a couple of lessons and then you give up, it's so cheap and you don't get hurt.
You can really tell the difference between good and bad, which shows that you have made progress. When the time comes, I will come here to buy the valuable, and I will earn twice the money.
It is recommended to spend the same amount of money to buy a second-hand good basketball. Choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough. Therefore, even if you have a good basketball, you can't sell it for a good price. A new one of 500 or 600 yuan is enough. A second-hand one of 200 yuan, do you really want to enjoy it?
He is very friendly to newcomers, but once they are past the newcomer stage, he will ignore them. Most people, especially girls, are not past the newcomer stage.

In fact, there is a lot to say about the dressing of a girl with a slender body.
Girls with fat bodies should not wear dresses that are too short or too long. The length should just reach the knees. Otherwise, it would not fit the fat thighs.
If the skirt is too short, the fat legs will be exposed.
If it is too long, it will give people a sense of being short and fat.
If you take off the top and divide it into three sections, you will naturally look taller. You can use different colors for the top, skirt, and long pants, which will make you look taller.
In fact, many dark-colored dresses are the best matches for chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this point), dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat, and the black short skirt with a high waist is also the favorite of chubby girls.
Put on a dark suit, especially a black skirt, will make you look slimmer.
If your legs are fat, your socks and shoes shouldn't be too noticeable.
The more Vietnamese, the better. The color should not be too bright.
So that people do not pay attention to your legs and feet, making them feel fat.
For a slightly chubby girl, it is necessary to talk about how to wear clothes and match accessories.
Thin girls should not wear tight dresses. Otherwise, the upper garment should not be too short or tight, which will make people uncomfortable. If your legs are thick, you can wear black long trousers or grid trousers (the kind with fine lines), choose a soft and delicate printed chiffon dress, and pair it with a decent top. This can effectively hide the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, the micro-thin girl is also a matter of concern when she wears a short skirt.
Fat girls wearing short skirts should choose tops that match the color of the short skirts. This will make you look slimmer.
Wearing a short skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the most IN pairing in summer!
If you are fat, but your legs are very thin, you are recommended to choose a beautiful skirt.
Not only can it cover your belly, but also show your advantage.
A-line dresses will make people look taller and slimmer. They are more suitable for chubby girls. Choose a tight-fitting upper garment to create a sense of hierarchy.
A simple white T-shirt with a short skirt is also a good choice.
Chubby girls can also wear fashionable clothes.
As long as you can master the rules of wearing clothes, even the chubby girls will be the focus of attention.
In terms of clothing and accessories, there have been changes. In life, it is also necessary to do more sports and strive to get rid of the label of a fat girl as soon as possible 😄

Girl shoots an arrow for her sister: "It's okay if the meat is hurt" - Xinhuanet
In Hangzhou Wulin Square, a little girl stood in front of a big wooden board, on which there were words, "Human Flesh, 10 Yuan, 1 Arrow".
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl Jing Dandan as a volunteer to raise funds" went viral in the circle of friends.
The photo shows that a girl stands in front of a wooden board which is a little bit higher than her at Hangzhou Wulin Square. The words "Human Flesh Target, 10 Yuan 1 Arrow" are written on the board, suggesting that people can shoot the arrow after paying.
The action triggered heated debate among netizens.
Last night, the person in charge of the publicity department of the down-town branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl was the niece who made such an exaggerated move, but such behavior was not worthy of advocacy. After being admonished, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl on the street was advised to stop collecting donations
In the photo circulated on the web, a girl with long hair stands in front of a wooden board and writes down her bank account number and WeChat and Alipay accounts with a brush on the board in black ink. The words on the board read, "Human flesh search engine, 10 yuan per shot".
The picture caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens said that such behavior was "shameless", and many netizens agreed.
We found the situation at about 10 a.m. on the 23rd when we made a tour around the square. Many people had gathered by that time.
When interviewed by local media at the scene of the incident, the police of Tianhe Police Substation said that there were two girls on the stage and they were about 20 years old. They were dressed up beautifully.
Among them, the girl who played the "meat hook" was crying and asked the passerby to play the game. Another girl stood by her side and helped her to drink, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and now urgently needed an operation, please help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was soliciting donations for her sister's treatment of leukemia.
Last night, the person in charge of the publicity department of the down-town branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Jia Lili and she is the niece of Jia Yanyan.
However, due to the treatment costs of more than 300,000 yuan, he did not think of a good way to solicit donations and made such a move.
He said that during the whole process, the two girls took turns to be the shooter and the other one to support her, but they were not involved in the process. During the whole process, no one was found to shoot arrows, but someone only took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After the police were identified by the public security department, it was found that the bow and arrow used did not belong to the controlled scope.
The person in charge said, "It does not advocate the method of soliciting donations in this way."
After being warned by the police at the consulate, she has left the consulate.

What is the hottest thing in 2021?
Undoubtedly, it is the Tokyo Olympic Games.
Do you think only Olympic champions can win?
Previously, an article titled "Quick Look! The Olympic Project Manager Who Can Impact the Gold Medal" was very popular. It mentioned that in many projects, the project managers are absolutely the first ones to run to the site, work overtime, and stay late. They are heroes who save the day, heroes who put out fires, and heroes who apologize.
It seems to be a funny article, but it also reflects the daily grind of the project managers, representing the lack of enthusiasm for the current project management work.
And people who do project management work are gradually choosing to get rid of the dilemma of work through some actions.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (Project Management Professional) applicants every year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management capabilities.
According to the "Report on the Development of Project Management in China for 20 Years (1999-2019)": By the end of September 2019, the accumulated number of people taking the PMP® examination in China was nearly 600,000, and the number of people passing the PMP® examination was about 420,000, while the number of people holding a valid certificate was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® certificates in the world.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMP certification holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers are aware that they can no longer rely on the old experience to do things. The ever-changing work environment reminds us that we need to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can the PMP certification ensure the smooth progress of project management work?
Many project management beginners said that through the study of PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major areas and five major processes of project management, but when they really do project management work, they are still in a fog.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: the cognition of project management is not in place, relying on personal experience, there is no project management theory, do not know how to practice; there is a lack of systematic support for the project management process, it is impossible to land in the work, the project estimate is not right, the sensitivity of control is different, and the project is dragged down; the membership is not clear, and the "old oil" in the team does not know how to deal with it. Cross-departmental assistance and communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to promote...
Therefore, the focus on product innovation and R&D management has helped many excellent enterprises train a large number of product managers, project managers and other R&D key talents, and has won the honorary title of "China's Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and other honorary titles. The online course of "Research and Development Project Management Special Training Course" brought by Tianhe Xiaozhong Consulting with the honorary title of "China's Talent Training Demonstration Base for Enterprise R&D Management" and other honorary titles.
Online Course "Special Training for R&D Project Managers" This is an online course in the form of fragments, combining the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises, to help you master the essential knowledge and standard actions required by project managers, and embark on the path of continuous improvement in project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less investment to promote the training process of project managers and bring high-efficiency operation results.
Without evidence, let's first see how other students evaluate this course: This course is not only taught by the expert team of Zhongtianhuaxia (the former R&D management team of Huawei), but also based on the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises, so that the course content can be thoroughly and superficially explained from a professional point of view.
It will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich templates, and help students apply what they have learned to their specific work after the course.

Jiaotong "Double Twelfth" advocates rational consumption to consumers before the festival - Economic Observer
This year's "Double Eleventh" festival online payment transaction volume reached 177 billion yuan, a new high compared with previous years.
The abundant variety of full-price red packets and the live broadcast of shopping tours have attracted consumers once again. On the one hand, the consumption boom makes people sigh that the national consumer power is becoming stronger and stronger. On the other hand, we must calmly think about the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer groups of today.
On the eve of the "Double Twelfth", Jiaotong Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiaotong") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the broad masses of users, especially young people, to set up a good consumption consciousness and consumption habits, and to refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
On the whole, the performance of China's residents in financial consumption is good, but there are large differences in financial behavior and skills, and there is still a need to further improve the basic financial knowledge level.
The financial literacy of the elderly and young people is relatively low. "One old and one young" will still be the focus of attention of financial education. The "Report on the Debt Situation of Chinese Young People" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV-2 show that young people have great consumption potential. Credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products. Nearly half of them do not have accumulated debt. Although young people as a whole reflect a rational consumption trend, they are far from the "exaggerated fluctuations" labelled by the outside world. However, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-the-wind consumption behavior, which has led to excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even social problems. Financial institutions should take social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jiaotong has always been committed to providing quality and heartfelt services to help the common people build their own happy life. It advocates consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responds to the call of supervision to improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially the young.
In the past few years, Jiaotong has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and has guided the rational consumption needs of young people in various forms such as innovative practice competitions through cooperation with domestic top universities, so as to help them establish a rational consumption concept, reasonably plan their consumption needs, and accumulate life-long financial wealth.
When the Double Twelfth arrives, Jiaotong reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and correct money view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumer loans, and avoid affecting personal credit and future economic life.
When shopping, one must plan ahead and pay promptly.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on the purchase of cars and housing in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose legitimate institutions and channels, and pay attention to whether the relevant agencies have business qualifications.
In the future, Jiaotong will, as always, leverage its mature and reliable consumer finance system and continuously update its financial products to bring more personalized and diversified services to consumers, and continue to help the public raise their financial literacy and help consumers develop the concepts of responsible consumption and moderate borrowing, so that Jiaotong can be a reliable financial partner for consumers.

Vietnamese People's Newspaper - ASEAN responds to common challenges
The stopover of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman includes Amman, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain and Côte d'Ivoire.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit of Mohammed bin Salman to Kazakhstan since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in the middle of 2017, which led to a maritime diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive ban on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
The tense situation in diplomacy has seriously affected the internal unity of the ASEAN and has had a negative impact on the economy of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have closed the land and air routes to Kartal.
This crisis was resolved at the January 2021 APEC summit. All APEC members signed a joint statement with the United States and Canada on "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in trying to restore relations with Cairo and Riyadh through the appointment of new ambassadors to Cairo.
The Arab countries of the Gulf resolved their differences to restore relations with Qatar based on the requirement that they must unite in the face of common challenges for the sake of the interests of their countries and regional stability.
During King Salman's visit to Amman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between two neighboring countries on the coast.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel and integration of the supply chain for the citizens of the two countries.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Amman, and the companies of the two countries have signed 13 cooperation memoranda worth $30 billion.
Saudi King Salman's visit to the countries around the sea coincides with the Iranian nuclear agreement, named the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which is an agreement for the rescue of Iran's nuclear program that has been blamed by the countries around the Persian Gulf for being unable to solve the Iranian missile issue.
The countries around the Persian Gulf have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor", and regard Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
All countries in the Gulf believe that if the Iranian missile issue is not resolved and no action is taken to contain Iran's activities in the region, there are shortcomings.
In the context of the failure of the nuclear talks between major countries and Iran to meet the expectations of the countries around the sea, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct talks.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the slow growth of national economy in the APEC.
The upcoming APEC summit will be the first summit of APEC member countries since the dispute between some members and China ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the contribution of diplomatic achievements to promote the resumption of the unified role of the Gulf Cooperation Council in order to fully cooperate with its member states to address common challenges and make contributions to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Good
It is said that the cheering sound of the new mountain district is the largest!
This car we brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor of Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
It costs nearly 2 million yuan, and the annual road tax is less than 10,000 yuan. Why is it called the LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
The editor doesn't know either. According to the data, it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. That is to say, the editor's Myvi only needs to reach 30km/h before others reach 100km/h. Yes.
The low-slung body, the scissor doors, the huge inlets around the body and the glass-smooth 6.5 V12 engine under the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
There is no need to say too much about the description of the car. You can Google it yourself. The editor has summarized some explanations that Google may not give!
Too eye-catching, wherever you go, everyone is looking, very uncomfortable! (It's actually quite cool.)
1km oil money is about RM1 (The driver doesn't care at all)
The posture of getting on and off the bus needs to be practiced, otherwise it will be a little embarrassing (because you will not be able to get out of the bus cabin and sit down).
The sound of the engine is too loud, and my ears are ringing after getting off the car (but it's still cool).
The car is too large. If it is parked in a normal parking space, it will be too narrow. It is afraid to be closed by the opening door of the next car!
A bit lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (the little editor himself said, irrelevant to the driver, haha)
Don't be fooled, this video is not for sale, sorry!
If you want to shoot a video of your beloved car, welcome to contact us!

A car accident worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are known to car lovers. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, while the price of Porsche 911 is also in the million-dollar range!
A few days ago, overseas just crashed the 911 and Chiron in just a few minutes!
As a result, it is reasonable!
Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of academic ideas and value pursuits formed in the long-term development of a university. It is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of universities has been of great importance to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, as well as the progress of a nation.
Since its birth as the first modern university in the world, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from that of other social organizations. For Chinese universities, it has arisen in the autumn of national difficulties, and its spirit is even more influenced by the traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocates the value concept of "building a well-off society in an all-round way" and the patriotic responsibility of "rejuvenating the country through education."
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious. The global competition in education, science and technology, and talent is increasingly intensifying. As an important "supply side", the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and World-Class Disciplines" has put forward higher requirements for the development of colleges and universities.
How to strive to enter the ranks of the world's top universities in a short period of time and accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having a certain gap, so as to realize the "bend the supercar"?
In addition to the determination of goal confidence, path confidence, and ability confidence, colleges and universities should also give full play to their three advantages: the first is the advantage of late development, through the continuous introduction of outstanding academic talents at home and abroad, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, and achieving a significant improvement in academic level and learning quality; the second is the advantage of cultural confidence, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, and gathering strength, shaping the brand, and improving the image; the third is the advantage of institutional confidence, giving full play to the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthening goal-driven, building a consensus, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for the school to accelerate beyond the world's advanced level.
In particular, it should be noted that the construction of a world-class university cannot be done in one fell swoop, and while each school must play to its advantages, it must also highlight its individuality and characteristics.
The characteristics of the school should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique goals, traditions and resources of the school.
For Zhejiang University, we pay special attention to three aspects in running the university: First, we pay special attention to the training of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated educational environment for the combination of science, education and enterprises, and form a whole-chain educational system of entrepreneurship; Second, we pay special attention to the cross-disciplinary meeting, promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, and create an institutional environment for the cross-disciplinary; Third, we pay special attention to the characteristics of the running of the university and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a large-scale scientific research cooperation system in Zhejiang.
In this process, it is particularly important to adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the "seeking innovation" course, the "study, virtue, enlightenment, and perseverance" shared values, and the "River and Lake, Qiang Zhenyu De, Opening up the Way, and Planting My Country" shared system are the latest expression of the Zhejiang spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of study and constantly accumulate cultural height and condense spiritual energy. It is rich in connotation and far-reaching in meaning.
Among them, "Hainan River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the chestnut of "using the talents of the world for me", and reflects the high-quality concept of learning from the world's famous colleges and universities; "Qi Zhengyu De" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, which means that universities should not only pursue truth, but also be more in line with the perseverance and personality of the pursuit of truth; "Opening the way for the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes not only the pursuit of knowledge and scientific innovation, but also reflects the reform and development, and the old and new changes. "Planting my country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always keep pace with the national destiny.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of study.
The wise hear the unspoken, and the sage sees the unformed."
Chinese colleges and universities should further establish the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, have a deep understanding of the historical mission of the cause of higher education, and accelerate the construction of becoming a world-class university.
At the same time, we must uphold humanistic care and independence, so that the spirit of the university resonates with the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation, and thus provides an irresistible impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

Iranian President: If the sanctions on Iran are lifted, the Iranian nuclear talks are expected to reach an agreement - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, December 11 (Reporter Gao Wencheng, Wang Shoubao) Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in Tehran on the 11th that if the United States lifts sanctions on Iran, a "good agreement" can be reached on the comprehensive agreement on Iran's nuclear issues.

When NFT was launched, the crypto community came up with a new concept again.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia. Some residents who lost their jobs because of the epidemic began to obtain stable income from the game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based virtual pet game that combines a variety of NFT play modes. It is currently the NFT project with the highest trading volume, with more than US$3 billion in transactions.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeded US$8.2 million, surpassing "Wangzhe Rongyao".
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially claimed that its daily active users have exceeded 1 million.
The hot Axie Infinity will introduce a new "palytoearn" model to more people, through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players will no longer be a single character. In addition to the fun and economic benefits obtained from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game maker, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is the choice of enterprises on the track, that is, the choice of investment grade industries. First of all, we should choose a large industry with a market size of more than 100 billion yuan; secondly, we should choose an industry with good future growth; finally, we should choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and the flatness or steepness of the track refers to the competitive situation of the industry.
Go for it!
In the new year, the first thing is to sum up the 2021 adjustment of the 2022 military deployment.
The art of war lies in "doing things right," that is, doing things correctly.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," that is, to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find the direction, and the art is to land. There is a space for strategic thinking in most martial arts thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (strategic thinking) can be thought of as whether to continue to deepen the current field or extend to other fields (strategic thinking); for example, how to increase the retention rate of customers (tactical thinking) can be thought of as how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on the increase of the participation rate of activities (tactical thinking), it can be considered how to set the correct activity KPIs and achieve the correct activity goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and precise retention; on the increase of DAU (tactical thinking), it can be considered whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin ushered in several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small country of Salvador in Central America declared Bitcoin as a legal currency, marking the first time for Bitcoin to become a legal currency in any country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years, and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), marking the first Bitcoin-based ETF compliant with US securities regulations to be listed on the US capital markets, signaling a further expansion of investment opportunities for cryptocurrencies.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork called "Taproot" to improve the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduce the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of blocks.

It is very important to take pictures of wedding dresses. Fortunately, I met a photographer and a make-up artist who are both beautiful.
After seeing my wedding photos, I found that I was also "photographed".
A group of overseas Chinese filed a complaint against Yale University, Princeton University and Harvard University for discrimination against Chinese students - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting the admission process of three prestigious universities, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College, which allegedly discriminated against Asian-American applicants.
The Asian American Education Association, which initiated the lawsuit, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yuzhong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian American applicants meeting the admission requirements of American colleges and universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asian Americans in these three American colleges and universities has basically remained the same.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities have "systematically and continuously discriminated against Asian-American applicants" in the so-called "holistic admissions process."
Zhao Yuzhong introduced that the study of scholars such as Sander in 2014 showed that among the three universities, the number of Asian applicants was the lowest in all ethnic groups.
Data from the US Department of Education also show that among all the schools in the Ivy League, Brown University and the Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate of Asian students, while Yale University and Brown University have practiced racial quotas against Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yuzhong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice would be able to conduct an investigation and take measures to stop these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans after determining the facts.
They also hope that the college can take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change the admission policy for Asian Americans.
At present, the three colleges and universities that have been sued have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Association was established in 2015, when it filed a complaint of discrimination against Harvard University, but the US Department of Education did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese American group, the complaint was also filed by Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American and Pakistani American education groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Luo learned about a factory building in Yuyang Town, Zhejiang Province, from the house. After many on-site visits, Mr. Luo decided to buy the factory building.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu bought the details of the purchase of the factory building and the family of Mr. Lin, the owner of the house, after consultation. On the same day, he transferred 200,000 yuan through the bank to set up a deposit.
Lin signed as the payer on the "Factory Building Sale and Purchase Agreement", which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy this factory building, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory building, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agreed to sign a purchase and sale contract for the factory building within one week."
However, after that, the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the sale of the factory building and the payment method, which led to the delay in the signing of the housing purchase contract.
Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
It's not easy to see the house in the middle, and the deposit has been paid. The mortgage is also ready. I just signed the contract and the seller didn't sell. This made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the People's Court of Yuyang City.
The court held after the trial that the parties failed to sign the formal contract ultimately, which should not be blamed on the defendant alone, and the negotiation was unsuccessful, so the defendant should not be held responsible for the double payment of the penalty, and the penalty should not be applied.
After the first trial, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the Second Appeals Court upheld the original verdict.
【Lawyer reminder】 In the trading process, it is necessary to be cautious to the greatest extent.
At the time of signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to be cautious and attentive to the meaning of due diligence, such as verifying the information of the property owner and whether the property is occupied by others, and clarifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract in order to prevent disputes between the parties when the contract is performed.
（German Voice Chinese Network） After the "Democratic Peak" ended on Friday, the spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leaders' Democracy Summit", which was "outlined in the form of consciousness, the democratization of democracy and the weaponization of democracy, the hypocrisy of democracy and the actual opposition to democracy, and the transfer of domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States will impose its political system and value concept on people, implement the 'democratic transformation', indulge in unilateral sanctions, and plan the 'color revolution', causing disastrous consequences.
“Democracy” has become the “biggest lethal weapon” the US has used to interfere in other countries.
This summit is a fulfillment of Biden's campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held via videoconference and was attended by leaders of 111 countries around the world, including the leaders of Taiwan, but not the leaders of China and Russia.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States on the issue of American democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to hold such a summit.
There are also doubts about the summit internationally and in the United States, for example, about the invitation of some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, some of whom questioned whether the government of Guatemala was truly interested in democracy or in organizing the summit for geopolitical purposes.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also participated in the video democracy summit
The statement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday said that "the American-style democratic disease is manifest today. Money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social division, racial contradictions, income polarization and other issues are becoming more and more serious." The American democracy is based on the "rich man's play" on the capital base.
In his speech, U.S. President Donald Trump said, "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the bulwark of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, and more effectively resist the slow and violent forces of authoritarianism, as well as those who want to blindly pursue power ahead of the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not self-evident, "We must continue to update it in every generation, in my view, this is our decisive challenge in this era. "
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "face continuous and worrying challenges, and democracy needs defenders to defend it."
The United States promised to launch a one-year campaign after the summit, including a US$424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that all countries will make specific public commitments before the physical democracy summit scheduled for the end of 2022 to improve their democratic systems.
Ban said, "Let all countries implement our commitments and report the progress we have made next year."

What is the law of drinking red wine?
Everyone's hobbies are different. Some people like to collect, some people like to eat, and of course there are people who like to drink alcohol. Red Label Whiskey is currently one of the best-selling Scottish whiskeys in all countries, and Red Label Whiskey has also won the gold medal at the International Wine and Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of red wine has a unique flavor, but if you don't know how to taste it, you'll miss its aroma.
So, how does the red wine taste like?
Here is a simple introduction for you.
How to drink red wine:
Sonnet 43 is a blend of about 35 single malt whiskies from Scotland. It has a rich fruity aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scottish single malt whisky. It has a sweet and smoky aroma.
The nose is filled with aromas of grass and strong smoke.
The wine can be drunk directly or mixed with your favorite beverage.
Red Bull entered the domestic market, and in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, Red Bull mixed with cola, soda or new energy drinks has become a long-lasting trend.
These sweet drinks, in addition to the sour taste, can bring people pleasure visually, and join the drink to change the taste of soda.
The most authentic and traditional way to drink it is with a slice of lemon and a cube of sugar (white sugar can also be used).
The authentic flavor of red wine is somewhat acidic, adding sugar can balance its acidity, the lemon will bring a refreshing aroma to the wine, of course, the sweetness can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best ways to drink red wine. Everyone can try them as a reference. I hope that my introduction can help you.
Educational thought: How does the college entrance examination make "study masters" and "study slaves" get what they deserve - Xinhuanet
Three Lanzhou University students wrote a letter to the school leaders, reflecting the confusion of the college entrance examination, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the examination, change the examination topic, and make the examination really reflect the actual level of the students.
Indeed, for a long time, the college entrance examination has been a "hot topic".
In the university campus, the students come from all over the world, and their abilities are different. In addition, their learning stages are different. It is difficult for them to learn from each other.
For a group with so many characteristics, there are different feelings in the assessment, which is inevitable.
Of course, if the question type is single and the repetition rate is high, the topic is too simple, it will inevitably cause another kind of sharply different feeling.
Students who do not work hard may be able to pass the exam by focusing on it. If they want to try other methods, they may achieve twice the effect.
As a result, "study snobs" who did not put in much effort could still pass or even get a good score, while "study tyrants" who never skipped class and worked hard on their assignments and notes had no "strange phenomenon" on the exam.
In this way, it seems that the students of Lanzhou University reflect the problems that exist in the college entrance examination. It is believed that this situation is not limited to Lanzhou University.
From this level of meaning, we should praise these three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, people who have been to college all know that it is common to prepare for the college entrance examination, try various ways to "deceive" the topics from the teachers, strive to expand the scope of the college entrance examination, and seek "intensive coaching" before the examination. Even in the examination, it is not surprising that some people bring small notebooks and ask teachers to raise their hands after the examination.
In the author's opinion, as a quality assessment orientation, it measures the competence of a college entrance examination, more than the teachers' overall grasp of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific theme based on this foundation.
When entering the undergraduate stage, majors begin to subdivide. Many major courses are based on basic knowledge.
It goes without saying that whether one has a comprehensive understanding of the basic knowledge of a subject is what the college entrance examination tests.
The basic knowledge of the undergraduate is the basic theory and common sense of the subject. From the point of view of knowledge, the change in space is not great, and it is basically fixed.
As the teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics learned in college 20 years ago is still important now."
However, the basic knowledge points are basically unchanged, and do not represent a single examination topic or repeated test questions.
In many colleges and universities, the examination is generally composed of topic groups, and then the examination paper is prepared by the subject senior teachers. The examination paper is also read by all the teachers who are responsible for the subject. In this way, the problem of repeated questions in the examination can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, in order to design a set of tests that are in line with the actual situation of teaching and learning, the topics should be in line with the overall learning situation of the students, and the difficulty should be distributed in a positive manner. In addition, it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and analyze the degree of learning of the students, so as to make the examination topics difficult and dynamic, so as to highlight the basic knowledge examination, and at the same time, to consider the ability examination. At the same time, it is necessary to innovate the design of the topics.
The examination is the baton of university education. What kind of examination, the students will have corresponding preparation schemes. In the past, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the students' suggestions, Lanzhou University attaches great importance to it and has implemented the rectification plan in the whole school.
It requires all educational units to organize teachers to carry out seminars and final examinations, and to formulate the topics of the examination papers and the relevant systems. At the same time, it strengthens the supervision and inspection of the topics of the examination papers and the examination and approval links, refines the grading, and strengthens the comprehensive inspection of all the links of the course teaching.
From the mechanism point of view, it is necessary to solve the problem of single question type and repeated questions in the college entrance examination. Of course, it is necessary to introduce the corresponding system, but the hard work is in the daily, we need teachers to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only need to understand the content of the teaching, but also need to understand the learning situation of the students. Two heads are better than one, and the teaching and learning will fit better, so the examination will be more in line with reality, so that "study masters" and "study slaves" can get what they want.

Photography of wedding dress (Nanjing store) has not yet opened a branch
Because we did not have enough time, we changed the time twice. The consultant, Lian Lian, helped us arrange the time patiently.
He later chose a good weekend to shoot.
The staff of the queen's work, whether it is a consultant, a make-up artist or a photographer, are all praised.
That was the first time I had my make-up done professionally. I couldn't believe it. One day, I'll also look that good, haha.
Xiao Qian and another sister (I'm sorry, I forgot her name) were very patient with the makeup. The makeup was also very natural.
The scene was filmed in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was very good that day. I didn't feel very cold. When we were taking photos, the make-up artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes, headgear, and help us fix them if something went wrong.
The photographer was also very humorous. He felt very happy to take photos the whole day.
When choosing photos, because I saw a lot of cases on the Internet, I didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we chose photos, we really didn't mind adding more photos. We put 24 photos directly into the album without deleting any of them. (I heard that the sister of the bride, who took photos of the wedding dress, had more than 7,000 photos. I was shocked and afraid that I would choose too many.)
Today, the photos are all done, and Lan Lan sent them to me. I looked at two and thought they weren't very good. They immediately helped me retake them.
I compared my sister's photos taken before with mine, and I felt satisfied with my photos. They were simple and clean, just the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend that everyone go to Xuanhan to take wedding photos for women!
Set price: 3999 yuan

3,200 newborn babies in Saudi Arabia were not issued birth certificates due to a special anti-counterfeit paper
YAOUNDE, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- The National Registration Bureau of Sao Tome and Principe said that due to the use of special anti-counterfeit paper for storage, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns since the beginning of October, affecting a total of 3,200 people.
However, the director of the bureau, Karina Amoros, assured that all the babies who have been applied to receive the newspaper have been recorded in the system, and the certificates will be mailed next week.
At the press conference, he responded to the report of a net media on the alleged printing problem of the newspaper for up to 10 months.
He said that the problem had appeared two months ago, and that Salvai also faced the same problem.
One of the reasons is that the production of special anti-counterfeit paper in China has been affected by the epidemic, leading to a delay in the arrival of the country.
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used by the Shaanxi Daily is different from that used by other regions, so it cannot use the inventory of other states.
Kaur Amirnus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper has been delivered to Kuala Lumpur on June 6, and was handed over to the printing company on June 8 for partial printing.
The Bureau will send people to collect the goods in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday, and the final stage of printing will be done immediately after they return to Saba. It is estimated that the visa will be delivered to the applicant's hand within 2 working days (December 20).
We will notify the applicant to go to the local branch to receive the newspaper. "
He added that Saudi Arabia has issued 24,801 newspapers so far this year.

The keyboard feels good to type on, and a mouse and a converter are also included in the package, which is more cost-effective than that of other brands. Generally speaking, it is a good deal for its cheap price. It is advisable to use it for a while before evaluating its performance.
This screen is really amazing!
It is very smooth and easy to use. I will comment on it after a while.
Education information: Beijing's special admission ratio for primary and secondary schools in early 2016 - Xinhuanet
On the 21st and 22nd, the examination work of Beijing's primary and secondary school special classes was uniformly organized by the district education committees.
This year, all districts of Beijing have compressed the proportion of special children, and the competition for special children is more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, the proportion of the number of primary and secondary school special class students admitted this year is generally less than 5% of the total number of students admitted in the district, and the planned admission number is 380 people, which is less than 10% of the school admission plan.
All students with sports, art and science and technology specialties and who register online are eligible to take part in the specialty student recruitment examination.
In order to facilitate the students to take part in the examination near their schools, Dongcheng District continued the arrangement of last year's examination, and set up 1-2 examination locations in each school district, totally 13 examination locations.
The examination points are divided into examination rooms according to the examination areas. The time is divided into hours. The students who take the examination on the same day will enter the examination room according to the time period.
On May 23, the district education enrollment examination center announced the list of students who passed the examination on the Internet. Students can check the examination results on the Internet.
Can it be delivered in 10 to 15 minutes?

The key is that I didn't eat dinner tonight

Xinhua News Agency, Sarajevo, December 11th. The chairman of the BOCOG, Cai Weiqi, said recently that Bosnia and Herzegovina is very much looking forward to Beijing Winter Olympics and firmly believes that China has the ability to host the Winter Olympics successfully.
A few days ago, China's ambassador to Barbados, Ji Ping, met with the chairman of the Barbados Olympic Committee, Cave.
During the meeting, Kweisi praised the relations between Pakistan and China and said that he was impressed by China's outstanding organization work when he visited China in 2008 during the Beijing Olympic Games. He believed that China has the ability to host the Winter Olympic Games during the special period. The people of Botswana are very much looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympic Games. The Botswana Olympic Committee is actively organizing participation. Botswana hopes to take this opportunity to carry out more extensive exchanges and cooperation with China in the field of sports.
Qi Ping said that China and Brazil have a special "Olympic link".
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics was successfully held here. Two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open the curtain and present a simple, safe and wonderful party to the world.
It is expected that the two countries will deepen exchanges and cooperation in the preparation and training of winter sports and athletes, and the Chinese Embassy in Barbados is willing to continue to play a role as a bridge to promote the continuous deepening of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries, so that the two peoples can "move forward together," and wish the athletes from Barbados good luck in Beijing.

Strengthen the prevention and control of port city epidemic situation within 48 hours and set up a "buffer zone" - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporters Dong Ruifeng and Guan Tiancheng) The State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the outbreak of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus in port cities, requiring people who have recently left the port cities near the land border (excluding port cities connected to Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a 48-hour negative test certificate for nucleic acid testing, and people arriving at the port city near the land border to undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date of determining the port city range and announcing in each province, district and city to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that under certain conditions, port cities may study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within the jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and the two-way flow of border residents is frequent.
By implementing the differentiated management policy, the prevention and control of cross-border spillover has become a two-pronged approach, which is expected to achieve the displacement of the epidemic, compress the risk of cross-border spillover, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and lowest social cost.
Recently, many local concentrated epidemic situations have occurred in China, all of which are imported from overseas.
The above notice pointed out that some local epidemic situation monitoring and early warning are not timely, high-risk personnel closed-loop management is not implemented, routine acid inspection is formalistic, cold chain items are not destroyed in place, centralized isolated places are not standardized, epidemic emergency treatment is not scientific and precise, etc.
The notice requires that efforts be made in 9 aspects such as improving the epidemic situation prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic situation monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the rectification of shortcomings in the prevention and control of epidemic diseases in port cities, make every effort to do a good job in epidemic prevention and control work, and weave a tight external defensive line.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should study and deploy epidemic prevention and public health security work synchronously, publish and open the hotline for public health security, regularly check the hidden dangers in the basic livelihood supplies and prices, and solve the outstanding problems reflected by the masses in a timely manner and take the initiative to respond.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, states, leagues), and directly administered cities where the ports are open, and the specific scope will be determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, directly administered cities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

Oil pipeline video reveals the truth of 20 years of bloodshed by the US military - Xinhuanet
（Video source: Oil and Gas）
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the Oil Platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching a war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism," forcibly exporting American-style democracy, and 20 years of poorly-armed, blood-thirsty, and ruthless soldiers committing all kinds of crimes against humanity.
Abusing unmanned aerial vehicles to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian facilities, distorting human nature, and establishing a killing group.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghans.
The US military set up a "black prison" to impose various cruel punishments and humiliation on "criminals".
A series of anti-human rights violations has aroused more anger among Afghans.
As the video said, the American "anti-terrorism" war is "more and more terrorism".
The war did not bring peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only brought a full-blown country and countless killing and destruction.
The video exposes the true face of the United States with "anti-terrorism" as a name, the bloodthirsty killing, and the fake democracy of the United States!
Accidentally, I saw the following article. From the commercial point of view and the perspective of saving time, why does the customer want the logistics company in the free trade zone to do packaging, although packaging belongs to deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of the logistics company, the following text may explain why the customer wants to do so.
I have visited many dairy factories and contacted many dairy production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of the packaged and hearing aids are the same, without any difference.
So everyone will ask: Why is the warranty period of bag packing one year, while the warranty period of hearing aid is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price of the hearing aid and the bag so different?
In fact, many consumers or moms think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same as the valuable ones.
Some consumers also said that the taste after eating was different from the taste they had imagined!
Now, let me tell you the reason why the equipment is so expensive. Where is the value?
Why is the price of the original material so different?
Because most of the time, when the factory sets the price, it considers that if the packaged price is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept. This means that the profits earned by the factory are low or even zero. So how does the factory survive?
Therefore, they have a large increase in price to ensure their profit space.
Therefore, most of the factory owners are pushing the hearing aid, but not the bag.
In addition, the advertising fees of so many factories every year are tens of millions or even billions. Where do these fees come from?
Everyone knows.
With the development of society, the promotion cost of the market, such as the promotional staff of the shopping mall, the display cost of the shopping mall, the gift cost of the product, the advertising cost and so on, are also increasing.
Therefore, all manufacturers are constantly increasing new products, and they are hearing aids. Their prices are also increasing. In fact, this is a new product that has emerged with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost of their raw materials will not increase by more than 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, do not choose means, and hang doctors of hospitals to help promote their products. From 30 yuan to 80 yuan, the profits are different.
China's relevant laws are absolutely not allowed to operate in this way. In fact, this practice is harmful to consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy packaged milk powder and put it in a jar at home. This can save costs and increase the shelf life and airtightness of the milk powder. It has no effect on small children.
In addition, don't think that the warranty period of hearing aids is longer than that of bag packs. If the warranty period of hearing aids is the same as that of bag packs after opening, it only means that bag packs are not easy to preserve after opening and are easy to be affected by quality.
The food was cold because the delivery was late. It was cold and hard. There was no way to eat it.
And the soup also came out

Don't push people over the starting line - Xinhuanet
Going to the book market, you can often feel the fire of successful academic books.
Today's successful self-help books are full of "best principles" - that is, assuming or implying that you can "do it," and then telling you what you need to do.
That is to say, it has passed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
For this reason, these books all have a common feature - either do your best or don't do it at all; either you get 100 or 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you do nothing and wait at home.
This "best principle" will be recognized as "absolutely correct" by all, but 99% of the people will be trapped in the starting line.
Because this kind of theory advocates a path of "you must be determined to remake yourself and make a 180-degree change," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who cling to the past and refuse to change, you must loudly shout "you must change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly self-deception and a show of force.
Most people will reveal their impatience in front of the words "transformation", and can't wait to make a decision. Or they are determined to make a change based on the excitement of the moment, and courageously take the first step, but more often than not, the good start doesn't last, and they can't continue to persist.
Mr. Ma's famous "From Tomorrow" is a classic performance of this "universal humanity."
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's capabilities, making most people "sigh and hope."
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way for more people to embark on a relatively successful path.
The core of the "second-best principle" is the "reduction of thresholds" - it advocates a "small victory for a big victory" theory, that is, if you don't do 100, as long as you do 1, it's okay: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you don't climb the mountain, it's okay to climb the small slope in front of your house, because it's stronger than the original step.
In short, as long as you do something, you will be stronger than if you do nothing.
Since the threshold has been greatly reduced, it has become more likely for ordinary people to adhere to it, and the probability of success will increase as long as they adhere to it.
However, the road to success in following the principle of "putting others first" is a bit longer.
In general, the "best principle" although it has the flag of making everyone successful, but it is ultimately able to inspire a minority; while the "second best principle" can effectively inspire more people, and try to make more people benefit.

Qinghai Lake shrimp resources increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results showed that the amount of Qinghai Lake salmon resources this year increased by 71,000 tons from the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons. Compared with the initial protection in 2002, the cumulative growth has increased by more than 40 times.
The Qinghai Lake hairy crab, a well-known specialty of Qinghai Lake, is a precious fish species in Qinghai Lake. It plays a significant role in maintaining the ecological security and biological diversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of lake trout in Qinghai Lake was sharply reduced due to factors such as a large number of fishing and farming in aquaculture waters. In 2002, the amount of lake trout resources in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake scallop was listed as an endangered species in the "Red List of Chinese Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of the lake for fish farming, prohibiting any unit, group or individual from catching salmon in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and its tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of salmon and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial breeding and release, as well as the design of scientifically reasonable "fish bypass channels" in the main rivers and lakes of Qinghai Lake, the protection force has been continuously increased, and the amount of Qinghai Lake salmon resources has gradually increased.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, introduced that up to now, Qinghai Lake salmon have been artificially bred and released for nearly 180 million. The contribution rate of Qinghai Lake salmon resources has exceeded 23%.
The source area of the Yangtze River in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source area in China and even in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the eastward expansion of the western desert.
In order to protect the ecological environment and wild animals in the source areas of the Three Rivers and the Qinghai Lake watershed, and to maintain the diversity of wildlife on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued key watershed fishing bans on the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, and has built a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me a bag. I had to put it in the bag. The weather was cold.
Do you want to ask a question? Is the export in a bag?
We only see a bag
I want to know if it is leaked or someone stole it, thanks.
It's been an hour, but it hasn't been sent yet
I just saw a fake article and it was too long.
Tell the unknown man.
Most girls will have their first period between the ages of 13 and 15, and will be closed at about 50 years old.
After that, it will come more regularly every month as long as your body is healthy.
However, it is not regulated to be able to make precise predictions. It is about a week in advance. It needs to be prepared in advance. Sometimes, the weather will also change suddenly (about a few days in advance).
The duration, blood volume, and pain intensity vary from person to person. Some people have it for three days, some for a week; some people have less blood, some people have a lot; some people have no reaction, some people hurt so much that they have to be taken to the ambulance, and the pain changes over time. Pain-free does not mean no pain for a lifetime.
The moon is uncontrollable, and the bleeding lasts for 24 hours from beginning to end. The only thing to do is to use a sanitary towel or a sanitary towel to suck blood to prevent it from flowing onto the chair.
The pain is mainly due to the secretion of progesterone. At the beginning of the physiological period, it is not in time to eat broccoli to effectively alleviate the pain of the month. After the onset of pain, eating nothing is useless.
During the physiological period, because the uterus is full of blood and the release of progesterone is too much, it is easy to pull the stomach.
If it is about the period, it is quite mysterious. Basically, it will come in about two days.
It is best to change the towel for two to three hours. Otherwise, it is easy to breed bacteria. In addition to the sleep time, the worst situation is to change it six times a day. There are 42 pieces a month. If you add the pre-prepared share, there may be 50 pieces. It is not used every month.
The sanitary towel does not have to be changed frequently. It can be changed once every five to six hours. At most, it can be changed for eight hours.
The menstrual period may be more violent during the menstrual period. The ovulation period will also be unstable due to the change of hormones in the body, which will make people feel dizzy and unstable.
However, the official crime rate data can see that the ability of women to control their emotions is still high and will not use emotional problems as an excuse.
The flow is not only blood, but also includes detached endometrium.
The endometrium of the uterus is the thickest just after menstruation, and then gradually becomes thinner. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. Every month, the house (endometrium) is prepared to welcome guests. If the guests do not come, the whole thing is dismantled (menstruation) and a new house is built next month.
The moon is very inconvenient. For several decades, for several days a month, it flows blood for 24 hours. Who wants to?
However, people can be born because their mothers have gone through the confinement. The confinement is for you to live in a house for 10 months before you come to this world for the first time. We should all thank our mothers for having a healthy confinement.
In the past, many things that women did were suppressed. The society told women that they were dirty, shameful, and everyone thought that was how it was, but times have changed.
If someone thinks that the moon is cruel, and thinks that the female body is cruel as a preparation for pregnancy, it should not be said out loud in front of the general public. The girls stand up, don't think about it, you've never experienced it, and you won't experience it in this lifetime, and you don't know those men, so don't be so ungrateful, how can you be so ungrateful to your mother, how can you want your children to be so ungrateful?
Finally, the sisters tried the sanitary towel, and it was really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival, and the mistake is more disappointing.
I want to order a meal for my little friends.
It is hoped that all products in the store will be checked.
Is it possible that the foot bath is leaking electricity?
Choosing a suitable foot bath basin can play a good role in foot care. Today, Guomei editors will answer this question and hope to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath basins have become more popular among consumers. A variety of products have been launched onto the market, from more than RMB 100 to over RMB 1,000. This has given consumers a great deal of choice.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with the traditional home appliances, the sales of hygiene-related home appliances such as bath basins have skyrocketed, but bath basins do not have a special industry standard, so there is a certain safety hazard.
It's too dangerous to have an electric heater in the bathroom!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a bath basin as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt a prickly foot when soaking his feet.
Mr. Li thought it was the vibration function of the bath tub that caused it at first, but he did not expect that after shutting off the vibration function, his father still felt the foot massage.
Mr. Li tried writing with the pen and was shocked to find that there was electricity in the bath water.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad. Although he withdrew the bath basin, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable.
Because he found that the already widespread bath basin is now set at the highest temperature, applicable to which population and which material to ensure harmless, there is no clear and detailed industry regulations.
However, in general, the bath basin is not likely to have electrical problems, but it is not ruled out that a small number of products do not have strict control when they are produced.
Therefore, when buying, choose a divided bath basin.
The separation of water and electricity has no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can take a convenient pen to measure.
The opening ceremony of the 13th Provincial Tea Expo - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Net - Huazhong Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (reporters Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoming, photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and the promotion meeting of new red tea was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center. The tea industry, innovative tea technology, the promotion of tea culture and the acceleration of the goal of the tea industry with an output value of 100 billion yuan were displayed.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the Board of Directors of the All-China Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and Ye Hongzhen, deputy director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a keynote speech at the opening ceremony: the source of lake red is new, and the rise of red tea has injected new momentum into the "five-color Xiang tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of a 100 billion yuan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "three Xiang, four water and five colors tea".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and the main tea categories such as green tea, black tea, and red tea have been promoted. The main tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism, and the tea farmers have increased their income.
The wind turbine is rotating and the red tea is brewing.
Tea industry experts in the province said that after the harvest of green tea, red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income in four seasons of the year, and the output value of tea gardens increases directly.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders presented certificates to the enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark for the fourth batch, and Xiang Hui welcomed the "Hunan Red Tea".
At the new tea exhibition hall, Fujian tea merchants saw a high mountain tea called "Bingli Spring" and immediately ordered it.
Wang Zhenggao, secretary general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said that at present, the epidemic situation and other factors have a greater or lesser impact on the tea leaf market, but from the scene of the tea exposition, the situation is bright.
The new red tea has a strong red color, injects the connotation of tea culture, and has a strong popularity and trading enthusiasm. The Xiang tea industry welcomes the new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?

The basic principle of philosophy is to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation "Formerly, I studied" is taken from the "Sutra of Formerly, I studied"Sutra of Formerly, I studied, Formerly, I practiced" in the Sutra of the Diamond Sutra. It is translated from the metaphysics by Jing Shitian in the Meiji era.
Its branches include the body, natural theology, and its extensions.
The body theory is "to study to the end which names represent real existence, which names only represent a concept."
Naturalism denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason proposed by philosophers who support scientific and evolutionary theories.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to a research method that makes no mention of God.
Phenomenology is a branch of philosophy that studies consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain).
The two-pronged approach and the one-pronged approach are the two main schools of thought that discuss the relationship between the spirit and the body.
Philosophy of knowledge is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Philosophy is a systematic study of human moral life. Here, morality is defined as a set of rules recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into ethical philosophy (abstract research of ethical theory or criticism), and normative ethics (evaluation of various different ethical views, and giving moral rules for correct or incorrect behavior).
Its researchers should abide by what kind of ethical norms), apply utilitarianism (the academic study of applying utilitarianism to real life, including biological utilitarianism and political utilitarianism), and describe utilitarianism (the collection of information about how people live, from observation to summary).
It is not based on the expected theoretical starting point, but on the investigation of the actual moral agent (moral agent) and the real choices made, which have become all the moral factors of this decision, and it discusses the moral views held by social groups.
The history of philosophy includes Greek Roman philosophy, medieval Christian philosophy.
Part 1: The humanistic ideology of liberalism, represented by people such as Voltaire and Montesquieu.
Second part: The humanistic thought of religious reform represented by Calvin.
The third part: political liberalism, represented by Machiavelli, modern liberalism (17th-18th century, British experience liberalism, represented by Hume, 17th-18th century, continental rationalistic liberalism, represented by Spinoza, 18th century, French Enlightenment liberalism, represented by Voltaire, 18th-19th century, German idealistic liberalism, represented by Kant and Hegel, 18th-19th century, British utilitarian liberalism, represented by Bentham and James Mill, 19th century, British evolutionary liberalism, represented by Spencer and Herbert Spencer, 19th century, German neo-Kantian liberalism, represented by Li Keqiang and others, 19th century, German neo-Hegelian liberalism, represented by Thomas Hill Green and others), transitional liberalism (non-rationalistic liberalism, represented by Charles Comte and others).
Logic is a discipline that studies the "principles and standards of effective argument and proof."

Yang Xiong, whose original name was Jia Bo, was born in the sheep year and the sheep month. He lived in the sheepfold, and was content with what he had. He was called "Elder Brother Sheep".
Because of the publication of the "Strange Codex" series of "Thailand Strange Records", "India Strange Records", "Japan Strange Records" and "South Korea Strange Records" and other works, there is a "mysterious reputation" in the industry, and he himself is "excellent at saying eight ways to make a fortune".
“Doubtful Tales from China”, also known as “Strange Stories from China”, takes you deep into the essence of Chinese folk tales with a brand new work, “Doubtful Tales from China”. What are the stories behind those folk tales that have been passed down for generations?
Nan Xiaolong, an "irregular traveler", and Moon Wuhua, who has repeatedly opened up the exploration of death, are about to reveal their identities.
The sheep with "doubts" had its head shaved and sold millions of copies of the book!
The same author, the same protagonist, and the continuation of the unfinished story of "Thailand's Strange Stories" and "India's Strange Stories" after "Strange Code"!
That's enough to buy a bottle of ketchup
You call the dining room to come
I don't want to go downstairs to buy things, and I will spend so much money to call for outside sales.
Ding Zilin: Thank you.
I sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian help in the past 30-plus years, especially in the early 1990s when I appealed for help under my real name to domestic and overseas friends. Up to now, the help has never been interrupted.
Now, most of the old parents of the refugees have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started work.
It is your volunteer help that has gotten us through the most difficult times.
At present, the new coronavirus situation is fluctuating worldwide, and most donors have retired.
Therefore, I sincerely ask you to suspend the donation to the Tiananmen Mother's Group, which should have been a perfect ending.
I will always remember your love and believe that your dedication will be recorded in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
According to the ceramic industry: I would like to take this opportunity to introduce the history of the 32 years of humanitarian assistance carried out by the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Fund (MCDF) in the United States.
In the process of carrying out humanitarian assistance, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Minneapolis-based Chinese Democracy Fund are parallel organizations, and the executors of the project often cross over.
（Apple Daily Photo: The Tiananmen Mother Station is responsible for the ceramic industry.）pic.twitter.com/UxID
Rescue funds are often unable to be delivered smoothly to the hands of those in need.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Professor Ding, a special group called "Mother of Tiananmen" was set up to coordinate and manage the reception and distribution of donations.
In 1998, the MCDF set up the "Six Four Orphans Education Fund". After 11 years, in 2009, after all the Six Four orphans graduated from university, the MCDF set up the "Six Four Elderly and Poverty-stricken People Assistance Fund" and has been in effect since then.
The funds for these projects came mainly from campus and social donations in the year of 1964, from personal donations, and were supported by the Democracy Fund of the Chinese University Alumni Association.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Research Foundation.
It was not until last year, 31 years later, that the victims of the June 4th Incident finally received a portion of the donations made in the name of June 4th in Hong Kong that year.
During this period, "China Human Rights" also carried out its independent humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding cancelled the donation on June 4th. It was for the donors to consider. We are all retired and our income is not as abundant as before. We specially wrote a thank-you letter to Teacher Ding's "kind people".
We will respect the difficult decision to terminate the project within two years and resume it as needed.
For those who have been adhering to kindness and tolerance for many years, and those who are brave enough to take risks to deliver humanitarian aid, we express our gratitude and respect.

Member evaluation
Effect: Photo effect: Wearing a two-piece suit, the overall look is not bad. I like this set of photos the best.
Service details: Because I was pregnant, I was a little uncomfortable. The make-up artist and staff were very considerate. They let me rest for a while. They also gave me cold water to drink.
Set price: 1000 yuan
Thank you, Rabbit, for your comments. I was going to say that the old style is not suitable for the old style. I did not expect that the finished product is too beautiful.
Thank you, Denmark, for your recognition. Your satisfaction can make us full of energy and continue to move forward. We will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend all my little partners to come!
No matter from reception, make-up, clothing, lighting, photography to the later stage, there is no problem.
Make-up artists are particularly meticulous. They will match your make-up to your style, and only use top-line cosmetics.
Teacher Tian Liang doesn't need to say it anymore, photography is a pretty professional job.
The whole workshop has a very artistic atmosphere, and there are two little cats playing around.
We are in Beijing. The good movie theaters in Beijing need to be booked in advance for half a year. My colleagues have filmed in Beijing, and the film is just so so.
I specially visited this office, a place with a soul.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and I think this is also the short version of most people. Photographer Liang Ge will take pictures and record the wonderful moments.
Make-up artist, photographer, later design, a good team.
When the film came out, we and the people around us all praised it.
She has recommended the movie to others, and she was also very happy when she watched the end of the movie.
It is hoped that such workshops will not be buried, and more people will find their own style, rather than a thousand rules.
Thank you very much for the five-star review of Xian Eagle and Jing Heng. Both of them are very creative and imaginative new people. We are an advertising agency. As long as the customer likes us, we will do our best to complete the task. Thank you for meeting and knowing each other.
The sweet assistant, the lively photographer teacher, and every member of the team were super nice. It was a wonderful shoot and a memorable experience. The effect was much better than I had imagined. Thank you everyone for your hard work. 😘😘
Thank you, Xiao Yu, for your comments. We are also a kind. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, our trust is so many kilometers. I'm so happy to meet you. I'm looking forward to coming to Qinhuangdao to play next time.
How do I give money?
The re-sent meal has been sent

The restaurant staff called me now
One wants to share his personal programming experience.
If you want to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to do training, but if you don't have the idea, self-study is the best. After all, the training costs a lot of money and takes 6 months to learn.
However, if you are going to enter this industry, training is a very good choice. Especially for those with weak self-discipline, training is a very good choice.
If you have a strong self-study ability, you can also choose self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First, we should look at the teaching force of this institution. If the teaching force is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, the teaching force of some new training institutions is not particularly strong.
Second, before choosing, it is better to explore this training institution. It is best to explore the students of this institution. After all, only the students of this institution know how this institution is. The course is good or bad.
Hello, to be honest, I don't know how to answer your question, because I don't know your personal situation, and learning this thing and your personal situation have a great relationship.
For example, professional, age, and the language you want to learn are all related to the industry you want to study.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or if you are a computer major who has graduated, I suggest self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays, many online and offline training institutions are quite good, but the cost of learning is high and the investment time is longer. Basically, it needs to focus on training for 3-6 months.
However, if it is what I said, self-study is very convenient. Now, many learning resources on the network are free, or there are many training resources at the B station. If you don't find resources, you can also contact me through an introduction to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, it is recommended to learn from training institutions. Learning is not tiring, the teacher's explanations are detailed, and there are people who specialize in answering questions. In addition, it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
In addition, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, with a quota for internal promotion. After learning, they are recommended to the company, and the interview process after finding a job can also be saved.
The above is some of my views. Because I don't know your situation, I only roughly introduced it. If you have other suggestions, you can contact me at any time for exchange and communication.
I said I saw it on the App at 1 o'clock.

Thank you to those who silently supported me. I will continue to work hard to support my life.
Life will not belittle anyone's efforts. I will pay attention to those who like me and thank those who support me silently.
Life is like this. People only see the results, but they don't see their own process. In the face of life, in addition to being strong, we must continue, there is no choice, the road can be turned back, but it can't go back...
Cleaning is work, but also a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of dedication.
Although we are doing the dirtiest work, we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the customer's home, see the satisfied smile and upright thumb of the customer, and at that moment, all the accumulation is worth it, and the return is worth it!
My daily work
——Your requirements, my service.
Use your heart to serve, use your heart to be clean, and stay beautiful.
The details that you are concerned about have been taken care of by Feng Gui Home.
Keep the house clean and tidy, plant trees and flowers, and serve the people.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although the water crystal is beautiful, it will become dull if it is not cleaned for a long time. Only after being cleaned can it emit light. Life is also like this.
It can be successful if you do it with your heart, and it can be fine if you do it with your details. We are serious about our work.
Give me a chance, I'm sure you'll be satisfied. Quality is everything, because professionalism deserves to be trusted. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
At present, all walks of life are not good!
However, I always believe that as long as you are serious, you can hold on, and you can work hard, you will do better than others, at least you will be stronger than complaining!"
Every day is a new day, and all good things begin in the morning. I hope you have a happy, lucky, healthy, and auspicious start. Begin a new day and maintain a good mood for the whole day. Good morning.
As a child, happiness is something you have; as an adult, it is something you chase after; in maturity, it is something you realize.
Be the best of yourself, follow your heart, and be without regrets in life; one road for life, walk your own path; two treasures in life: good health and a good mood, live a beautiful life to the end!
Every stage of life will encounter different difficulties.
Many times, being tied down is not a lack of ability, but an active courage.
Since you can't avoid it, you might as well face it.
The more afraid you are, the more likely you are to be knocked down by difficulties; if you face up to difficulties, the problem will eventually be resolved.
Chinese and Saudi curators co-hosted the first contemporary art exhibition in Saudi Arabia - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou, Huang Jing) The first contemporary art biennale in Saudi Arabia - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriyah JAX Art District located in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China and other places participated in the exhibition.
The dual-year exhibition was jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Dual-Year Exhibition Fund and the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China. Tian Liuyu, Director of the UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary art in China, served as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the two-year exhibition is "crossing the river by feeling the stones", which implies the reform measures adopted during the social and economic transformation, but also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabia's social and cultural development.
The two-year exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and spans six interconnected buildings, which are presented in six units: "Crossing the River to Touch the Rock," "Inheriting as an Experiment," "Borderline Thinking," "Going Public," "A Beautiful New World," and "The Spirit of Art."
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including paintings, installation art and performance art in various forms; the works of 12 Chinese artists are also worthy of attention. Some artists use recycled materials to create works in new and innovative ways, such as Xu Bing, who reconstructed a classic landscape painting from discarded materials in the series "Background Story" (2014).
Barclay, the Chief Executive Officer of the Diriyah Two-Year Exhibition Foundation, said that he hopes that this two-year exhibition can establish international dialogue, so that the global audience can have the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction.
Tian Miao said: "The goal of the two-year exhibition is dual. It can not only make Saudi contemporary art participate in the global dialogue, but also make Saudi audiences integrate into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the two-year exhibition period. Artists, curators and leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: standardized management of rural public welfare positions - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in helping the poor to find jobs and consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation and development, Yunnan Province issued relevant policies to promote the management of public welfare positions in rural areas to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, at present, Yunnan has opened 448,300 rural public welfare positions for employment, which are used for the employment of rural poverty-stricken groups such as the settlement of poverty and the alleviation of poverty, and have played an important role in helping the poor to increase their income, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively enhance the rural public service capacity.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments and agencies, including the Yunnan Provincial People's Social Security Foundation, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, and mainly unified the regulations on the target scope, fund management, position development, and position management of rural public welfare personnel recruited by the grassroots.
In the aspect of position development, the new regulations clearly stipulate that the position development should be carried out according to the principles of "on-demand establishment, establishment of people, dynamic management, and total control", "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible", and "one person, one position, and voluntary publicity".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the announcement, application, examination, publicity, employment, pre-employment training and arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare positions, and stipulate that the development departments of rural public welfare positions should purchase commercial liability insurance for the staff of rural public welfare positions. The relevant departments should regularly supervise the issuance of subsidies for rural public welfare positions.
The address is wrong
Hello
Is it possible to cancel the order?
I re-ordered
Has it been cancelled?
Second, although the right has a glorious era in history, it is short, so it is short-lived because it is easy to be happy when the sun shines and to sweat when the water is drunk; it is a little more convenient to be optimistic and to be attacked by the hair.
However, in reality, the right has played an active role in the progress of society.
Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, the development of the economy has promoted science and technology and promoted the institutionalization of the government and the protection of human rights. The positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied.
Third, in my opinion, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's remarks, I am interested in his remarks and I also respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also serious about China's social issues.
However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that the revolution is unnecessary, and the revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, damage to people's livelihood, and the muddling of political parties. It is precisely because foreign forces take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, in order to change or improve China, we must have patience and be responsible for the country and the people. Political opportunists who try to fish in the fire are not on the right, they are muddled.
Let's talk about it.
On the one hand, it is actually a child of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will also listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their ideas when necessary. If the left has not been transformed, it is because the left only wants to pick up the garbage thrown away by the Communist Party!
Fifth, I recently saw some friends who were panicked by the anti-corruption campaign and were very angry. I think it is unnecessary.
It's useless to try to reason with those who embezzle money and those who are addicted to drugs.
We should not try to prove that we are right, and we should not try to make the antagonists and the leftists admit that we are right. Why should we do that?
I told my friends this way: When the anti-revolutionaries abuse you with five hairs, when the leftists abuse you with the right dog, it really proves that our middle way is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young. When they grow old, they forget their ideals, or they pursue their ideals, only to suffer from prejudice.
And the ideal gradually fades away, and even the Dragon Boy finally becomes an evil dragon.
On the whole, I think it refers to restraint and freedom. China should be left-leaning from the genes of its historical and cultural heritage.
Domestic right-wing liberals focus on efficiency and development, while left-wing liberals emphasize fairness and security.
At present, the general public hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, the conflict between China and the United States is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, I'll give you a thumbs up.
I didn't say anything, the flowers are so beautiful.
In the past two years, the US has blocked and encircled Huawei's chips, which has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented dilemma, but also caused huge losses to "US-related" enterprises.
The United States has put pressure on China's semiconductor industry, requiring its own enterprises and allied enterprises to lock down China's semiconductor industry. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global semiconductor suppliers are affected, and the research and development investment of semiconductor production enterprises is reduced, resulting in a shortage of the global semiconductor supply chain.
Today, the "shortage" has spread to all major industries around the world, such as the shutdown of car companies and the rise in mobile phone prices. Almost all industries that use chips are affected by it.
In order to grasp the "chip" self-determination, more and more countries' scientific and technological giants are beginning to move towards the "de-Americanization" road.
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor industry, the United States has frequently taken actions recently, and has hosted the "Summit of the semiconductor industry". It has also invited 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, and has subsidized and supported the development of the United States' local science and technology giant, for example, Intel, the old technology giant, has invested US$20 billion to open two diamond processing plants in Arizona, the United States, to win the leadership in the chip industry.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is very likely to snatch the "bowl" of TSMC.
The reason for such confidence is that Intel, as a U.S. tech giant, has been cultivating the semiconductor industry for decades and has a large number of talents and technological reserves. It is certain to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongjie, the founder of Thalys, was not impressed by Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Mastermind Think Tank" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongqiu made a shocking statement that for Intel's investment in the construction of a diamond factory, Zhang Zhongqiu had no hesitation to say that Intel's investment in the chip factory was equivalent to a joke.
The reason why Zhang Zhongqiu is reluctant to Intel's entry into the crystal field is that Zhang Zhongqiu still harbors an old grudge against Intel for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was a jewel in the manufacturing industry of the United States. It was the leader of the world's semiconductor industry.
In the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductors were monopolized by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. Chips were designed, manufactured and tested by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model makes some small enterprises unable to bear the burden, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face the huge construction costs of the production line and can only hope.
Inspired by the market demand, after the 1980s, the chip industry began to see the phenomenon of subcontracting cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmu heard that there was a company specialized in chip design, and he thought that if there is a company specialized in design, it could set up a factory specialized in wafer manufacturing.
Shortly thereafter, Zhang Zhongliang's idea became reality, and the power station was put into operation.
Tai Jui Electric aimed its main business at the "crystal processing" single link, without designing, only providing the crystal manufacturing outsourcing service.
At that time, Taiwan Semiconductor, which had just been established, was just a small ant in front of Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongqiu once found Intel investment, but at that time, Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing links of the semiconductor industry, which was obviously a little self-righteous, and it was unacceptable to TSMC.
Zhang Zhongyin also believes that Intel was unbeatable at the time.
I didn't expect that the giant of crystal manufacturing services would begin to be replaced by crystal.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongyin thought that Intel's entry into the crystal era was very humorous.
The market value of TSMC has now exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of the strong offensive of TSMC, Intel is also unwilling to be self-sufficient.
Today, TSMC has rushed to 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It is not difficult to surpass it.
Not equal

Let's take a look at some of the most popular searches today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot spots were randomly selected: the two-headed dragon in February, the rise in the price of beautiful friends, and the cargo ship incident. The popularity spread, forming a peak, and then the index fell (smooth curve), finally dissipating. If there is a secondary popularity, there will be a small peak again.
They seem to be quite different from the "network pornographic performance model" that was exhibited by the official website of Sina Weibo.
What is an abnormal situation?
Six hot spots were randomly selected from the same event, and presented in the form of a "solitary peak", a "sawtooth" and a "broken cliff".
【Isolated Peak】 means that people take the initiative to warm up and surge forward rapidly, attracting public attention; 【Gear-shaped】 means that periodic heating is used to ensure that the topic remains hot; 【Cliff-shaped】 means that the masses withdraw, and the heat surge fulfills its "function", receives a new task, and rushes to the new battleground.
In Figure 9, the peak of one event coincides with the trough of another event. There is no time difference. It must be that the unified water army received the task and opened a new round of offensive.
The professionalism of black public relations can be seen at a glance: dozens of hot search listings at the same time, which are eye-catching, which are responsible for science and technology, which are attractive, which transfer focus, which affect cognition, which mislead judgments, which stir up emotions, and which make decisions. The black PR account is divided into batches and subdivided into details, considering all the elements in the publicity and diffusion.
Communication is a science. Throw out all subjective factors such as position and emotion, and use only objective data. Black public relations will also change everywhere.
Everyone who passes by must leave a mark, and we dug it out together.

360 Home Furnishing
Address: No. 156, Xingfu Garden, Huancheng South Road
At the beginning, it was introduced by friends because of trust, so I chose to come and have a look. My budget was 70,000 yuan for basic renovation.
When he came to the store, he began a series of tricks.
I went to the store for the first time, and all I did was show them my floor plan. They didn't even go to the site to measure the house. They gave me a quote of $70,000 for my 135-square-metre house. I had a quick look at their materials, and I didn't know what brand they were.
Their second scam is that they drag you to the counter and make you pay the deposit (and the money is non-refundable, unless you have enough experience and bargain with them).
When I hesitated to sign the contract, they invited their so-called manager to tell me how many discounts I would get if I signed the contract with them.
This is a big pit, and I am a living example of being cheated. When my head is excited, I have transferred more than 10,000 yuan.
His quotation had a lot of problems. It was 70,000 yuan excluding the water and electricity reform, and excluding any doors and cupboards in the bathroom.
Their service fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost confidence in the company. I didn't sign the contract because I didn't understand anything at the beginning.
When I went to get my money back, they put up a very professional front, with a special little team to deal with you.
No matter what, it is the customer's problem.
There are all kinds of eviction responsibilities, as well as a lot of details. I don't want to say them one by one. I don't want to choose them, because my friends also found that the quality of the renovated house is not good, and then you have to pay all kinds of fees.
The clown, they are the original head of the dragon costume, now changed into a big beauty, it seems that it has been closed and changed into something else.
Therefore, do not choose such a shoddy construction company.
Later, everyone will check these consultations when choosing, because the renovation is not a small money.

The Perseids will bring a great meteor shower on August 14 - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) As the last large-scale meteor shower this year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it after midnight on that day.
On December 13, 2018, Beijing amateur astronomer An Jiu filmed the double star rainbow in Qinghai.
Most of the parent celestial bodies of meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent celestial body of the Perseids is 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The twin stars' meteor shower is also the second meteor shower that is not caused by the "pregnancy" of the stars.
Peng Li, a member of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomy and popular science, introduced that, just like the eclipses of the sun and the moon, the Perseids generally appear in late summer, and the "broadcast period" can be from December 4 to December 17.
The Perseids are characterized by a large and steady flow, and together with the Orionids and the Geminids are known as the three major meteor showers of the Northern Hemisphere.
A prominent feature of the double-headed dragon's meteor shower is that the meteor speed is slow, the color is rich, and there are many fire meteors. It is suitable for both visual observation and the beginning astronomical photographer.
Yang Jing, an amateur astronomer in Tianjin, took a photo of the double star rainbow in Zhou Dynasty, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
According to the astronomical forecast, this year's Geminid meteor shower will usher in a great peak on December 14 at about 15:00, and the ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour under the ideal observation conditions, with the radiant located at the top of the sky) will be 150.
The Double Seventh Festival Rainbow Recommendation Chart.
Last year, the double-satellite rainbow of "Falling Angels" left a deep impression on people, but this year's double-satellite rainbow will be affected by moonlight interference, and the degree of brilliance will be a little discounted.
The 14th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar is November 11, and the moon is a full moon. The bright moonlight will cause interference to the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the latter half of the night, and at this time, the radiation point of the Geminids will also be relatively high.
Friends who like the meteor shower can observe it in the hours after midnight, but they should pay attention to cold weather protection. "
How can we observe more auroras?
It is not recommended to observe the moon in the city. You can choose a place with an open view to the northeast in the suburbs or the countryside, and wait patiently until the moon is down. Then you can observe the moon.
It is worth noting that the flow rate of the double-headed dragon's meteor shower is very large in all directions. When observing, it is not necessary to always stare at the radiation point of the double-headed dragon meteor shower.
Friends who like photography should choose a wide-angle lens with a large aperture to take beautiful "flower rain" shots. When shooting, use a high ISO and the largest aperture.
Based on stability and sustainability, the three-legged stool, backup battery and emergency line are also indispensable. "
Peng said.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in the market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the theme should be the liquid crystal TV, and the difference between the laser TV and the liquid crystal TV in the market positioning is mainly the following two points:
First, laser TV focuses more on the large screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of liquid crystal televisions, laser televisions are more focused on the market for large-screen televisions. That is to say, laser televisions are born for the large-screen market.
At present, the size of mainstream liquid crystal televisions is mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of laser televisions is generally above 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the output and sales of laser TVs have continued to increase, accounting for more than 60% of the total sales of TVs above 80 inches.
According to the prediction of China International Capital Corporation, in 2020, the sales of the laser TV market will increase by more than 140%, and will continue to maintain high-speed growth.
The reason for the good performance in the large screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser TV in the protection of the eye.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of the liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulus to the eyeball is smaller.
Researchers from the Xisi Laboratory of the China Electronics Technology Standardization Research Institute and the ophthalmology experts from the Beijing Union Hospital compared the strict test data of laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions, and obtained 144 groups of test data.
Data show that laser TV does have a strong eye protection effect, and even has a certain improvement in certain aspects.
At a time when visual health is becoming more and more important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV focuses more on the high-end market.
In contrast, the price of liquid crystal televisions has continued to decline. At present, the price of laser televisions sold in the market is mostly above 10,000 yuan. With the upgrading of size and light sources, prices have gradually risen.
What makes laser TV so expensive?
It is undeniable.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TV has many advantages that cannot be achieved by liquid crystal TV and projection.
With the help of ultra-short throw projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment. It can achieve a 100-inch screen experience at a short distance, and the required space is not large, and the host is small and takes up little space.
In terms of brightness, the big brand LED TV can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
Together with the lower heat generation, the power consumption is small, and the lifetime of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and simulated screens, which can bring users a more shocking visual and auditory experience.
Instead of talking about artificial needs, we need to talk about the products of fine division of needs. Talking about the quality of pictures and the proportion of investment and output, laser TV is not a dish for film and television players. If you want to consider both the big screen and the viewing environment, you can try. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. You can judge for yourself after weighing the pros and cons.
To put it simply, ultra-wide angle projection - laser TV, in order to get close to the screen, it is necessary to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflective mirrors, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to block some environmental light, a micro-structured Fresnel screen is used, which is expensive, and the price of the 80-inch screen is basically the same as that of a 65-inch liquid crystal screen.
There is another point. I particularly detest the practice of projector manufacturers boasting that their projectors have a high contrast ratio. In fact, what they mean is that the light reflected by the projector is directly incident on the screen. If you reflect it to the ceiling, you cannot see it with your eyes. This is also true of LCD and plasma TVs. If you don’t turn them on, they don’t light up, do they?
In addition, if the projection screen is not reflective, it will not work at all.
The hot spot effect of the high-gain screen was ignored, and a large number of light was reflected to the eye from a certain angle, which was really hard to bear.

Adding the WeChat booking date, the little sister sent me the time arrangement of the selected time. The reply information is more timely than before.
I watched the shooting works in the store before, there are more outdoor wedding dresses, they are very beautiful, and the shooting style involved is also very much.
On the same day, I exchanged my ideas with my little sister and helped me try two suits of my style. Finally, I decided to start the make-up. The photographer took some props and guided the action. He was also very meticulous about every detail.
However, it may be that because we did not exchange specific shooting ideas, the style shot is not what I want, but it should be good.
After shooting, the photographer will help choose the photos, exchange the style of the later period, and feel the meticulousness.
The repaired piece will take about half a month. The effect of waiting is ~
The second photo-taking king's meal event - most of the clothing in the venue can choose a photo.
Finally, she chose a black lace dress with different styles.
The whole shooting process took about 2 hours, including make-up and shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting is the younger brother of the 95s. I felt a little bit nervous. I hope to give more suggestions in the future in the guidance of customer shooting. The shooting process is more enjoyable.

I'm on the front page, come and take a look at Queenie's place.
After filling in the name and phone number, you can choose the wedding dress. You can also choose the wedding dress. You can change three or four sets of clothes. The make-up will last for a long time. The service attitude is also good. After taking photos, you will be taught how to pose. It will take half a month. You will receive it in three or four days. It feels the same as the original one.
The overall environment is still good.
There are many options for suits.
The make-up position is just three steps away from the photo studio.
The service is enthusiastic and meticulous.
The shaper is patient.
The photographer will also teach you how to act.
Unhappy with the results, the photographer may also initiate a retake.
【Experience】The shape may be a little exaggerated. The original double eyelid was pasted with three eyelids.
The tail was also cut off, which was a bit embarrassing for me as I usually don't paint my tail.
The photo was sent for ten days, but the P effect was not very satisfactory, and the feeling of double eyelid glue was still obvious.
Because I'm not clear about the style, I've tried two suits. The result is hit or miss. I've also chosen a black suit. My sister said this suit is more retro than the other one.
After choosing a suitable dress, I began to do my makeup. The hairdresser and makeup artist sisters were very patient in helping me. The effect turned out to be very satisfying.
I started taking photos after I had my makeup done. The photographer instructed me on how to pose the whole time. The process was very smooth and harmonious.
After filming, he carefully chose four of his favorite works. The little boy said he was satisfied with the outcome.
No reply for 3 days... Since your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that every time I pay, I use the same credit card
I have to pay shipping fees every time now.
Can you waive the penalty and collect my monthly fee after you finish the investigation?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance platform.
From the point of view of setting conditions: According to the "Administrative Measures on the Supervision of Insurance Intermediaries (2015 Amendment)"Administrative Measures on the Supervision of Intermediaries (2015 Amendment)", in order to become an insurance intermediary, it must meet three key words: the shareholder and the initiator must not have any major violations in the past three years, the minimum registered capital is 50 million yuan, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In fact, these three points are very strict. In summary, it is to have strength, to pass the approval of the national authoritative department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (regulates the nation's insurance companies and banks), and the shareholders must have a good style. As the small umbrella insurance of the insurance agency, the insurer does not need to doubt the legitimacy of the small umbrella insurance whether it is legal or not. After all, there are these three threshold.
On this point, it is also good and worthy of trust.
From the perspective of insurance products: The small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies' stars' serious illness products are sold on this platform. For example, the latest Thai Super Deluxe No. 5 serious illness, the insured and the beneficiary are both Thai people. The small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary. We should not doubt its credibility.
From the perspective of payment mode: the products of Internet platform have lower business costs and labor costs than offline stores, so the Internet products are generally of higher prices and more flexible payment modes, which can support monthly payments, reduce the payment pressure on insured people, and maximize the leverages of insurance.
This is also very good.
It can be considered.
From the point of view of professionalism: this is particularly important because insurance is an industry that requires a high degree of professionalism. Many Internet product customers can insure themselves, which will lead to many misunderstandings. Insurance practitioners often add their subjective consciousness when they insure. They think they are healthy or suitable. This makes it easy to have many hidden dangers and risks that may be denied.
I myself have worked as an insurance telephone salesperson in "Tencent Micro-Insurance" (like Xiaomi Insurance, also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), so I know how responsible I am.
The insurance of the Internet is real, and it is also reliable. It is not reliable that people rely on it. The Internet channel does not have professional practitioners, and there are many sales misleading.
For example, 1 yuan of insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phone, free to enjoy 60,000 serious illness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but it is to avoid the heavy and light, will not tell the insurance person, the first month 1 yuan, the next month is the need to pay the normal charge, dozens to 200 is not equal, many customers do not know how much they have paid for their own insurance for two years.
He thought he could spend 10,000 yuan to buy the insurance, but the insurance company only gave him 600,000 yuan.
Free mobile phones are only sent to special policy numbers such as 6666 and 8888. If the winning message is sent, it will not be exchanged, and no one will remind you.
This is another pitfall for the insured. The free insurance of 60,000 yuan is only for a short term. If the insured only relies on this free insurance and has no other commercial insurance, the 60,000 yuan will not be enough to solve the problem if the insured is seriously ill.
At present, for the misleading sales of Internet insurance, the country is also strictly cracking down.
Therefore, in summary, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the professionalism and professionalism of the businessman.
It is suggested that the main topic should be comprehensively considered. In fact, many offline insurance companies have more products. Customers can choose more opportunities and products. Some products are also more cost-effective than Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers and guaranteed offline products, saving each person 2,000-3,000 yuan per year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
I: I am an insurance agent of Mingya Insurance, with more than 3 years of experience in enterprise management training, serving nearly 1,000 enterprise users, and cooperating with more than 100 insurance companies. Before the insurance premium is paid, I will start from the needs of customers to customize insurance products for customers. During the insurance premium, I will compare the goods of customers with three insurance companies to get the best insurance result for customers. After the insurance premium is paid, I will do the insurance premium settlement, insurance premium trusteeship for customers, so that customers can feel relieved and at ease.
Grow up with every customer.
I hope my answer can help the topic master!
According to the definition of the insurance supervision department, Internet insurance is an insurance business that can be completed independently by the insured after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insured person does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All the steps can be completed by the insured person.
Although there is no "ceremony" in the insurance of Internet insurance, and even the printed paper contract may not have it, it does not affect the effectiveness and legal effectiveness of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the general workflow of "telephone sales", but the purchase of insurance will also have a fatal problem - the subsequent service may not meet expectations.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract of several decades. When we purchase insurance, should we not carefully think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is a "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us for many years later?

Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of defamation and abuse, and I cannot accept such behavior.
In a civilized society, we can accommodate everything, but we must eradicate this evil.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this kind of uncivilized style.
From the time you started sending friend requests on Facebook and publishing sexually suggestive posts, to when you tried to publish my home address and father's name on social media, I have had an unresponsive attitude.
After that, you not only continue to tag me on a daily basis, but also continue to discuss some obscure, shameful remarks about me with your so-called friends on Facebook. You also talk about my appearance, my body shape, my healthy diet, and other nonsense, such as whether I should plant strawberries on my bed or not. I... have also thought about it.
Afterwards, I received many friend requests from Facebook friends who uploaded a photo of me and wrote remarks with sexual harassment contents.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can't continue to be silent.
After I reported the news, you didn't calm down at all, but became even more agitated.
I don't care about your political background, and I don't care about your social status. In our society, we need to respect all genders.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of degrading, insulting, humiliating speech, you can continue to say that you only care about and are concerned with me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that it's not your doing or continue to publish inflammatory remarks.
No, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and physique don't need your criticism.
I don't even think there is a girl who would be willing to be so disgraced by others.
A friend asked me, is it okay?
I said so, but you didn't believe me.
I don't think any girl can still say she's okay after being treated so despicably.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic decency will choose this way to hurt any woman.
I believe that the road is in the hearts of the people.
I cut some of the comments for you to comment on
Your post should not be copied by others
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization

Vietnamese People's Newspaper - Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc attended the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
During the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major meetings were held to discuss two main topics, namely, the transformation of digital technology enterprises and the country's digital transformation and the economic recovery and development after the pandemic.
Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung said that in 2021, although the COVID-19 outbreak continued to expand, the number of digital technology enterprises in Vietnam and their business revenue still maintained a growth trend of nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam was cultivated to solve the major problems faced by Vietnam. Many digital products have gone out of the country, and the ranking of Vietnam's digital technology has improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology enterprises to shoulder the responsibility of developing the national digital transformation platform, and the task of developing these national digital platforms is to shoulder the national mission.
At the forum, leaders of departments and national agencies are studying, developing, applying, and transferring digital technology enterprises, organizations, and individuals to share motivation and gather all social resources to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, and jointly promote the digital transformation of the country, and the breakthrough ideas and solutions to economic recovery after the outbreak of COVID-19.
When delivering a speech at the forum, Premier Li Keqiang stressed that the digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world and the objective need for development.

The home appliances in this family are neatly arranged, with many brands and well-known brands.
We went to the "Hanston" pure water store. The store was holding an event, and the prices were relatively cheap.
The house has a total of 11 floors, with the second floor to the ninth floor being parking lots, and both the first and second floors are free to park!
The surroundings are not very good. There are only a few shops in the restaurant. The taste of the restaurant is generally mediocre.
This elevator is also amazing. It is just like a big disease. It goes down from the second floor to the first floor and then jerks back. I cannot help pressing this floor. It is also amazing. It goes directly to a furniture store. The storekeeper closes the door. I cannot go out through the safety passageway!
Even his home needs to be upgraded, and there are many places that have not been developed.
Address: No. 555, Beijing North Road, Sha Yibu District, transportation is convenient, the parking lot is big, and it is free of charge during the day.

I can't even remember them all. It's a good place to buy products. I'm tired.
Recently, I wanted to buy a comfortable sofa, and a friend told me that there are a lot of sofas to choose from here. I looked at the sofas of Guo Jiajia and Mei Kemei, and I felt that I could, but it was a little expensive, so I was still in dispute.

China's Yangtze River Delta realizes full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service area - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) The Chongqing Liangleng Water-based Green Integrated Service Area was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water-based green integrated service area officially operated after the Liangshan Water-based Green Integrated Service Area in Sichuan Province's Luzhou on the 8th.
Up to now, the underwater green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Water Transport Administration of the Ministry of Transport, said that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built and put into operation 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the crew, and have played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The water-based green comprehensive service area is another milestone in the construction of green shipping in the Yangtze River. The reception of ship pollutants and the service capability of shipping in the Yangtze River have been significantly improved.
According to reports, the water-based green comprehensive service area is to provide all-round production and life services for the majority of ships and crew members, so as to help the majority of crew members solve the problem of "urgent anxiety".
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas built and put into operation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are integrated with living service, production service and government service, with the theme of green environmental protection, and with ship repair and ship emergency rescue service as a feature, so that ships can "dock and have multiple services" in the port, which will make the crew's work more efficient and their lives more convenient.
The three US aircraft carriers gathered in the periphery of China, and it is rare for the most powerful weapons to visit the Diaoyu Islands. January 17, 2022. Multimedia. The People’s Daily Multimedia reported: The latest news on China-US relations: the latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; the US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy’s arsenal rarely visited the Diaoyu Islands, releasing an important signal to the United States’ allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" of China Vision, on January 9, the satellite found the US aircraft carrier "USS Carl Vinson" near the Strait of Barrak.
The Strait of Malacca connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the West Pacific.
The platform predicts that the "Carl Vinson" will go to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier has carried the F-35C combat aircraft and the CMV-22 "Osprey" transport aircraft.
In addition to the "USS Carl Vinson", there is also the "USS Abraham Lincoln" aircraft carrier that departed from the United States on January 3.
The "Lin Ken" number also carried the F-35C aircraft for the first time, which is the 314th attack squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently deploys the "Ronald Reagan" aircraft carrier in Japan's Yokosuka.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Spruance"-class destroyer "Spruance" and the "Stalker"-class destroyer "Stalker".
The three US aircraft carriers gathered around China. The strongest weapons rarely visited the Diaoyu Islands. On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Trend Monitoring Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers were gathering around China.
（Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness） The aircraft carriers of the United States, Japan and Australia gathered around China The most powerful weapons rarely visit the Diaoyu Islands On January 17, 2022, the CMV-22B aircraft of the US military flew over the route.

The Russian SSBN "Nevada" carrying 20 Trident missiles and several nuclear warheads entered the US naval base at Guam last Saturday (January 15).
The United States, Japan and Australia gathered in China's periphery, which is the most powerful weapon rarely visiting the Korean Peninsula. It is said that this is a signal sent by allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit of the US ballistic missile submarine to the island since 2016 and the second public visit since the 1980s.

Chatting with friends about the recent 26% decline in Meta's share price, which led to a market capitalization of US$25.1 billion, Zuckerberg responded that the company was facing "unprecedented competition", but why?
Meta (originally Facebook) is essentially an advertising company. Its main source of revenue is advertising. Today, the advertising company that makes money is one with a flow channel.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and other functions are all Meta's flow channels.
In addition, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance". Many of the advertisements of Apps outside of Meta are achieved through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta will find it difficult to obtain users' data information, which will affect the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users. It will clearly prompt users whether to allow the App to access their information. Most people's normal response is certainly not to allow.
If Google strikes again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in the previous Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mainly from companies that contribute to China's maritime business.
Meta has about 1,000 staff in its Hong Kong office and a few major agents in the mainland.
If Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, Meta is an indispensable advertising channel. Most of the money spent on advertising goes to Meta.
It is noteworthy that now TT is one of the main competitors of Meta. However, in the past two years, Meta could earn a lot of money from the byte.
All domestic agents are helping with words to advertise on Meta, and the performance of Meta Greater China is also very good.
I haven't studied it recently, but I'm sure it won't be as good as before.
Chinese companies have passed the stage of large-scale overseas spending.
Third, the expansion of new flow channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older and newer platforms such as TT are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only looking at the current income, but also looking at the future expectations.
It is obvious that Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about "the universe".
The new space should be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the new space is longer, and this story should not support Meta's market value for two or three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Don't be fooled by Facebook's current glamour; it still generates $100bn to $200bn in revenue every year. In reality, Facebook is in crisis, and it has no good moat compared with other internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although his several social softwares are more popular nowadays, they are mainstream social softwares, such as Facebook and WhatsApp, but facing the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook also has no confidence, and the competition between the two is intense.
As for the ambitious concept of Zuckerberg space, there is no hope of success in a short period of time. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous. This is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg has changed the company's name and is constantly looking for new ways. However, I think his choice of direction is wrong. It is a dead end. The above is my some thinking, for reference.
