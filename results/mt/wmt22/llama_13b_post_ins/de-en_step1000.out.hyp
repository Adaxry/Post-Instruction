The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# customer and therefore it is not a problem for me.
I only need one number or instruction on what I should do with the package so that it can be tracked as a return from you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a couple of days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179 euros.
I find that really annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get the discount?
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I find that older siblings also benefit from taking care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a quick look, help for a moment, bring the bottle etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are included.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I see no problem.
If your K1 is happy to be alone for a while and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best determine whether this is suitable for your children.
It's not as if he should wrap K2 and spend hours putting him to sleep.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
This may also be the reason for the psychologist's statement.
Because if something actually happens like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to worry about K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you.
Help me find the title of a book, please!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title will not come to me at all, perhaps someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by dousing himself with feed and going into the enclosure of his big cats.
The case is taken over by a female detective who, after a brief investigation, confronts his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats fearful patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid of fire and ends up at this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before every suicide to go to the scene of the suicide and document it and put the photos on the internet.
In the end, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and makes patients ultimately face their fears in the most extreme way.
A woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to death on purpose)
This fight with fear is called "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital that had to do with the fire.
This is the rough action I am quite sure that the book was written by a French author / author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I have to contact my husband first.
That can take a while.
What steps do I have to take now?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Kind, 4 years old, splitter under the thumbnail
Kind, four years old, has wooden splinters under the thumbnail (outer side) over the entire length.
They tried to pull it out with a pincer.
Very difficult to grasp.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance anymore.
I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Thanks to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we have dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can therefore be built into almost any locomotive of the H0 and 0 track widths.
LokSound 5 decoders are available with all common interfaces and are always equipped with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker together with a sound capsule set.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multiprotocol decoder.
He also masters the DCC data format, as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders report to a suitable digital control centre automatically.
It can handle all DCC programming modes, and thanks to RailCom® it is possible to read out CV values on the main track with suitable central control units.
For central control units that can only program 1-255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 gears at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration with mfx-compatible central systems.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake sections as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brake tiles or with direct current.
In addition, he also uses a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum train automation enables automatic pendulum between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC trains.
After my voucher, which did not arrive due to a complaint, will no longer be extended, I will cancel my order worth about

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to drive ahead with booster vaccination
New Omikron cases are causing concern for politicians and scientists in the UK.
Therefore, all adults who have qualified for vaccination in England should receive an offer of vaccination by New Year's Eve.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to speed up the coronavirus booster vaccinations in light of rapidly increasing omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
Until now, the target date was the end of January.
In addition, the British government will provide additional support to speed up the vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Faced with the Omikron variant, we are dealing with an emergency, which is why vaccination must be stepped up urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccination dose.
Let's boost now, said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price at pickup?
I'm in favor of everyone using pronouns
I have sent an application.
The invitation to a conversation came by email today.
I want to answer the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter," but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone help me, please?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's toes either.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
4 of them go.
The only thing I bought today doesn't work
Obviously, the chair had a non-obvious defect at the time of sale.
How can such a mattress damage occur after 9 months?
First on the #PRS_ORG#.
This has been working for about
No longer 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books via the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
They are now available again and I would like to add two chairs to the order and charge you for it.
The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I will write something about domestic violence here.
I have to write something from the soul.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs all too often is that many victims do not want to be helped or think we cannot help them.
It is quite clear to me that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, some of whom are very close to tears, is that everyone is worth being able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to put up with violence.
I often wish I could help... I know I can't.
But it will never be easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
Arcane on Netflix: What is the series like "League of Legends"?

Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim
At least on youngster Johannes Patrick.
Again nothing: For the second time within not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick, looking back to the cup defeat at the beginning of October at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
But after the game she didn't lie down - instead she increased it in the face of the 61:72 (28: 38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Which was even more disappointing than the bare result, as the way of the performance disappointed.
A statistic that represents the entire dilemma is mentioned: the three-try quote was only 13 percent, four tries (all by young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer was given by John Patrick: "After the victory at Tenerife, we were simply not concentrated enough and did not do what we trained for."
That is, to move the ball.
His counterpart, Sebastian Gleim, reacted quite differently: "To win this exciting game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people.
Only 750 spectators were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the game for his team.
He is the best playmaker I have ever coached, said Gleim.
While in Patrick's team, even the performance players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total disaster and got as close as eight points after having been 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for arguing.
On Wednesday (7 p.m.) the Giants receive the Skyliners from Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves again legally and have written to them again.
We reported ourselves a half year ago.
Always like from the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to enthrall his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
At the moment he is touring with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the coronavirus.
Other of his planned appearances in Advent must also be cancelled, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to catch up on their already postponed dates from 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian town of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with passion for a long time.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Women don't like that" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has brought it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blond hair strictly slicked back, and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer unnoticeable in the current German-language music scene.
With the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we can check in advance whether it fits colorwise
It still doesn't work I can only yearn for the cover page but can't turn the pages.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: No new homes through expropriation
The new Federal Building Minister, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
With expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes, said Geywitz in an interview with the Tagesspiegel (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission to deal with the results of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz is not ruling out talks with the FDP in the ruling coalition about tightening up tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, limits on rent increases in strained housing markets, and an expansion of the rent mirror.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market doesn't loosen up despite that, "we'll talk to our coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step of payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be available again?
Or will it ever happen again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Voucher sounds great
Then I will add it to the new order
Many thanks for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipping take?
I have already cut my finger
That is an absolute audacity
At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system brought numerous tornadoes through the USA.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be reported.
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
On Friday night, several tornadoes caused severe damage in the USA and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms leave a trail of destruction some 320 kilometers long, primarily in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area that everything was gone wherever the tornado had passed.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible at all.
He estimates that up to a hundred people have died in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising constantly.
Hello, I just saw that Vitrine #NAME# is sold out.
That is very bad.
Is it still produced?
Is it completely out of stock?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
When do you report?
If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany?
I had sent back an article via the contact form or given up a return, and wanted to know whether this had arrived or been processed, as I had not yet received a confirmation email.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject calls for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees financial bonuses for being vaccinated.
This puts them on a line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The reworking of advertising slogans into calls for vaccinations - following the German model - is also intended to increase readiness for vaccinations.
He has changed companies over which he has lashed out.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously did not stick to his old position and sought something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: so what.
He did not like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I take a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Hello Boron!
I'm currently running an adventure over the Greifenpass for a group of 4 friends and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign specially written for players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arch is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are conceived and now I'm writing the entry adventure and stumble over my own feet in the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to take a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran lake.
The further action should take place there.
A group of goblins is supposed to lurk a few miles from the village and lure the heroes into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: persuade, act, threaten, recognise danger early on, whatever comes to mind for the players.
Group size: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords
If they are not noticed, the goblins lurk in a hollow way for the hero and flank the carriage to the left and right with bows, while two stop the carriage with spears.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes all fall unconscious and are subsequently found and healed by the village schoolmaster's son, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
2. If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf and two of his apprentices jump in and help the hero in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything is super.
How do you stop the Deus ex Machina of solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a decisive role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I did not expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely adopt many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would still like to send them back
If you can get the receipts, I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be picked up again or just the loading area?
I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to clear the air with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race in order to start the F1 coverage on time.
Although the schedule was far behind due to the delayed start and the accident at the start, it would still have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision.
However, it seems that for legal reasons F1 has priority and therefore everything else must be restricted, so that Sky DE had no choice.
Nevertheless, stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the end of the race.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: Commentator Olivier Zwartyes accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher showed their lack of knowledge of the rules in Formula 1, and both of them did not know that you are allowed to change your tires under a red flag.
Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change the tires when there were appropriate radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was an option for Verstappen.
In my opinion, one should simply know such elementary rules if one comments on Formula 1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first riddle that has now become possible or mandatory according to the rules, both have simply constant uncertainties about the rules.
In general, the artificial commentary style of Roos is not liked, but it is admitted that it is a matter of taste.
But I seriously like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
This is accompanied by constant silliness, which makes both of them simply seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee with (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or Ralf Schumacher's "UuuuuHD".
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, advertising is simply taking over at Sky, in the final round Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as one can hear on F1TV, there only the German soundtrack without commentary is available after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF does that.
These two channels also make less advertising in training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air channel.
I have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that covers F1.
Seriously, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
So, in any case, the grandiose F1 season is a lot less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# pendulum light, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me she would check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the material has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Lüfterpumpen are ideal for supplying additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system over an airlift.
This series is available in three versions from us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
You can compare the performances there.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect more outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. However, fan pumps are also available to emphasise a particular feature in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (available from us in the shop) or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here a treasure chest, mussel or similar could be mentioned.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected via a 4/6 mm air hose to an extractor or similar...and it's ready to go.
The fan pump should be at the same level, or higher than the water level and mounted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent the water from flowing backward through the pump and out of the basin...
If the fan is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps.
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify a processing time of 3 days for eBay, the items are picked up daily and the parcels are also collected daily.
If everything is going well, it goes very quickly.
We just want to avoid anyone being disappointed because it took a little longer this time.
It's like that, not everyone has an understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics industry... of course, there's no stopping Corona.
Please do not judge immediately, just because the delivery is delayed, that is exclusively the fault of the postal service.
Of course, one likes to curse these services, even if we are saying at the moment...they have it very difficult
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be mean to anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that better times will come again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in white?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first US American in space, a TV moderator and four other passengers made a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system from the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon's Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
With a bright blue sky as a backdrop, Bezos greeted the freshly minted astronauts in person after their return.
Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, the flight lasted 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard, who was the first American in space (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company; the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineering Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for their tickets.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley remembered the mission of her father.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
She just went along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed himself enthusiastically.
He would like to return to space immediately, the moderator said.
New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometers high
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automatically.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, sometimes with weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the boundary of space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin's third manned spaceflight: On the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second, in October, saw 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", attend, along with former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, businessman Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's vice-president, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
With one click, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently glow in one color or whether its entire color spectrum should be played out.
Exposed to color changes, the glowing stone keeps its light color for about a minute before gently changing to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light means it is weatherproof all year round.
In snowy surroundings, its light is particularly good – only the duration of the light is impaired once the days get shorter.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry
I am currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and I find the subject itself quite exciting and I am not disturbed by the laboratory (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical).
Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before the study. At that time, however, I also thought that I definitely wanted to study until the doctorate and would.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially the career prospects.
On the one hand (StudyCheck etc.), one always hears about super career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand, one always hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested in:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/What training did you make?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Many thanks for your answers!
At the moment, I'm really unsure and am considering breaking off my studies in 2022 and training to become a computer specialist.
If you have any experience, write about it!
Extra stress before holidays and weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
I had to use my long weekend now to relax.
That's why a post is being added now.
Not only before major holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
As it seems, this also applies on holidays and bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Ascension, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is semi-official.
There was a long four-day weekend last week.
What happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
According to numerous e-mails that absolutely had to be sent before departure, order here, order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because "next week then" after so much time does not sound right?
Or because people want to do so much in a shortened week as they do in a normal week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also very annoyed.
What is the point of this self-imposed lockdown due to holidays?
Why do we even have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent.
My question is simply this: Are we the only ones, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but hasn't got any presents yet.
Even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you just go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the festival by baking and decorating cakes with her son.
I love it, said Catterfeld.
She still has a few things to do before the more contemplative days: "For the first time I have no gifts, I've got to get started now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moult and feather regrowth.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage in avian husbandry can be attributed to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather coat.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to inadequate or imbalanced feeding and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
The unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced in the composition of NEKTON-Bio.
During the application of NEKTON Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can easily be administered through the drinking water or through soft feed.
Many thanks, I have found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
DRG/DR model railway handicraft Altbau E-lok E 95 03, the locomotive was in service in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably originates from the conversion proposal of the model railway enthusiast ME Heft 11/1968. Used, with play wear and missing parts, see photos, Functions well, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn Gesellschaft (DRG), designed for traction of heavy coal express trains in the Silesian network, possibly the model set also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we have made it operational
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to draw up plans for an electric locomotive that could haul 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this line.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was demanded.
As a result, in March 1926 the DRG determined that the AEG was to manufacture the mechanical components and Siemens-Schuckertwerke the electrical components for a 1'C+C1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01 to 06.
All of them survived the Second World War and were found again in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were delivered to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany in November 1952.
The restoration of all six locomotives was judged to be worthwhile in the Reichsbahn maintenance depot in Dessau.
As the progressive electrification of the Central German network led to an increasing need for locomotives for heavy freight train services, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were upgraded in 1959, with the other machines being used as donors for spare parts.
First of all, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 locomotives that were available in large numbers were built up.
Only when it became clear that the upgrading number for the E 94 could not be increased further, did the E 95 come into focus for upgrading.
First, the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They came to the Halle P depot in 1960.
They were mainly used in a dedicated timetable for coal trains from the Geiseltal to Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
As a result, it was not uncommon for Schütze to stick during switching operations.
Then the supervisor, who was constantly travelling on this locomotive, had to hammer and chisel the shield open during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred more frequently and led to months of downtime for the locomotive.
Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new locomotives available and an expansion of the electrical operations was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to forgo old locomotives and most of the smaller categories, so that the E 95 was taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Bahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one crew member, which would have resulted in a problem with the train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service in the middle of 1969, they were followed by the E 95 01, which went out of service on October 5, 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives were dismantled, with the exception of E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was put on display at the main railway station in Halle as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time for those responsible at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worthy of preservation as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began, with the goal of being able to present it at a vehicle exhibition in the RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
The locomotive is cared for in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational readiness of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the museum depot in Arnstadt with its new internal and external paint scheme, and the transformers were checked and five traction motors were made operational.
The locomotives were used on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, proving their worth due to their reliable drive system and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were moved to Leipzig for the central German network.
Its main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function good, there are optical post-processing on the locomotive in own work, covered in dust, with playing tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly the model set also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may bear labels and storage marks.
Those are the F-parts
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held up by two feet... Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I cannot build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately defective.
The middle beam does not fit into the planned holder.
I also receive new ones.
When will they be sent?
No, no flat.
These are the right ones from the shape, they were only too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
They are not flat with me
Could I receive this?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in an apartment in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the neighbouring house in Kinsau (district of Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with minor smoke poisoning, according to the information.
The exact cause of the fire was initially not known, but the police did not assume a deliberate act of arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But that comes much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To counteract fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously made any public statements about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo that shows his coronavirus vaccination.
A friend's illness prompted him to do so, Şahin said.
Uğur Şahin, CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was false information on social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Sahin wrote on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network.
For a few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counter these false rumors.
So far, he has rejected this because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
His school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He did not ask about the reasons.
However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often stoked by false information and mistrust.
Fear is difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with the German Welle is circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself made clear.
It is currently not legal for me to get the vaccine myself, Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization of vaccination in Germany.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has long been lifted - and the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in transformer station: Ten thousand people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no power and in many cases also no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening the lights went out for 41,000 residents in several municipalities due to the fire.
Westnetz, the supplier, reported that numerous emergency backup generators were in use on Saturday until the large-scale disruption was completely fixed late that evening.
Firefighters and volunteers from the THW provided assistance in the communities.
The authorities offered places in schools for supervision and called for help from neighbors.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the primary technology sector, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnet electricians were initially only able to put some cables back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Power flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at around 7.15pm has caused severe damage to parts of the 10,000-volt switching system in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Expensive cleaning and repair works are necessary there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m. those affected by the outage have had power again.
Over 80 Westnetz and partner company technicians were deployed.
After setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for help from neighbors.
It is now important that citizens look after older or single people in their neighbourhood and inform the local fire station if help is needed, explained district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the main focus was on residents of care homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those people who cannot take care of themselves or who need power-dependent medical devices or medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the cover in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the daily cover #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day and stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount it on the tabletop.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions.
We wanted those with a tabletop diameter of #NUMBER#
We got 155 cm in diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# came, but I can't shove them together and thus shorten it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a reply
That's really easier!
Then we'll do it!
Can you send me the return receipt by mail?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
I had not restarted the e-#PRS_ORG# before the purchase.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low discount almost insulting.
We are not in agreement with that
Nordic Combined: Combined skier Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined skiers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to the podium at the world cup in the Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to give way again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had started the cross-country skiing race with a large lead after the ski jump.
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both made it new and use version 4.5...
It could be that they have heard about the problem more often
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it also seems to be on it.
When I want to open it, the message comes, ups!
This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty. Please contact customer service.
As far as I can see, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me further?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I also have to work in between!
So that the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the parts with some soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and allow to dry.
Before you bring the brush with a new color to the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the parts, which will no longer be visible, or on a yoghurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Pull the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers creates an even surface later.
Avoid quick back and forth wiping with the brush.
This results in unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
Otherwise, the dark areas could appear later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to a close with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metal streaks if they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you assemble them.
The original look is achieved by the decals or stickers.
From national emblems on aircraft to ship names and decorative strips and badges on car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the right order as long as the parts are still easily accessible.
A plane's cockpit can be dismantled and reassembled more easily before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are the time, patience and a calm hand when gluing.
Cut out each required decal individually and arrange them.
Decals are also called water slide images because you briefly moisten their reverse with water until the carrier paper goes dark because of the moisture.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit off the paper and put the piece in the corresponding place on the model (which you also wet beforehand).
While holding the decal with a tool, you pull the carrier paper to the side.
Attention: Always check first whether the image is correctly positioned before you completely remove it from the paper so that it doesn't stick to your fingers, wrinkle or even tear.
Remove excess water with a household towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time, as soon as I look at something else, I don't read the book anymore and have to log out and log in and reload the book and find the place where I left off.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in three separate packages at my place
Many thanks anyway!
Then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Do I get it back easily?
Insemination treatment with private health insurance / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for a while, and now when it comes to being reimbursed by the statutory health insurance, they suddenly put up a fight.
One after the other:
We had applied for the insemination procedure with the PKV in advance and were given permission for three attempts.
The trials were in no way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth, which was covered by health insurance.
Some time later we tried to get a second child and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet deduct this from the health insurance.
We again applied for the costs to be taken over by the PKV and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we have carried out more tests than agreed, so logically the most expensive with the health insurance) we sent the bills to the health insurance and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2 + 3) the health insurance only wants to pay for 3 attempts.
The justification: With the pregnancy/birth, the other two attempts of the first approval are forfeited.
The second child is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, however, "the insurance case begins with the healing treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or we (there are 5 attempts to be made)?
* Did the PKV have to point out to us that with a birth the further attempts are cancelled?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Many thanks for your help already!
Could you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again?
Okay.
We will no longer order anything from them.
If they add up my sales and those of my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
They can pass that on to their managers.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund was triggered and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't do anything about the fact that the wardrobe is completely disorganized when it arrives at my place
Please see what the colleague wrote in the screenshot
It is clear and obvious that the repayment was caused and I have still not received a repayment via #PRS_ORG#
They can inform their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
In any case, the guarantee is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cupboard and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional hoppers that need to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them for you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
There is no general definition of a low-budget film with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little or no funding from a major studio or private investor.
There are plenty of lists of low-budget films on the web, for example on letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about it?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours and have already completely furnished two apartments with your furniture.
Wanted to inquire about the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now reliable?
Many thanks
With friendly greetings
If there is no telephone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I give up soon again, because it simply does not work here.
Hello
Halber Sieg" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus's border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Agency (epd).
The EU has not permanently resolved the confrontation, explained the researcher from the Berlin foundation Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not entirely small, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
The treatment of people at the border does not comply with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Apparently, there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided against this, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens the cohesion in the Union.
It is apparently unable to assert itself if a member state decides to go it alone, as is currently the case with Poland, which is not even allowing the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy on the border with Belarus, says Bossong: a basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult by the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" being strengthened.
New attempt to cross the border
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have again attempted to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and taken back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
Polish officials were stoned by the migrants near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers on Friday evening.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or attempted to do so.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko, as the ruler in Minsk, of having locked them in with the prospect of admission to the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to the countries of origin of the people in order to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU's response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
′′ The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions ".
Minsk must also consider domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not counting on the security apparatus regularly shooing thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he allegedly overtook in violation of the rules.
A second appeal was filed against the verdict at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed correctly.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last round and had raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver occurred shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutch driver had overtaken cars in front of him.
I check that.
I speak with the bank and register again with you
Thank you for the support
Free entry for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg fantasy day
The Europa Park, namesake for the Europa Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announced, members and annual pass holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains glowed red and white that day through the jerseys.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park, it was shown again how well the partnership fits.
Seeing glowing fans having fun on the roller coaster confirms this, says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not as originally 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "At home"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "At Home" on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note and also served as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the noises on her front door at night.
I filled out the contact form to return an article yesterday, but did not receive an email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be whether my request has been answered.
Not everyone has the time for your clumsy chat and cheap goods from China.
Their mistake, which you correct and not all from our budget.
Contact Frau #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We chatted about it yesterday and agreed that I would get an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a renewed order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return shipping label.
This email has not arrived yet.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an antisemite doesn't mean anything.
That's like when an AfD supporter says he's not against foreigners.
They both deny it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, just leave it completely.
Yeah, you're just as unserious as Kollegah.
Anyone who fundamentally questions evolution is simply lost.
Because of this, a God has set the whole thing in motion.
But if you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of view, the loupe should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aspheric-achromatic lens system allows you to use the microscope practically free of registration and color errors, even in the peripheral zone.
Frequently, magnifying glasses are marked with magnification.
However, these specifications only apply to exactly defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to take note of the information in the table "Technical Data" (See instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including impact hammers.
By applying an antireflex coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
Under ideal conditions of use - the loupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the attached user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: In the Krembz community, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations when selling Christmas trees.
In one case, a man even drove home without his partner because they could not agree.
He plants around 2000 of them every year.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
The pre-Christmas time always makes it a bit funny, he says.
And the coupon?
Otherwise, I'm a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now have to pay the full price.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like "Dreher," which doesn't sound nearly as appetizing.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fibre optic connection in the house for a couple of weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable WiFi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit without any problems, apart from a few glitches.
The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module connected to the FritzBox.
However, on the other DLan module, which sends the WiFi, not the full 500 arrive, but the further I get away from the module with the module, the fewer arrive (so use a power outlet that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet is now slower in the first floor with the new glass fiber connection (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similar losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with glass fibre?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really at my wit's end, which is why I created an account here.
Therefore, I would be all the more pleased about an answer.
When it is time to change the Giro account
Anyone who thought there would be peace in the Giro accounts now sees themselves deceived.
While many banks used the autumn to get customers to confirm past fee increases with all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are also falling further.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now they have halved the tax-free allowance and even quadrupled it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the group's Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for current accounts and investment accounts, and to 25,000 euros for day-to-day accounts.
However, these lower fees now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already been reduced to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the ceiling for fees in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
Nevertheless: according to figures from the internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now offer a fee-free allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda Bank Berlin also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, a legal dispute with the consumer centers is still ongoing there, and in first instance, the regional court in Berlin even ruled in their favor with regard to this regulation.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutes should possibly form reserves - just in case the higher authorities declare negative interest rates to be fundamentally unallowable and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.
The table for 8 people was delivered instead of the table for 6 people.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a mountain and valley.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who made headlines in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An army of assistants, stylists and trainers are responsible for her appearance.
Nevertheless, so Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, read correctly: one single chip from the bag).
The fact that she manages to win the hearts of female and male fans alike is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with love - and is still looking for the great love.
And the baby wish was removed from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to hope that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end to a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight touch of the band, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo during not even half of the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" is ending his career in the motorsport royal class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates for the farewell.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the world championship in 2007 in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th world cup victory - Nolte wins two-man bob - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
I've worked it out, I'd have to win nine and a half races per season - then maybe I could make it to Cortina in 2026, said the double Olympic champion from the BSC Oberbärenburg, who notched up two wins in two days at the Winterberg races.
On Saturday, he fended off an attack by Johannes Lochner by five hundredths of a second, moving up from third place to first.
Then he changed something in the material set-up and drove out in front on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team, Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bau (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) beat the Brit Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded, said Friedrich, who also scored his 22nd victory in a row.
The Berchtesgaden native Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth this time after finishing second in the previous race.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after ranking fourth in the first race.
If I knew what he did differently, I would do it too, said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Among women, Laura Nolte won the third victory of the season in the two-woman bob on her home track.
After only managing fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to victory at the world cup with her brake woman Deborah Levi on Sunday.
Two-man Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she achieved her first podium finish this winter.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki came in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
It was super cool for me to get the first podium in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is taking me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and stressed: "It's not just about pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not quite flawless runs, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!
What should I do?
I did not receive it and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked about it.
Thanks to Corona, I had totally different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that it had expired, which made me very angry.
The chat was about the Asare armchair.
I want to return it and then order it again, since it is currently on sale.
Why is the shipping only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time
No, only when I click on it does an extra field with the message appear
Was taken yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged one
And not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear wonderful girls and women,
I've got a few things I want to write and perhaps it's the same for one - or the other...
I'm 24, have a part-time job, am a full-time student, and am a dog mom—apart from the fact that my dog doesn't cry or go to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (we've been together since 6th grade) is ill, has a second-degree burn from Monday, and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because his hand is in a cast due to burns).
He is also cold and we see each other less (1-2 times a week) which is causing me problems with my needs for affection and love.
My dog has just had an upset stomach, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and stroked him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we also have household chores to do, which we of course share.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My post-traumatic stress disorder is just about under control, I'm halfway through my treatment and I'm getting there.
Not good, but I get by and am almost symptom-free.
My university demands a lot from me right now (for me), tomorrow at 3 p.m. I have a written test for which I have done nothing, and anatomy class overmorrow for which I should at least have prepared something.
And next week I've got an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no space left.
My week is going like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental touchstones, because otherwise I'd go nuts.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it any other way...
Is it the same for you?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I can't put into words how truly grateful I am.
I don't know if I would have survived otherwise.
I think that has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I'd find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you a relaxing evening anyway, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately, the whole thing is a different color and the surface is scratched and the tabletop has a print.
The color of the first delivery was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or what?
The email to cancel was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In addition, twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
Mal was completely different: back then, at school, I realised that many religious education teachers did not believe in God, and for them it was just another subject like maths or geography.
For me that was always something strange, perhaps also because I was brought up Christian and I always somehow believed it.
How do you feel about it?
Maybe you can also tell from colleagues at work or study with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional, and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a syllabus, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes someone want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Culture or something else?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?
That's been going on for a long time, so I would avoid that
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response as soon as possible, at the latest by early next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I believe it was a film for young people.
In the film there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite certain).
Since I can't describe it any closer in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, their paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that he can live himself.
The transition is also the grave of the soldier.
In the end, both soldiers fight against each other.
If this says something to you, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has only slept on her stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
So a child holds out much more than one thinks.
Make sure that everything around it is right, no cuddly toys, go in more often and look, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and us never had a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Is it possible to stand up from the stomach?
Or is it with the face down in the mattress?
You can derive from this whether everything is in order.
We've all grown up too, and when my husband was born, it was common to put babies to sleep on their stomachs.
In addition, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought many articles.
But why are you only offering me 20 euros?
Hello, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received a reply.
It is about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently not usable.
To put it quite clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
But it is simply the case that the politics of this broadcaster are now under all sorts of pressure.
Every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that they were an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: "One doesn't want to be a running water column."
What are you now?
An 0815 advertising transmitter that is trying to get its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, this applies to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, people may continue to insult them.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and is trying to make ashes at the expense of the action with the rented rooms that have exploded.
How do you find all this good?
Toll if you like it, I find it terrible.
I ask for a recall, as my delivered wooden table is defective.
Corpus breakdown due to damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or simply for cuddling, my little warm friend is versatile.
Horse chestnut pillows are a traditional home remedy for warming applications, as horse chestnuts absorb heat very well and can release it in a controlled way.
The removable inner cushion is very easy to warm up in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft material makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry kernel pillow with cover is only suitable as a heat pad for the following applications:
Before warming up the kiss, check for untypical smell, stock or burn spots and dispose of it immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover to warm it up!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 Watt for max. 2 minutes (comply with the microwave manufacturer's instructions!)
Directly after heating, the heat is evenly distributed in the cushion by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first heating, a slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, which disappears with repeated applications.
Please adhere to the given heating instructions, as longer periods or higher performance levels can lead to damage (fire and burn hazard!).
Check before heating in the microwave that heating grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the warmed inner cushion has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion on your wrist for suitability for babies (max. 43°C)!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory complaints, fresh haematoma, bleeding and open wounds and in people with reduced pain perception.
In the case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases, as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels have come out, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and inaccessibly for children.
If the product is applied to babies under 1 year, the temperature of the child should be regularly monitored during application to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after the first half - Pauli wins in Dusseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
Ingolstadt is also not running smoothly under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover about interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20Q and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone is enough for operation.
Error message, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the plugged-in power supply.
I then took out the battery, but that didn't help either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in online mode?
Is something else broken?
Many thanks for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
The 20-litre container can also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stowed away using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need for everyday items remains well organised and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is also presented in a new look.
The trendy, minimalist design has a reputation for being just that - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to photo equipment.
This works with two options: conventionally via the cover flap, which can be locked with the MagLatch locking system, a brilliantly conceived solution for effective protection that has already been proven in the Messenger Bags.
In the locking clasp there is a metal locking hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the rucksack.
In contrast to most rucksacks, Peak Design has thought about various "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be hammered.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Flaps and hooks are also magnetic.
The backpack can also be reliably closed without the hook.
The second possibility also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: in addition to the cover flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday usability of the rucksack enormously: if you are not only taking your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior to your liking (more on that below) and thus store both separately and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, for example, while the everyday items stay safely in the left backpack half and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable shoulder straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the rucksack is also completely made from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents stay dry even if it's going to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.
Yesterday, #NAME# sent me an email confirming the appointment of
Contact has been made by the freight company to pick up the wrongly delivered table.
So far, I have not received any news.
I ask for immediate processing.
I am now writing to the third support employee. With none of them did I get further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
It is the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
When could the wardrobe be delivered again?
It is not an option for me to keep him...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
Have a nice evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will place a larger order at once, but at any rate I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And I had no idea that last year was going to be different from what I had planned, so I couldn't anticipate it and couldn't clarify it in time.
But the damage I suffered as a customer, I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking, even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made from castings and then mechanically worked (drilled and cut).
All ground glasses are manufactured in short series according to individual technical properties, which are typical for certain glasses and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which focuses on the cutting of the disc according to the properties of the original assembly.
The tinted glass thus produced ensures high comfort and brake efficiency.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the notches improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tinted glass underline the character of each car with an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing fragments in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" in 1849.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels arose almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer, searching for wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your pioneer colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to manage your resources, and set up a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your board allow you to be more efficient, gain additional actions, or apply rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold in Coloma was discovered), to 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can carry out actions.
Then their selection is unveiled and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lockdown!
This deactivates half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns to carry out actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning gunfighters.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The announcer turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and changes the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, so that each location has been hidden once and the year has ended.
There is a shootout where players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive smaller rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is determined.
The player with the most victory points wins!

Why children are not tyrants Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it immediately.
The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and holds lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he triggered a fierce debate about education.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is difficult to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
It must never, never, never be about power over the child for parents and other carers.
Our goal must always be to give the child room to develop and to make the framework for the child as large as it is meaningful and possible in the situation.
Brrr, it still shakes me.
Holetschek: Countries are advising on the removal of the obligation to take a test for those who have been vaccinated three times
State health ministers want to reach a decision at their next meeting about a nationwide lifting of the testing obligation for those who have been vaccinated three times.
We need clarity quickly from the federal states as to whether three-time vaccinees are exempt from testing, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the health ministers' conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The removal of 2G plus for triple vaccination is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional booster shot," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will already make a proposal to the health ministers' conference next Tuesday". - afp

How do I do that best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer process any purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Anzeige: Ups, there was an error.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated my account data.
What can this be due to?
What you describe is called *awareness*, that is, sensory perceptions under full anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
It is most common to hear noises/voices, less common to see pictures, and the least common to feel pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that go hand in hand with an increased rate of awareness, since to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut, a very deep anesthetic is avoided.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine describes Awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex by definition had none.
I misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros don't help either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation and is standard practice in e-commerce.
Please check again if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I sent you an email that you did not answer.
The question again.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The courier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
He told me they only deliver to the front door because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I must cancel the order, as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture upstairs.
Will I not be called?
I had formulated a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has profiled himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
The new book is still lying on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older."
The shocking diary of a slow goodbye to the world, which theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby express my lifelong thanks."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used as load carriers in the European region.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value amounted to a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not recorded
New York wins MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.
After a 1:1 tie in regular time against hosts Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final in a penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York defeated Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had received many great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
There was one at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and creamy!
Also thank you again :)
Now I've got a taste for it and want to cook roulade for the first time for New Year's Eve.
I will set up a beef fund tomorrow.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
What now?
What about the books? How do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I can live with that
IEs is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was informed by email on 18 January that the refund had been made.
But so far the money has not come to me.
Could you please check that?
Where there are still Christmas roasts in Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts.
Did you not get any chicken?
Now the time is tight.
We tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube output stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor switch.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level as well as the amount of distortion for your sound.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL regulator, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything in the "gain" and distortion.
Further up, it has already been stated that the POWER LEVEL regulator can even be used to call up a performance reserve if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulator so that even when using headphones or recording directly, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX jack, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you add a VFS5 footswitch, you can also call up the sounds conveniently by foot, switch in the effect blocks, and control the speed of the correspondingly compatible effects "tapping".
This is actually indispensable for live deployment.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But others had seen it too.
Is it then possible for you to send the lamp back?
Because it is too low over the table?
I would also like to send them back.
Can you help me further?
And the wardrobe?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work, I'd be happy with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need are a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) at the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worth it
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreement
According to Iran, progress is being made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear deal.
Both sides are about to agree on the topics that should be on the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development," as initially there had not even been agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement had continued after almost a week of interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France, and Russia are participating in the talks.
A US delegation is also in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen overtakes Saxony - Freistaat is now a federal state with the highest Corona incidence
Thüringen has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thüringen was above the mark of 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thüringen had fallen slightly, but had also exceeded 1000.
In Thüringen, 2,242 new cases of infection with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 seriously ill Covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be delays in registration on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and are barely keeping up with the capture of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery only takes place at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and hand it in at the post office, right?
Do I have to do anything else here?
That is precisely what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
In my opinion, an 8-euro return fee is an outrage.
It is time for change
Greetings from the Bundestag, I am a member of the European Parliament in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why the post here?
If you take a look at the activity of the Bundestag in recent months, you can see one thing: It does not exist.
We are in a winter rut and have extended the summer hole for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was it about?
For the most part, this is simply due to dissatisfaction, how some things have turned out and how we are generally doing.
In recent days, the impression has grown that many people here still want to go to the Bundestag.
What we need to change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is asked which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who noticed this project in the last few days and simply found a pile of garbage.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have been found who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would like to call on everyone again to participate, only then can this project exist in the future.
We have set up a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas and work out concrete details.
You can access the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the Bundestag function in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we appear externally in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair election system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot some things, but that's not so bad, we have the Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to Discord, work with us, and let's decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade for you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, since the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: is the day cover #PRS_ORG# also available in oversize, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must guarantee to me that the faulty wardrobe will be collected promptly.
And I ask you to do so now.
I don't have any suitable packaging, but I will take the shelf apart as much as possible for collection - they will need to sort out with #PRS_ORG# how this is going to work.
Anyone can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there an installation guide?
How long do I have to take care of these or decide to send them back?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself lived as a vegetarian for a while and currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian for several years.
When asked whether I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly, without having to think much about it.
And that I long thought that as a vegetarian I would be supporting animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to go vegan.
At the moment I had the impression that displeasure was arising on her side. She then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian, one reduces animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "blunt"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, one is quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise that one would not want to have.
It is greeted by a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is not an exception according to section 312d BGB.
Their #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be able to pick up my return on the date assigned by #PRS_ORG#.
Since I cannot be there for a funeral, that unfortunately cannot be changed either.
Could you please assign me an alternative pick-up date?
As of 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for water rescue is equipped: 45,000 euro subsidy from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz presented a donation certificate for €45,000 for the new water rescue vehicle of the volunteer fire brigade of Lahnstein in the town hall of Lahnstein.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to €135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they carry out tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they are permanently expecting increasing call-outs: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, I followed their recommendations and synchronized, removed and reloaded the app NICHTS has worked.
I am a little frustrated because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and I am now hoping for help.
Okay, so it is.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the previously mentioned values were determined in the Fenix Labor at 21°C ± 3°C, 50% - 80% relative humidity and the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.

Thanks first of all for the fact that you stand up for this whole thing, I've also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar activity, so we were also armed escorts in the executive, I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, one should say that the civil servant comes rather from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, it should also be clear to everyone that these people, in their uniforms and armed with weapons, should be attractive to right-wing conservatives. It should also be clear that these people then have difficulty dealing with reality, of course, because you have the average white person, now many Germans of migrant background, women, and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine stereotype, because there are fewer of those in the executive branch, and in fact, I'm talking about normal men and women who one doesn't notice if they don't tell you, and also to these people I must turn to for help, because in the end, they'll save your life or put theirs on the line for you.
But these fringe groups also represent, in my experience, a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel that they are rather less disadvantaged by exaggeratedly left-wing policies, even if these policies are supposedly for their benefit or supposedly do them justice, they just want to be treated normally.
Back to rights, of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, so you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but the idea that they are allowed to say their opinion there, or even brew up some subversive plans, is completely exaggerated by the media and annoys me too.
Of course, it also happens that police officers and soldiers, who were often on duty abroad, start to stereotype due to negative experiences and say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that like-minded people meet who carry out a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, such a thing is in my opinion well combated and also set against with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so intertwined internationally and that is a good thing, in my opinion, that we could not afford proper racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand, I have also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered it in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I have previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black could be delivered to Germany, or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I only find you as a partner company.
but on the edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves, which were filled with something yellow
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself
Ordinary through child?
Hello, me (w32) has been busy for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, so I have little leisure time), but for as long as I can remember, I have struggled to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything stays the same, and then and again it gets me and I clean up and tidy up.
But it is actually never so "that someone could visit spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly the household budget just loses against work and laziness.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become decent with children?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it and this question has been bothering me for a while.
Because for me there's no incentive, it simply doesn't bother me, as long as no one comes to visit and, for example, there's always fresh clothes there and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a greater incentive with children or do you stay lazy?
Looking forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a personality disorder?
I have completed a training course in software development and have been working as a software developer for about a year.
Unfortunately, however, I notice more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting again and studying social work for some time.
The problem: I have a self-doubting (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (AVPS).
This means, roughly speaking, that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it's very hard for me to conduct loose conversations and I've been told many times that I come across as unapproachable (which I've gotten better at).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth club, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family support.
But I don't know if the actual working day is really as I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find anything about it online.
The AVPS is already causing me problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it brings me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("just the simplest things go wrong") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know better by now" / "I hold them up with my stupid questions" / "he must think I'm poorly paid" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession, but I wanted to mention it here.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pick-up date
What do you mean by giving back, please?
If I download a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message comes I #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Is there a problem?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein in the food is broken down in the bird's gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and the bird uses these to build its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
Feather formation in the nestling and feather reformation in the maturing bird are extremely complex processes and are particularly demanding for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON Bio should not be administered during breeding, as this can lead to disruptions in the breeding process.
After this brief gift of NEKTON Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A spoon with 1 g NEKTON-Bio (inlay) corresponds to a cleaned measuring spoon.
In cases of severe feather damage, double or triple the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the approach to feather regeneration is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose will be given until the feather regrowth is completely finished.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without exposure to sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and attached pictures.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community employee in contradiction to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
Also Fällantrag an die Gemeinde gestellt.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus the walnut is not part of the statute.
However, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree in the statute.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
I thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher then?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket sent to Germany
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a severe traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
As the police press release currently states (2:03 p.m.), a passenger car came into the oncoming lane while overtaking.
There are injured.
Okay, I understand.
OK, then thank you again that it was so easy!
Rat and ideas for further career life
First happy Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately only moderately good, because my dear head is currently thinking about everything that can be thought about.
Before I digress here... in short: I need advice and preferably from people who know something about my situation - so from you.
I'm doing the ref as a rookie.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked in a field there (to remain at least somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything more specific).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I started looking for something more fun.
At some point I landed in teaching and was sure that was what I wanted - even if the conditions were more rigid than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I am now at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the past, I always decided to carry on and at least finish the ref, and then I could still make a U-turn.
But I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely drained.
Now it's the holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the whistle, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my evening my evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in the moment.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that make me even more nervous.
In principle, it's fun, and seen from the outside, the replay also runs well, which is also good for the feedback and so on.
But I'm completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already.
I wonder whether I want to have that for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions - or whether I should not go back to the old area, where I was valued, I was able to take free time when I needed it, although the work was somehow boring, but I was fairly paid and we worked as a team on something we had achieved, not as a single fighter like it is the case most of the time now.
But then I ask myself if I won't be in the same place again in a year and be dissatisfied.
You realize that it is all somehow confusing, but maybe you, as an outsider, can give advice or ideas of how I can get out of this situation, which I am completely finished and start crying at the smallest thought of it.
I'm not going to make any emotional decisions now; that will probably lead to nothing good.
But perhaps your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone of me.
I hope that my situation is at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has steadily evolved, which has led to the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly simulates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X, VT40X, and VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand-new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers are absolutely impressive in their authenticity.
These amps, too, of course contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analogue circuits, because these get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit design, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just bubble up.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level, until the amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined numerous times to satisfy new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will strike gold.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the end stage in particular determines the tube characteristics of an amplifier, and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuitry of each VT+ amplifier is equipped with a 12AX7 tube, which perfectly recreates the behaviour, subtle nuances and sound characteristics of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable hook-and-loop fastener sections, it is completely adjustable to your photo equipment needs and is suitable for all types of cameras – from compact system cameras of all sizes to full-format SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible configuration could be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three changeable lenses, and a detachable flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can also store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use the rucksack for your equipment and for foreign things.

Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is now the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists did not dare to make any predictions about when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree-hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1,200 hectares were covered by a one-meter-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new peninsulas with a total area of around 50 hectares have emerged off the coast as a result of cooled lava.
The banana industry, which is of immense importance for the island and on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was particularly affected. The industry was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and other areas were heavily affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is approaching and the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional events that still bring our increasingly divided society together.
Therefore, it is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a "peace-conferring "social contract of primitive peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became Christkind
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas days with gift giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day in one way or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as the bishop of Myra, threw gold through the window of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving gifts led to the popular German custom of filling children's boots with presents.
Protestants object to this practice because they reject the idea of intermediaries between God and man as "saint worship."
For these reasons, they are opposed to the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christkind out of Nikolaus and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer pay such close attention to these details, it bothers only a small number that the tradition of St. Nicholas is still as firmly established as the Martinmas tradition with Martinmas singing and the Martinmas procession in the run-up to Christmas.
Today one finds in boots by the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches everything that the heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was moved to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, a joyful muddle reigns over the question of who will now bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who is in principle a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been attributed over time.
These include his white, curly beard, which is only distantly related to the stern Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the presents, while in Russia it was Father Frost who became famous.
Here it is not cattle, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the homeland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite wars, the Christ child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the palace
A man armed with a knife was shot dead by police near the Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who allegedly entered a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was stopped by officials a short time later.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

The decorative light fits harmoniously into every bed, garden area or rock garden.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with two ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Light duration max. 10 hours.
The robust plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally in bright colors.
In contrast, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light glows fascinatingly – optionally in white or coloured light (in six different colour tones).
The seamless, amorphous design is deliberate: like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic rounded shapes fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can hold his own thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparation work: "Smart Stone" solar lights do not need a power supply or batteries.
Place the "glowing stone" on any sunlit spot.
Two supplied earth spikes provide a solid grip if required.
The matt white plastic housing itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module conceals "Smart Stone" discreetly in its interior, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white light, the other for coloured light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
As dusk falls, the "Smart Stone" begins to glow on its own; in which color, you decide: Six attractive light colors are available to you – in addition to daylight white.
It also switches off automatically when the battery charge drops to a predetermined minimum or when it gets light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the loading cycle starts the next day from the beginning.
I've done that several times and it doesn't work.
Shame, I would have liked to have ordered again from you, but if the voucher is not taken into account, I will not order again out of principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.

The motor control of the LokSound 5 was again fundamentally improved.
A variably adjustable PWM frequency of between 10,000 and 50,000 Hz ensures particularly quiet operation of gearmotors – the typical "buzzing" is now a thing of the past.
The load regulation can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows the automatic adjustment of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder supplies the motor with up to 1.5A of power, even for older motors.

Pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I'm doing this right, this is actually my first post on reddit after a year.
My problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had unbelievably bad cramps during my period and PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it at that, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I did not choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had an explosive outbreak of pimples, going from 0 to 100, during my two-year break and they were everywhere.
So superficially, but that has really stressed me and I did not feel well.
During the two-year break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid this.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without echo, but maybe someone can recommend something to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist did not take me seriously and the dermatologist's appointment is still pending.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, the skin is such a thing.
I had severe neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then large-scale acne.
I've also tried everything when it comes to nutrition in the course of my Christian illness, and I've remained on a sugar-, milk- and meat-poor mixed diet, because nothing else has really worked properly.
It can also be good that hormonally the worm is simply there, but if you, like me, have construction sites everywhere, you want to stop looking for what else is wrong.
I had already told her colleague semina o. ä.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concern.
I had to keep working and answering the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check when the money is there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong

In the name of the people: Laymen pass judgement
In the courtroom, they sit on the judge's bench in everyday clothes.
However, their verdict depends on many things, even if they are not wearing a robe: lay judges work together with professional judges to decide whether someone should be sent to prison, and for how long.
Two of them report about their time at the district court of Bad Kreuznach in a conversation with the "Oeffentlichen": Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the district court on the John-F.-Kennedy-Strasse.
Hello, unfortunately I cannot get into the customer account.

110 kV underground cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable near Tann is now final.
The resolution passed by the government of Lower Bavaria makes it possible to start construction in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning, near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in part with us.
The blue parcel number #PRS_ORG# with the order number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the remark "Delivery not possible".
The other three packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the further procedure is now?
A great start to the week!
You can forget that, I already explained that yesterday!
This is a glass cabinet, and all sides are broken, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken
The wardrobe is in my home and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into my home due to #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the wardrobe cannot be collected because no one is allowed to enter my apartment
Thank you for the message
But why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's in all books, that's why the request to #PRS_ORG#, because it is probably a general problem
Ref: Plan lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in the ref since the summer, teaching is fun for me, but at the moment I still have big problems planning my lessons in geography efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy in black and white, which is annoying for geography.
I currently need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, at the moment we are dealing with the topic of geofactors and with me, every hour is a topic in itself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I need that time for UBs, etc.).
I always start planning from the learning objective (what I want to achieve) and then consider how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied.
This is also the reason for the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
It would really make me happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to return the old one as soon as possible.
The trade fears for Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
Only those who have been vaccinated or recovered may enter most businesses.
The trade thinks this is unnecessary and complains about a drop in profits.
He also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations, from the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), are harming retail trade's important Christmas business.
Sales have slumped for non-essential items, HDE managing director Stefan Genth has criticised.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies viewed the remaining days of the year negatively.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
What should have been the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without a bottom, said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions therefore lost almost a third of their pre-crisis turnover in the past week.
Things are only going well in the grocery trade and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
2G when shopping does not get us any further in the fight against the pandemic, he emphasized.
The current regulations scared customers away and required a high level of human resources.
The bandage regulation must be allowed nationwide, he demanded.
Afterwards, every customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all businesses on that day with the received band.
In addition, in retail, as in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested), sample checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company specializing in shopping centers, Deutsche Euroshop, also reported a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies are currently at around 75 percent of their pre-corona level without 2G, and at around 90 percent in terms of turnover.
These figures will certainly fall in the run-up to Christmas," said chief executive Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, the centers are trying to find solutions and get approval.
This also includes the so-called wristband solution, where "visitors, for example, once prove their identity in a central location in the center, and then - equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel - can enter all the shops without being disturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and the frame also has a defect that was attempted to be covered with a yellow filler.
That looks bad.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it shut.
What do I have to do now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
The color temperature and brightness of the lamp are set by a modern microprocessor with extraordinary features.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set the color temperature in the range of 3100 to 5650K and save it.
Use the current settings in the flash storage.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to use.
The lamp generates a very high light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120-degree beam angle, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
Incidentally, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
They can adjust the brightness almost without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work with both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the light to be remotely controlled in television studios or when the light is mounted in difficult-to-access places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery)
User storage The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, simply press one of the storage buttons for longer and you're done.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the familiar situation is restored - Very practical in studio work, for example, when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 Functionality is derived from the possibility of operating with economical NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can fall back on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before use whether the batteries have enough performance - it has a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments a value is shown in the two display screens (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlight with power continuously via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm hose for fixing, so you can attach it directly to your tripod.
The inclination is reliably set using a stop on both sides.
It was taken into account that the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a swivel joint is included in the delivery.
Great is also the fact that a bag is included in the delivery.
This way you can safely transport or store the light and all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Shame, I got that as a gift and it's too small :(
The party we wanted to throw away: Frankfurt celebrates comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction by Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had lost their last two games, were apparently on the way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then SGE got going, blew off their frustration over a shaky season start within a good hour and won furiously with 5:2. It is crazy what the boys have achieved today, cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and addressed "a general round of applause to everyone who was there."
This initially looked like another setback for Frankfurt, who are now on rank nine and still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen the lead with 2:0.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
As the players came back and showed a fantastic performance, Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we showed and of course also with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was back on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and overcoming his muscle injury, also stressed the moral of his teammates.
I think our mentality is incredible, said the 27-year-old and enjoyed the result, especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, for the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, and feels well-prepared in terms of personnel.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are in a top physical condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live a highly professional life.
Now they want to "proceed step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks until the turn of the year "at this level".
Next up on Wednesday in the course of the English week is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6.30 p.m., Sky).
I get the mail that my package is coming back due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and divert it, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and the order is cancelled again?
Unfortunately, that would mean for me that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women before quarter final against Spain
Germany's handball women slunk off the court with drooping heads and empty eyes after their defeat to Denmark.
At the end of the main round of the World Championship, the DHB selection suffered a bitter defeat at 16-32 (8-13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and will now face hosts Spain in the quarter final.
We were too afraid and had too much respect for our opponent, said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to play differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game that we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle to reach the semi-final, a clear improvement is needed against the 2019 World Championship runner-up next Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German scorer in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defense, admitted back player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We must now look to the future quickly."
From front to back not on the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the height at the start.
Missed passes and technical errors in the attack and holes in the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully finished a fast counterattack.
However, the hoped-for initial ignition was not this.
The German women had little chance against the aggressive coverage of the Danes - and when they did, they usually failed because of the strong Althea Reinhardt in goal for the Scandinavians.
The game was over early at 3-10 in the 20th minute, especially since back player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later due to a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, however, she may participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection play somewhat better and at least got five goals by the break.
Even the faint hope of a catch-up after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9-19.
The Green Party protégés sinned in every area and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who counts among the medal candidates in the finals.
As a result, the German team was unable to rally for better performance and went down as a clear loser.
DACH Advent calendar day 6: Family traditions at Christmas
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have caught St. Nicholas's Day and take this as an opportunity to devote ourselves to family traditions in the pre-Christmas period, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve and the Christmas holidays.
What was it like at home back then?
Like your partner?
Do you also want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the most beautiful for the children?
The Stiefelputzen?
Gingerbread?
Christmas decorations?
Will it be played?
Is Santa Claus coming, the Christ child, or is the present from grandma and grandpa?
It doesn't matter how you do it, everyone makes an effort to have it as nice as possible as a family around Christmas.
Is it now a fixed tradition, or even something different every year? Tell us how it works in your family!
Please send me any transaction number... or anything else that could help
Transfer confirmation... etc
I would like to receive a voucher code.
just like at #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Does that work for them?
The title gives away that I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is used, primarily in care homes.
Since these will soon be finished for the most part, I will then go to vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organisational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not related to a personal matter (e.g. "I take medication X, is that compatible with the vaccination...").
In my area of responsibility falls the enlightenment for vaccination, the indication for vaccination (the person is entitled to a vaccination according to the vaccination order and does not have any reasons against it), the medical documentation and possibly the emergency treatment in case of allergic reactions (this has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often don't have any with us, but only (please don't take this as a lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, who, however, cannot carry out vaccinations (are not allowed to?), so I carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Serious "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television programme "Wir in Bayern" has caused serious thought.
But unlike on many previous days, the term "Host mi?" was not guessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "nervous man".
And no-one who "has to have everything done quickly".
That, the people heard from the TV presenter, is completely wrong.
The solution was announced by the man from Amberg and caused surprise with many people from Upper Palatinate.
The spectators learned that "Der Huidlerer" is a rag, with which someone wipes the stove.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typically Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the rather well-known dialect word "Houdern".
A skills gap has been closed - probably also for many who have lived in the Amberg region for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted, connected, synchronized and repaired the #PRS_ORG#.
Nothing helped.
Is choosing the right tires for your racing bike really that easy?
This morning, I woke up full of energy because I wanted to do some training for my bike tour next week at least.
Said, done, and I drove off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then this happened, which is what awaits you in every city centre (this time: thanks, Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud squeaking and my rear wheel did not want to take part in the rest of the track under any circumstances.
Since I had no real possibility because of the weekday to get hold of a replacement cape and replacement hose, I had to turn around half-heartedly and take the first train home.
Then it wasn't quite so bad for fun, maybe it's better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike tour.
But now I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long stretch over several days ahead of me, I would not like to have this problem more often.
It wasn't so bad now, since the old tyres from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had ridden 120km the day before I picked up the bike!) were also rather suboptimal, since he had ridden on them for many years.
But if I think that I have to change a tire after 80-90 km of driving, then I am really in a bad mood:D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me why I did not have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unplattable.
It all sounds very tempting now.
But are they really so indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed later.
I also ask myself: at the moment I think I'm doing 25 x 622 on the track bike.
There are also (apparently?) at the Marathon Plus tires, but most of it is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend other tires for a racing bike?
The swallow side seems to be my absolute favorite! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and loving greetings!
Car slams into tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had collided with a traffic island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for unclear reasons and then drove onto the wrong side of the road, according to police.
There was a head-on collision with a car driven by a 27-year-old.
The man's car was then hurled into a tree and the man trapped inside.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the publication of our new high-end broadband B 100 - 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would be expanded again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offshoot and is optically reminiscent of the big role models with the B 200 - 6 ohms.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitably designed foot that is integrated to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length accordingly to the conditions at home.
Principally, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume is not of utmost importance, but who want to achieve an extraordinarily high level of sound.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of generating such high sound pressure levels unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it is impressively mature and, for its size, extremely impressive and accurate.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight rise in pitch.
This is a common practice with broadband in general in order to optimise the increasing bundling at too high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is aimed exactly at the listening position and convinces with very clear and fine sound.
The high-frequency range can be reduced slightly to warm up the sound image.
Thanks to the point sound source, the localization of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is razor sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference-suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an enemy dynamics that is looking for its equal.
The SOLO 15 thus not only supplements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our construction kits, it is recommended to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning, in order to plan any changes to the construction.
If you want to veneer the housing, the speaker must be lowered accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
After all the plates have been cut to size (e.g. at a home improvement store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floorboard at the corresponding point, so that the cable can be passed through easily later.
With the help of an upper molding, the speaker opening in the front is now followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be mounted flush later.
The back should be equipped with a 45° phase to design the opening area of the speaker chassis as large as possible.
The four connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
Afterwards, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of them.
These are now glued to the back, the lid, the front and the floor.
The three reinforcements should also be installed and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in thickness as required, for example by using ready-made profiles from the DIY store instead of making your own from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be attached.
Afterwards, all the plates of the foot follow, that is, both sides and the front.
By using an appropriate hole saw or a forestry drill, the installation of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connecting clamp on the back wall, is facilitated.
Afterwards, one uses a round saw to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the foot plate can also be rounded off.
Afterwards, the base plate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
The next step is to mark and pre-drill (2.5 mm drill) the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connector clamp.
After the casing has been cleaned of wood dust (sucking / blowing), one begins to lay the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
In doing so, the entire and uncut cable is pushed through the 8 mm drilling in the foot, piece by piece, until the terminal opening, and is left to protrude there by around 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, one leads the cable to the speaker opening and lets it hang loosely there as well.
Next, the frequency switch is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Installation instructions Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency switch is built in and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
With the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and a bit of skill, you can drip hot glue onto the opening and seal it shut.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the seal accordingly.
Now follows the dampening, according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and fastened with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the plus pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to a length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and pushed in.
To dampen, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I cancel an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will also organize the OSCAST this year!
It is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio for known reasons, which has meant a higher level of planning and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people present at the switch, so that we can follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still the pandemic - yet we will give everything to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Put drinks on ice, plan some good food, and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
