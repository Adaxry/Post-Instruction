The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG customer and therefore it is no problem for me.
All I need is a number or instruction as to what I should put in the package so that it can be tracked back to you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG a few days ago... for 249 euros.
Today, it costs 179 euros.
I find this honestly very annoying.
Must I cancel the order and place a new order for the better price or is there another way to get a refund?
In principle, I also think that children should not be made to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it's good for big brothers to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Look for a moment, help for a moment, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they are still themselves enough children, I see no problem.
If your K1 is occupied for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best assess yourself whether this is suitable for your children.
It is not so that he should wrap K2 and accompany him to sleep for hours.
It is probably legally questionable.
Perhaps this is why the psychologist's statement.
Because if something actually happens like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk that you want to take is of course your decision ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title will never come to me, perhaps someone here knows ...
The story was about fear and how to deal with it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by drowning himself in food and going into his predatory cats' enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who after a short investigation goes to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and goes to this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of the suicide and document it and post the photos online.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist is running a kind of underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the patient's brain that suppresses an anxiety centre in the brain and the patients end up facing their anxiety to the extreme.
A woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to death.
This is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that caught fire.
That is so the rough action I am sure that the book was written by a French author / author.
If this action is known to anyone or even to me, I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the Wi-Fi password.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that can take time.
What steps should I take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the fingernail

They have tried to pull him with a tweezers.
Very difficult to handle.
Did not work and caused damage.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try it.
No chance anymore.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to promote revaccination
New Omikron cases concern politics and science in Great Britain.
Therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive an offer for vaccination by New Year.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move even faster than before in the Corona revaccinations in the face of rapidly rising Omega numbers.
Every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots on Sunday evening.
Until now, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to speed up the vaccination campaigns in the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish regions.
Johnson said that in the face of the Omikron variant, the vaccination protection must be strengthened urgently.
The good news is that the protection level can be raised again with a third vaccination.
“Let's boost now!", Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 additional Omikron cases were registered in Great Britain, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

I am in favor of everyone using pronouns
I have sent an application.
Today, the invitation to a conversation came by mail.
I want to respond to the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him/her and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how I should write the e-mail now.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm an immigrant and I don't want to step on anyone's toes.
Conclusion: Everyone should present themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
4 of them go.
The only thing I bought today does not work
Obviously, the chair had an invisible defect in sales.
How can such a mattress damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Only on the #PRS_ORG tries.
But this has been working since about
14 days no longer.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I would like to add 2 chairs to the order and bill you for it.
The feeling of not being able to help.
Content warning: I will write something more detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something from the soul.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really touches me and unfortunately occurs far too often is that many victims do not allow themselves to be helped or think we could not help them.
It is clear to me that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the confused eyes...
But even in a conversation among four people, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing, I cannot reach everyone.
I do not know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from this.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, even very close to tears myself, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it will never be easier.
Please always keep in mind that it is worth living without violence, that is so important.
“Arcane” on Netflix: What does the series have to do with “League of Legends”?

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least Johannes Patrick, a youngster, was expelled.
Again nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick said to the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have something in our stomach."
But after the game, she did not lay it down - but rather increased it again in the face of the 61:72 (28: 38) - defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
However, more than just the bare result disappointed.
Representative is a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point percentage was just 13 percent, 4 shots (all by young Johannes Patrick) at 31 attempts - any questions?
The response came from John Patrick: "We were not concentrated enough after the victory in Tenerife and did not implement what we trained."
That is, to move the ball.
Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently to his counterpart: "A great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
It felt like being in front of 10,000 people.
On Saturday, only 750 spectators were allowed into the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their own expense.
Not least due to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered his team's game.
“The best playmaker I have ever trained”, praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team itself the performance leaders like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed throughout the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) prevented the giants from a total debacle and came up to eight points after they were already 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
Fortunately, there is plenty of time for whining.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg up to 750 spectators.
We used to have another email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already reported.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves legally again and have written to them again.
We had already reported half a year ago.
Always like out of the egg: Max Raabe will be 59
He manages to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
At the moment, he is on the road with the program "Good morning, dear happiness" - if he should appear.
In fact, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of that.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on the order of the authorities" to contain the Corona virus.
Even other of his planned performances in Advent have to be postponed, as it says on the website of the singer, who is 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
In January, the artists then want to catch up with their already postponed 2020 dates due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and a lot since his youth.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, together with his fellow students, he founded the Palace Orchestra.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his success album "For Women, This is Not a Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has brought it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blond hair strictly combed back and mindful of labels, Max Raabe from the current German-speaking music scene cannot be ignored.
Since 2020, he has been on tour with the program "Good morning, dear happiness". dpa

Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Through expropriation, no new apartment is created
The new Federal Minister of Construction and Housing, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as it was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
In an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday), Geywitz said: "With an expropriation, no new apartments are created, only the owner structure changes."
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will be affordable in the next few years.
In addition, a mixture of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition wants to set up an expert commission to deal with the result of the referendum.
But if the situation does not calm down, Geywitz is holding talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a restriction of rent increases in tight housing markets and an expansion of the rental market.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax despite this, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 dead in tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have torn through the USA.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be mourned.
The pictures remind of a war zone.
In the night from Saturday to Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe destruction in the USA and possibly claimed up to 100 deaths.
The storms leave a roughly 320-kilometer-long trail of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
The governor of Kentucky, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everything was gone everywhere the tornado had passed.
Houses, businesses, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial plants and roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that this is even possible.
He calculates alone in the state of Kentucky with up to 100 dead, the official figures are updated hourly.
Hello, I just saw that the #NAME vitrine is sold out.
That is very bad.
Is it still produced?
Or is she completely out of stock?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
until when do you report?
If delivery cannot be made to my home, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I now order the ceiling and deliver it to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned the contact form or returned it and wanted to inquire whether it arrived or was processed, as I had not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees money for vaccination.
With this, they are on the same line as the social partners ÖGB and Economic Chamber, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - after the German example - is intended to increase the willingness to Corona vaccinations.
He has changed jobs in a company where he has worked.
This does not make his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It has been a year.
He has obviously not stuck to his old place and has been looking for something else.
You should also do that.
And that he did not like you at that time: well, no matter.
He did not find his job well.
There are too many variables.
Please cancel the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.

Help with first own campaign
Boron to the rescue!
I am currently leading a group of 4 friends on the adventure "Over the cliff pass" and would like to lead my heroes seamlessly into a specially written campaign for players.
We play DSA 5.
The great arc is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts devised and now I am writing the introductory adventure and stumble already at the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a wagon with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
That is where the further action will develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to lure the heroes into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: Convince, act, threaten, recognize the danger early on, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords
The goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a hollow way and flank the wagon with spears, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and are healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
2. If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf with two of his knights jumps in and helps the heroes in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything is super.
How appropriate is your Deus ex Machina of solution 2?
Is the encounter too much of an adventure?
The group Goblins will later play a decisive role, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I did not expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will implement many of your ideas and now I also have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And back together again.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That's why I would like to send her back
Can you then come back, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG.

I am fed up with Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more throughout the season, so I want to take a little breath with this post.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 pre-reporting punctually.
Although the delayed start and the start accident delayed the time plan far behind the planning, but you could still show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it is the case that, for legal reasons, F1 enjoys priority and therefore everything else must be restricted so that Sky DE had no choice here.
Nevertheless, stupid, as Sky UK is broadcasting the race.
However, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was rule ignorance among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of whom did not know that you have to change the tires under a red flag.
Although there was this situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen should change the tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that Verstappen had this opportunity.
I am of the opinion that such elementary rules should be known if one is commenting on a pay-TV F1.
It is also not the first puzzle race, which is now according to the rules possible or prescribed, both have simply constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
In general, the artificial commentary style of Roos does not appeal to him, but he concedes that it is a matter of taste.
But I even like Heiko Wasser from RTL seriously.
In addition, there are constant idiocies, which both simply appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee for the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" of Ralf Schumacher.
The last one brings a lot of confusion into the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-up, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, where only the German audio track without commentary is available directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two broadcasters also make less advertising in the training than Sky, and as a free TV broadcaster.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not make me forget the disadvantages.
The rest of the program of Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky really is the worst German-language broadcaster of Formula 1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races it is allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be with a reasonable sender.
I would be interested in your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should have been delivered last week and is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an e-mail and she has never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the material has a hole at the front of the chair).
I ask for support.
Air pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system with an air pump.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
There you can compare the performances.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run an entire plant with them.
If one has a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that more than one outlet can be connected.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, but the pump also offers the opportunity to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or something similar.
The MK series has a special, soundproof construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The blower pump is connected via an air hose 4/6 mm to an exhaust valve ... and it's already ready to go.
The blower pump should be the same, or higher than the water level and be installed outside.
If the blower pump is lower than the water level, one should put a check valve in between.
Just cut through the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent if the water were to run backwards, which the water from the tank would run through the pump...
If the blower pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps.
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we here in eBay indicate the processing time with 3 days, the packages are packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily.
If everything is going well, it goes very fast.
We just want to take a little precaution so that no one is offended just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics sector...of course, no Corona here.
Please do not rate immediately bad, just because the delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the postal service.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment that...they have it really hard
This is also very different regionally.
Be good to no one, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order yellow with and without armrests?
Is it possible to order the legs in white here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the western US state of Texas.
Under a radiant blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the freshly cut astronauts after their return.
“Welcome back”, said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the astronaut Alan Shepard, who flew into space in 1961 (1923-1998), and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company. The other four passengers paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their tickets, Blue Origin did not reveal.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered the mission of her father after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Even Michael Strahan expressed himself enthusiastically.
He would most like to go back to space again, said the moderator.
New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometers
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automatically.
The capsule separated from the rocket reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the earth, temporarily with zero gravity, before the reusable object was braked by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned flight of Blue Origin: In July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and a 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was there, who became famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works or studies biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject itself quite exciting and I am not bothered in the lab (I have already completed the organic chemistry practical).
Of course, I have also already informed myself about career prospects before studying. But I also thought at the time that I definitely want to study until my PhD.
But at the moment I have doubts, especially because of the job prospects.
On the one side (Studycheck etc) one always hears super career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other side one always hears of unemployed biologists and incredibly badly paid jobs.
That would really interest me:
1) What are you working on at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What have you studied/What training have you made?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
At the moment, I am really unsure and am considering breaking off my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as a computer specialist.
If you have any experiences, please write them down :)
Extra stress before holidays and weekends
This topic came up last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why now a post is there.
Not only before big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, is there a lot of stress in the company.
As it seems, there is also before the holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the feast of the Assumption, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and companies make a bridge day, which is semi-official.
There was therefore a long 4-day weekend in the house last week.
What happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
According to e-mails that had to be sent immediately before departure, orders here, orders there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because "next week then" after so much time should not be?
Or because people really want to do as much as possible in a short week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also powerfully irritated.
What is this self-sacrifice for holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we don't really like them?!
The stress was not noted down from above, the colleagues were all quite independent.
My question is simply: Are we the only Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no presents yet.
The beautiful, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you just go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will participate in the festival by baking and decorating cookies with her son.
I love it, said Catterfeld.
Until the reflective days, however, there was still a lot to clear up: "For the first time I had no presents, I have to finally let go."
NEKTON Bio supports a friction-free operation of the Mauser and the feather renewal.
NEKTON Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
Most of the feather damage occurring in aviculture is due to feeding errors.
Since the feathers consist of protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during the moult are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply with vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the application of NEKTON Bio, no further vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered through drinking water or feed.
Thank you, I have found it
Unfortunately, it still does not work
DDR Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Saxony and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably came from the conversion proposal of the model railway enthusiast ME Heft 11/1968. Used with traces of play and parts missing, see photos, Functions well, The E 95 series is a heavy goods train electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also came from the small series manufacturer ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and is operational
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that was to be able to pull 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this line.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
Therefore, the DRG decided in March 1926 to deliver as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with tapered drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as war reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk in Dessau, all six locomotives were examined.
As a result of the increasing electrification of the middle German network, a growing demand for locomotives for heavy goods traffic emerged. In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled, and the remaining machines served as spare parts suppliers.
In the first place, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were preferred.
It was not until the E 94 could be seen that the processing number could not be further increased that the E 95 came into focus for processing.
First, the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway workshop.
They came to the railway workshop Halle P in 1960.
They were usually used in their own timetable in front of coal trains from Geiseltal to Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
It was often the case that Schütze remained stuck during health checks.
Then the constantly accompanying fireman with hammer and wooden block had to release the shutter during the ride.
Damage to the traction motors occurred more frequently and led to months of downtime for the locomotive.
Since there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and an expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn could dispense with old locomotives and most splinter gattries, so that the E 95 was taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to staff its electric locomotives with only one man, which would have been a problem due to the difficulties with the machines and the view from the driver's cab.
After mid-1969, the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn, followed by the E 95 01, which retired on 5 October 1970.
The intended new name 255 001 was never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 at the main station in Halle.
It took some time for those responsible at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external processing of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle exhibition in the RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive was completed.
The DB Museum in Halle (Saale) is taking care of the locomotive in a museum.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditional Community Bw Halle P have been working on the operationally ready processing of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with a new internal and external painting, where the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves on the basis of their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the middle German network.
The main focus was initially on Silesia

However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately defective.
The middle beam does not fit into the intended holding.
I also get new ones.

House fire with two light injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in an apartment building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-figure euro area has been caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (district Landsberg am Lech).
According to the information, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The precise cause of the fire was initially not known, but the police did not rule out arson.
The Criminal Police Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
But that comes later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
In order to defuse fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend prompted him to do so, said Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz Biontech company, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
In the social media there were false information that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," wrote Sahin on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
“For some time now, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated to counteract these false rumors”.
So far, he has rejected it because the communication should not revolve around him himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 infection and has been hooked up to a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, wrote Şahin further.
He did not ask for reasons.
The most frequent cause, however, appears to be fear, which is often caused by false information and mistrust.
It is difficult to fight fear with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
“At the moment, it is not legally possible for me to get the vaccine myself,” said Şahin at the time.
There is a prioritization of vaccination in Germany.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has long been forgotten - and the biontech boss has been vaccinated three times, according to his own information.
Fire in substation: Ten thousand people without power
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more power and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without power for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities.
The power supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power units were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disturbance was finally completely repaired late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered places of care in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked the affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their untiring commitment," said the head of the primary technology sector, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage would still take a few days, as the Westnetz workers could only put some lines back into operation provisionally at first, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect caused the fire.
Electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at 7.15 pm in the substation Neunkirchen-Seelscheid has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear.
There, extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had power again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were switched on gradually from 21.30.
Since 11.15 p.m., the last affected by the outage have also had power.
More than 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
After the development of a power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighborhood assistance.
“It is now important that citizens in their neighborhood take care of older or alone people and inform the local fire brigade equipment house when help is needed”, explained district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The focus was on the residents of nursing homes when setting up and operating emergency power units.
In addition, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical equipment or were dependent on medical care.
Good morning!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day and stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount it under the tabletop.
It is a Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions.
We wanted those with tabletops with a diameter of #NUMBER
We got 155cm diameter.
Today, my #PRS_ORG came, but I can't push it together and therefore shorten it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back, since they are not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
I would be glad to receive feedback
Yes, that is really easier!
Then we do it!
Do you send me the return receipt by mail?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG# before the purchase.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low discount almost unbelievable.
We are not in agreement with that
Nordic Combination: Combiner Riiber wins

Return of the contract number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both updated and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have already heard of the problem
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG, it seems to be there too.
Sobal I want to open it, ups!
This document cannot be opened.
The file may be faulty and report an error to the customer service.
As far as I can see, it is a #PRS_ORG epub file.
Can they help me further?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I also have to work in between!
In order for the paint to be applied evenly and cleanly, you should clean the parts with some soap water to remove dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the no longer visible inner side of the parts or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Draw even strokes next to each other.
Light overlapping of the color layers later leads to a uniform surface.
Avoid fast wiping with the brush.
This leads to unrealistic-looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones could otherwise appear later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come to an end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, there can be ugly metal streaks when they mix with normal colors.
Leave the painted parts to dry for a day before installing them.
The models achieve an authentic appearance through decals or stickers.
From coats of arms on aircraft to ship names to decorations on automobiles: The decals give the model the last touch.
Bring the decals in the right order, as long as the parts are still accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be / can be covered before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool like scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are the right time, patience and a calm hand.
Cut each required decal individually and place it correctly.
Decals are also called water transfer pictures, because you briefly moisten the back of the sticker with water until the carrier paper is darkened by the moisture.
Then you push the picture just a little bit from the paper and put it on the corresponding place on the model (which you have also previously moistened).
While you attach the decal to the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper to the side.
Attention: Always check if the picture is in the right place before removing it completely from the paper, so that it does not stick, knit or even tear.
Draining excess water with a household rag.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time, as soon as I look for something else, I no longer read the book and have to log out and log in and load the book again and find the place where I have read.
On Saturday, I have already communicated with you.
Will I get this by email?
Even for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 separate packages
Thank you anyway!
Then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But will I get it back without any problems?
Pregnancy treatment in PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
We were in fertility treatment for a while, but now, when it comes to dealing with the PKV, this suddenly comes to a standstill.
One after the other:
We had applied for the children's wish fulfillment in advance with the PKV and received the promise of three attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. temporal framework, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was deducted from the PKV.
A little later, we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but these were not counted with the PKV.
We again applied for the costs to be taken over by the PKV and were again given 3 more attempts.
After a few more trials (we have conducted more trials than promised, logically the most expensive with the PKV), we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2 + 3), the PKV will only pay for 3 trials.
The justification: With pregnancy/birth, the other 2 tests of the first promise are lost.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, however, "the insurance case begins with the treatment and ends when the treatment no longer requires treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
Who has the right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be reimbursed) or us (it is 5 attempts to reimburse)?
Did the PKV have to point out to us in the contract that further attempts would fail with a birth?
Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Could you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can reach them best again
In order.
We will no longer order anything from them.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
They would like to pass it on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was triggered and now you say I have to send it back.
I can't do anything about the fact that the cabinet is completely destroyed at me
Please see what the colleague wrote in the screenshot
It is clear and clear that the repayment was triggered and I have not yet received any repayment via #PRS_ORG
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We will no longer do this.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they cannot sell him as an office chair.
Independent of this, the guarantee of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good morning, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG
These products are advertised with additional purchasing hooks, which we unfortunately cannot find with you.
Can they help?
The topic of the week: The best low-budget films
What a low-budget film is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia says the following:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding by a major film studio or private investor.
On the Internet, there are plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What annoys you?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, I have already furnished two apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to know the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Many thanks
With friendly greetings
There is no telephone number, a chat, where one has to wait 30 minutes, is no chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I give up then, because it simply doesn't work here.
Hello
“Half Victory” against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation sustainably, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This suspended state - Belarus does not give up completely, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while longer.
The handling of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, ruled Bossong.
Apparently, there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Because the EU as a whole is not committed to this, it will cost the fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens the cohesion in the Union.
“She can apparently not prevail if a member state decides to do its own thing,” such as Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU pays a further price for its policy on the border with Belarus, says Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Attempt to cross the border again
According to Polish border guards, migrants have once again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
A spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday that 55 migrants had been arrested overnight on Sunday and returned to the border.
Polish officials have been pelted with stones near Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border protection registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border controls.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of Minsk of being a ruler who attracted her with the prospect of travel to the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to countries of origin to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU reaction is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
“The EU has thrown its market power into the scales and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions”.
Minsk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly pushes thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The silver arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is based on a supposed violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is alleged to have overtaken illegally.
A second appeal was lodged against the final rating.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had come to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase, during which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I check it.
I speak with the bank and register myself again with you
thanks for the support
Free entry for members: Europa-Park organizes SC Freiburg Fantag
The Europa-Park, named after the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
According to the park, members and permanent card holders of the Sport Club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community could visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coasters were lit up in red and white on this day.
The fox, Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," the park said.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it has once again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is the €#Number# and not originally 1699€?

Judith Hermann reads from her novel "Home"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord" on Friday, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" in the sold-out Blue Note and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the noises at her front door at night.
I handed in the contact form for the return of an article yesterday, but I did not receive an email confirmation or something similar.
My question would be whether my question has been answered.
Not everyone has the time for your cluttered chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Her mistake, which she repairs and not all from our household.
Contact Frau #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We watched yesterday and agreed that I or #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a repeat order of the #PRS_ORG #night table and a return label.
This e-mail has not yet arrived.
The package wants to bring #PRS_ORG today.

However, these data only apply to exactly defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the operating conditions.
In order to use your Lupe optimally, please note the technical data in the table (see instructions in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including impact lenses - light reflections are created.
Through an antireflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
If the optimal use conditions are stopped - Lupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions (available in German and English).

Whether as a reading aid on the go or simply for the everyday little things: The Zeiss VisuCard is the ideal helper, as it can be taken everywhere thanks to its handy format.
And her hard shell makes her robust against special strains in old age.
For each loupe there is a cardboard sleeve for storage and safe transport.
They offer these parts, which you can see in the pictures or under "What do you offer?"

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations in the sale of timber.
Once, a man even drove home without his partner because they could not agree.
He plants there every year about 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas time a bit fun, he says.
And the coupon?
Otherwise, am I a customer?!
At least I have received a defect delivery and now I have paid the full price.
Then I will also evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which is far from appetizing.
Problems with glass fibre + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass fibre connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems setting up a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which has worked flawlessly for 50 Mbit reception and transmission.
The new fiber-optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, as well.
However, on the other DLan module, which transmits Wi-Fi, no longer comes the full 500, but the further I move away from the module with the module, the less I get (so I use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber-optic connection is now even slower than before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than the DLan, there were also large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is "lost" over the power line with glass fibers?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really at a loss, so I created an extra account here.
That's why I would be so happy about an answer.
When it's time to change the savings account
Who thought that now there would be calm at the Giro accounts, is deceived.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the fee increases of the past once again with various tricks from their customers, the negative interest rates are also falling further.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the free bet and even quartered the daily bonus.
In a first step, the border was only lowered for customers of the subsidiary Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current accounts and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for overnight accounts.
However, these lower free bets now apply to the entire German Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly struck individual agreements with established customers".
The Commerzbank had already come down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as is the case with ING Germany.
The popular direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has now lowered the bonus to 25,000 euros.
Nevertheless: More than 100 banks have after numbers of the Internet portal Verivox so far a bonus of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance even received a ruling from the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should form reserves - in the event that even the highest courts declare the negative interest rates in principle unlawful and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.
The table for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people.
The undercarriage is that for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially part of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For them, who made a sensation with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" in 2021, this success is first and foremost the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers is concerned about her appearance.
After all, as Aniston says, she allows herself a chip a day (yes, really: a single chip from the bag).
That your hearts are equally attracted to the female and male fans is actually a miracle.
Perhaps because they are simply unlucky - and still looking for the great love.
And has deleted the baby wish from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked about it had no idea what was going on with me personally, medically, why I couldn't.
It was really offensive.
Hope that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönens departure from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight contact with the tires, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after only half the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport royal class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates for the farewell.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins two-man bob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
“I have calculated it once, I would have to win nine and a half races per season, then I could do it until Cortina 2026”, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who won two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
He only defended the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths on Saturday, driving from third place to first.
Then he changed something in the material setting and pulled out a larger lead on Sunday.
With his team, Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Baur (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the Briton Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We took a greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also scored his 22nd consecutive victory.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving to Stuttgart this time, came in fifth.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed after fourth place in the first race on eighth place.
If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do the same, said Lochner.
Nolte with Heimsieg - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won her third win of the season in the two-woman bob.
After her fourth place in the monobob on the previous day, she raced with pusher Deborah Levi to the World Cup victory on Sunday.
Two-bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she scored her first podium place this winter.
Wiesbadenerin Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig on third place.
For me it was supercool to be the first podium place in the World Cup, I am superhappy that Mariama is with me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay," said Burghardt and stressed: "It is not just pushing, but there is also a lot to do around there."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not quite error-free trips, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the ceiling in my shopping cart and could now buy it!
What should I do?
I have not received him and therefore could not release him, so I finally asked.
Last year, through Corona, I had completely different problems and never had time for that.
And now it was said that it had run out, which made me very angry.
Look at the chat, it was about the Asare chair.
I want to return it and then order it again, since it is currently on sale.
Why will the delivery only start on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Your colleague took it yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we want the cabinet module anyway, just a new undamaged
And not the entire order is canceled.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write about and maybe it goes for others too...
I am 24, I have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mama - apart from the fact that my dog does not scream or goes to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has taken a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him. We cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him wash (because his hand is in a cast due to burns).
On top of that, he is cold and we see each other less (1-2x a week) at the moment, which makes me very concerned about my needs for affection and love.
My puppy is suffering from stomach pain, I have cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was with the heater and stroking him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now we also have to do housework, which we of course share.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just right at the moment, I'm halfway through therapy and I'm getting better.
Not good, but I get there and am almost symptom-free.
My university demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I have never done anything and tomorrow anatomy lesson for which I at least should have prepared something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what then comes is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room there.
So goes my week: Just until tomorrow, then the weekend.
But then everything goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental stopping points because otherwise I'll just go crazy.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do anything else...
Is it the same for you?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I do not have to work.
Really endlessly grateful, I can't put it into words.
I do not know whether I have survived my kptbs.
I think that has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find suffering comrades here...
I wish you at least a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
Unfortunately, I received my order today, but the whole other color plus surface is scratched and the table leg has a print.
In the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In addition, twice.
But it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I discovered in school that many religion teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, this was always something strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed.
How do you stand to that?
Perhaps you can also tell stories from work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would be odd to have a physics teacher who does not believe in relativity theory.
What makes one want to teach religion if one does not believe?
Maintaining culture or so?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?Write in English, I understand that too
That's already very long, then I would turn away
That's okay.
I expected an early response at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film Search Help Please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I believe it was a film for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead).
Since I cannot describe it any closer in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Flight of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that he can live himself.
I think the transition is also the soldier's grave.
At the end, I think both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If this says something to you, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has only slept on her back from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child holds much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything is in order around there, no stuffed animals, more often go in and out and look, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
And ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Observe your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it rise from the stomach?
Or is it with the face in front of the mattress?
You can deduce from that whether everything is in order.
We are also all grown up and when my husband came into the world, it was a piece of cake to put the kids on the belly to sleep.
In addition, we are already "Stammkunde" with you and have already bought many articles
But why do you only offer me 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no response.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID #).
The right drawer does not fit into the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not currently in use.
To put it quite clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this sender is currently under fire.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but at the same time go on a big tour.
It was said that one was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: Man wants to be "no running newspaper stand".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertiser who tries to bring his billmerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
The of course apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they will continue to offend people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ashes out of exploded rooms at the expense of the action.
How do you find all this?
If it suits you, I find it terrible.
I ask for a recall, since my delivered wooden table is defective.
Corpus fracture due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG.
Whether as a comforter for stomach pain or just for cuddling - my little warm friend is versatile and can be used in many ways.
Kirschkern pillows are a traditional household remedy for soothing warmth applications, as cherries are very good at absorbing and releasing heat.
The removable inner cushion can be heated very easily in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft connection makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel secure, even if it does not always go well.
The Kirschkern pillow with connection is suitable exclusively for the following applications:
Before the heating of the kiss on an untypical smell, stock or burn marks, check and immediately dispose of.
Please take out the inner cushion before heating!
In the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (information from the microwave manufacturer).
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the blanket by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back into place.
In the first heating, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, which disappears with repeated use.
Please adhere strictly to the given heating instructions, as longer periods or higher energy levels can lead to damage (fire and combustion danger!).
Before heating the kiss in the microwave, check that heating of grain products in the manufacturer's instructions is allowed.
After the heated inner cushion was put back into place, please check the temperature of the kiss on suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your arm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, blood clots and open wounds and for people with reduced pain sensitivity.
For existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases and pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores have come out, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessibly for children.
If the product is applied to babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be regularly controlled during application to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents occurring in connection with the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority in the country where the user is located.
The connection is detachable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of a return to the Bundesliga.
In the meantime, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
For Ingolstadt, it also does not run under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the fine game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed start under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20Q and about 3 years old) could no longer be charged through my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the battery alone was enough for operation.
Complaint, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start anymore despite being plugged in.
Then I expanded the battery, but nothing happened.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop online?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I do not know how high the seat surface is.....
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design no problem!
20 liters of capacity can also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely mounted using the padded FlexFold parts.
And what you need for everyday objects is well organized and separable from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design has it in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some of the most innovative solutions to protect the interior of the rucksack reliably and yet provide access to the photo equipment in a second.
This works with two options: either conventionally via the cover flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, a thoroughly thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in the messenger bags.
In addition, there is a metal latch in the closure with matching anchor bolts on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most rucksacks, Peak Design has taken various "filling levels" into account: there are four anchor bolts, welded solid, into which the closure hook can be inserted.
If the backpack is fully loaded, take the top bar, if it's empty, take the lower one.
Flaps and hooks are also magnetic.
The rucksack can also be reliably closed without fastening the hook.
The second option distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other, photo backpacks: in addition to the flap closure, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional rucksacks with access from above - you no longer have to wade through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the practicality of the rucksack enorm: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or travel luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more about this below) and so easily separate the two - and through the two side openings also independently access them.
In addition, you can pull the backpack from the right side out in front of the body to reach the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safely in the left backpack compartment and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help.
And since the outer shell of the rucksack is also completely made of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if it is going to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.
Yesterday, NAME sent me an email confirming the appointment
Notification of contact by the shipping company to pick up the wrongly delivered table.
So far, I have not received any message.
I ask for immediate settlement.
I am now writing with the third support employee, I got no further than the promise that I would receive an email as confirmation.
It is about the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
It is then to be seen when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him is not an option for me...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
I wish you a beautiful evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will immediately place a larger order, but I have kept the damaged furniture piece and not returned it.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected, I could not imagine and could not handle it in a timely manner.
But I do not accept the damage as a customer.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the requirements of the dynamic driver, who knows how to assess the reliability and safety of braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are cast and then mechanically processed (bored and cut).
All tinted windows are made in short series after individual technical properties, which are specific for certain windows and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created that is tailored to the extraction of the disc after the properties of the original assembly.
The resulting tuned plates ensure high comfort and brake effectiveness.
In addition, created openings increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, whereby the contacts improve the cleaning of brake discs and brake shoes.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned wheels underline the character of each car through attractive and eye-catching appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shiny rocks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were demarcated, tents were opened, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share of the wealth of the country.
For many, it was said: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who is looking for wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will be looking for gold, recruiting workers, breeding horses and building companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to surpass your pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategic game with many ways to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, you have to keep an eye on your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to be more efficient, to receive additional actions or to turn the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual game style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly choose a location on the game board where they can carry out actions.
After that, her selection is revealed and she places her pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates half of the site - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players alternately carry out actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, exploring rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolver heroes.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The initiator turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This goes on as long as the bidder has moved five times, i.e. has once hidden each location and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which players Coloma have to defend against an attack by enraged bandits.
If the players have supplied enough revolver heroes and the bandits are numerically superior, they are rewarded.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most points wins!
For free shipping, I take up to 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm the shipping form, goods shipment (games followed).

“Why children are not tyrants” Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it immediately.
The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and holds lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he triggered a heated debate on education.
Former patients and legal guardians now accuse him of serious offenses.
Please be careful, the film is difficult to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
It should never, never, never be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is possible and sensible in the given situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the abolition of the triple vaccination test
The health ministers of the federal states want to decide on a nationwide exemption from the triple vaccination at their next meeting.
We need clarity quickly, whether and from when for three times vaccinated the test obligation applies, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to Bild am Sonntag.
The withdrawal of 2G plus for triple vaccination is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional vaccine boost," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed to "make a proposal to the health ministers' conference next Tuesday." - AFP
So I want to send the lamp back
How do I get there best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I cannot see how high the seat surface is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer handle my #PRS_ORG purchases.
Complaint: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer.
I have updated my contact data.
Why is this the case?
What you describe will be called *Awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
It is most common to hear sounds/voices, rarely to see images, and almost never to feel pain.
Relevant for this topic: Kaiserschnitte are operations that go hand in hand with an increased rate of awareness, as one avoids deep anaesthesia to protect the child.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Specific anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment by me describes Awareness correctly, but Nitemarex **by definition had no.
I misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros do not help.
These are legal guarantees.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation also standard in the e-commerce sector.
Please check if they can at least take back the broken chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I sent you an email that you have not answered.
The question again.
In the order and on the invoice, the goods will be delivered to the room of my choice.
The shipper is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
Man told me that they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS_ORG.
Is that so?
If yes, I have to cancel the order, since I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Am I not called?
I had a question formulated
Theaterhistorian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has profiled himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading, the message arrives that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I'm already thanking my life here."
There are various types of palettes.
One of the most common is the European pallet, a standardized wooden pallet that is mainly used as a load carrier in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million palettes were produced in Austria in 2020.

Rouladen Tipps & Tricks
Last week I got many great tips for the perfect goulash.
There was it at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thanks again :)
Now I have tasted it and would like to cook my first roulade on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a cattle fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
What happens now?
What is with the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I get used to it
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But so far the money has not gone to me.
Would you please check that.
Where there are still Christmas roasts in Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck belongs to the Christmas holidays like the fir tree and presents.
They have not yet been concerned about poultry?
Now time is running out.
We tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a tube stage plays a major role in the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor Scheme.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-Regler, you can set both the desired level and the distortion of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL regulator that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "gain" and distortion.
Further up, it sounded as if you could even make a performance reserve with the POWER LEVEL regulator if it ever gets unruly loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so that you yourself get an "acoustic" sound impression when using headphones or direct recordings.
The AUX-jack can be connected to a CD or MP3 player, so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - you therefore do not need a separate tuner.
Those who have additionally purchased a VFS5 foot pedal can call up the sounds conveniently by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and tap the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live deployment.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But this was not the case with others.
Is it then possible to send the lamp back?
Because it is too low for an eating table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me further?
And the cabinet?
Will we get another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG chairs
If it does not work, I would be satisfied with a legacy or voucher.
Under the circumstances, I find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are something much.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG Spiegel (Door) at the intended hook.
This is not a satisfying answer and the waiting time has not paid off
Is there a premium customer status at you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
According to Iranian information, progress has been made in the negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
Ali Bagheri, Iran's chief negotiator, said on Sunday that both sides are close to agreeing on the issues that are on the agenda.
This is a "positive and important development," because initially there was no consensus on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the talks on the revival of the agreement had continued after nearly a week of interruption.
Representatives of Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest coronavirus incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia has exceeded 1000 cases of coronavirus infection on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always had the highest incidence nationwide, the value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but was also above 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths in connection with an infection were reported within a day.
200 seriously ill with Covid-19 were intensively treated in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health departments have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly able to keep up with the new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and send it to the post, right?
Here, do I have to do anything else?
Exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I write to you.
I would like to bear the return myself.
8 euro return fee is a cheekiness in my eyes.
It is time for changes
Dear Bundestag, I am here in the heart of Europe in the Plenarsaal on a fantastic day!
Why is the post here?
If one looks at the activity in the past few months of the Bundestag, one can say that it is not extinct.
We have come to a winter standstill and have extended the summer gap by a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what is it?
For the most part, this is simply due to dissatisfaction, as here some things have gone wrong and as we generally stand.
In the last few days, there has been a growing impression that many here are still really excited about the Bundestag.
What we have to change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is asking which of them wants to keep this alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, which has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found, simply put, a pile of shards.
After some back-and-forth writing, several people from the community have found that they want to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly appeal to everyone to get involved, only in this way can this project also have a future in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
How should the Bundestag work in the future?
Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we appear externally in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I am quite sure that I have forgotten something, but that's not so bad, we have the Discord at the end.
If you have the time and inclination, come to the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade for you, which will be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clumsy for my taste.
I have already ordered another suspension for you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, since the #NAME is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day cover #PRS_ORG, is it also available in large sizes, for example 240/240?
PRS_ORG must guarantee to me that the faulty cabinet will be removed as soon as possible.
And I beg you to do so now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will try to dismantle the cabinet as far as possible for collection - they must clarify with #PRS_ORG how this will work.
PRS_ORG can contact me by telephone at any time to arrange a collection date.
Is there an instruction for installation?
How long would I have to worry about these or decide to send them back?
Why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived as a vegetarian for a while, and eats meat very rarely at the moment.
I myself was also a vegetarian for a few years.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism a planned step, I answered honestly.
And that I thought for a long time that I would be supporting animal welfare as a vegetarian, but eventually realized that I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that she was irritated, she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian you could reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to "plump" was?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, one is quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise, without which one would not care.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;
It is clear that it is not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Their #PRS_ORG do not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not there on the specified date, when #PRS_ORG picks up my returns.
Unfortunately, I can't be there because of a funeral.
Could an alternative collection date be assigned to me, please?
I will be available again from 01.02.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for water rescue equipped: 45.000 euros subsidy from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatine Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, handed over a cheque for 45,000 euros for the new rescue vehicle of the voluntary fire brigade in Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total costs of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatine is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment vehicle is used by the diving team Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they fulfill tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one deals permanently with rising numbers: The boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure boat contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10%, and then the problems began.
I can't open the book.
However, I have followed her recommendations and synchronized, removed and reloaded the app NICHTS has worked.
I am a little frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, then.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# in June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the previously mentioned values ​​were determined at 21°C±3 °C, 50%-80% relative humidity and the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.

Thank you first of all for being here, I have also spent almost a decade in state service in a similar activity, we were also weapons carriers in the executive, I do not want to go any further!
The question of rights and lefts I always find very simplified.
Basically, one should say that of course the civil servant comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
That of course also applies to the special uniform and weapon bearer, that of course should also be clear to everyone that these people then of course have difficulty coping with the lived reality is of course also clear, because you have of course in addition to the average white, nowadays many Germans with migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and I now mean not the exaggeratedly feminine cliché Schwulen, because these exist in the executive rather less and not at all, but quite normal men and women to whom you do not notice when they do not tell you), and you can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they save your life or set this for you.
But even these fringe groups represent a conservative stance, in my experience, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel more alienated by over-the-top left-wing politics, even if this policy is supposed to benefit them or they feel they must be made to feel better.
Back to the rights, since of course the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but they should be allowed to say their opinions there or even to hatch state-threatening plans in the media.
Of course, it is not uncommon for police officers and soldiers who have often been on foreign missions to begin to generalize and sometimes say things that are controversial or even politically incorrect.
It is also possible that right-thinking comrades sometimes meet and engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, it is well combated and counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled and this is also good in my opinion that we could not possibly have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I do not understand, I have also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I have already ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I have previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, one could send the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER # Euro to Germany in black, or this basket is also available in Germany somewhere.
I always only see you as a partner company.
But on the edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves, which have been filled with something yellow
And on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Ordinary by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been occupied with this thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed and have very little free time), but I have always found it more difficult than right to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything is standing still, and then and when I pack.
But it is actually never the case that someone spontaneously drops by.
My husband (unfortunately) is also not better, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly the household loses against work and boredom.
The kitchen is still the most regularly cleaned because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to make your child orderly?
We have not yet, but we are working on it and this question has occupied me for a long time.
Because for me there is no incentive to do it, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as there is no visitor and always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen is usable.
Is it a greater incentive to have a child or do you remain sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and allows almost unrestricted freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with a personality disorder?
I have completed an education in the field of software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am more and more aware that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-sustaining (or anxiously avoiding) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
That means roughly that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a rational level, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have been told many times that I come across as unapproachable (which I think I have become better at).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth club, but rather in, for example, drug counselling or family support.
But I do not know whether the concrete working day really is like I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something about it on the Internet.
The AEVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("again, just the simplest things are broken") and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how this goes by now"/"I keep him busy with my stupid questions"/"he has to keep me busy" etc.).
I will probably have problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it at the place.
But have you recovered the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation.
I waited for a collection date
What do they want to give back, please!
If I have downloaded a book from the #PRS_ORG, the message does not appear on your #PRS_ORG authorized this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein taken in with the food (protein) is broken down in the bird's stomach-intestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and is then rebuilt into its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation of the nestling and the feather renewal of the molting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high demand for the total organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON Bio should not be administered during breeding, as this can lead to disruptions in the breeding process.
After this brief gift of NEKTON Bio, NEKTON S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON MSA (mineral preparation) should be returned to daily vitamin supply.

1 g NEKTON Bio on 250 ml water or 100 g feed.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/feed as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
A stained measuring spoon (inset) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON Bio.
In the case of strong feather damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON Bio can be given at the beginning, until the new feather growth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until feather formation is complete.
Storage: NEKTON Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break down after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement of a municipal employee in contradiction to the constitution
Hallo r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property, a walnut tree will be felled.
Fallantrag an die Gemeinde gestellt.
A colleague writes to me that the felling of fruit trees is not part of the regulations.
However, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protective tree in the bylaws.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the constitution is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a legacy or a voucher?
What was expensive?
Yes, I believe that, only the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the roof delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Emergency message: Serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the junction Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
According to the press alarm of the police (14:03), a car came into the oncoming traffic when overtaking.
There are injured.
Okay, I understand.
Good, then thank you again that it was so easy!
Counsel and ideas for further professional life
Happy Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is only moderately good, because my dear head is just destroying everything that can be destroyed.
Before I dive into this now, briefly: I need advice and best of all from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross-country skier.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in that area (at least a little anonymously, I will not name anything here).
But all this was too boring and I looked for alternatives that would be more fun.
At some point I landed in teaching and I was sure it was - even if the framework conditions are much less flexible than in my previous job, but that was not important to me.
I am now at the third "I google other places of employment."
And it is only half a year.
In the past, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ref. Afterwards, I can always change my mind.
But I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I completely emptied myself.
Now there are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the break, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my celebration my celebration.
There I was free.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in the moment.
Now the family celebration is too much stress.
And then there are these rigid structures that make me nervous.
In principle, it's fun and from the outside, it runs well, which is the feedback and so on.
But I am completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can handle before it completely shuts down - if it doesn't already do that.
I wonder whether I would have wanted this for the rest of my working life - just when I read some of your contributions here - or whether I should go back to the old area, where I was valued, where I was given free time when I needed it, and where the work was somehow boring but paid appropriately and where I worked as part of a team and not as an individual fighter like it is now most of the time.
But then I ask myself whether I will not be back at the same place a year from now and dissatisfied.
You notice that everything is somehow weird, but perhaps you have advice or ideas as an outsider, how I can get out of this situation, that I am completely finished and almost start crying at the smallest thought about it.
I will no longer make decisions emotionally, which is probably not a good thing.
But perhaps your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is already enough for me.
Thank you for reading and sorry for the whiny tone of me.
I hope that at least my situation has become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously developed, leading to the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X / VT40X / VT100X Amps, we present a brand-new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and Amp-Schaltungen, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix valve pre-amplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these simply capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only spurt out.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, until the amp and effects sound as you always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 presented VOX Valve Reactor Technology.
Naturally, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
The new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for a maximum sound variety will find it here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of dynamics and string attack and prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the end stage determines the tube characteristic of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor Technology based on this finding.
The 12AX7-tube-equipped Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier forms the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier perfectly.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The defeat series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to beat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main feature is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro closure parts, it is perfectly tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible stocking would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three changeable lenses and a pop-up flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
In addition, a lot of accessories can be installed.
And who has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for his equipment and for photo-unrelated things.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also a good choice for drone pilots, because the rucksack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: longest in history
Since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
Since Sunday, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was regarded as the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous eruptions.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists dared no forecast when it would end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Damages in millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000 degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 residential buildings and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Approximately 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
On the coast, two new landmasses were created by frozen lava with a total area of about 50 hectares.
The banana industry, which is of immense importance for the island, was particularly affected. About half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly from it, and it was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still unites our increasingly divided society.
The more important it is to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a "peace-making 'society contract of natural peoples' ", can again be filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days closely with the giving of presents.
Previously, gifts were presented on the one or other occasion.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw three women a bag of gold into their window at night to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional form of giving, the custom arose in Germany to fill shoes, especially with gifts, with children.
Protestants objected to this custom because they consider mediators between God and humans as "idolatry."
For these reasons, they defend the institution.
Martin Luther turned Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
Because most Protestants no longer see such detail questions so closely, it only irritates a few that the custom of Saint Nicholas is still as closely linked to Martinssinging and Martin's Procession as Martin's Day.
Today, one finds shoes in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of giving on the day of St. Nicholas since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was moved to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian-oriented countries, there is a merry hubbub about who now brings the presents to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas Man, who in principle is a kind of Nikolaus, appears.
This includes, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy, the witch Befana is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses pulling his sleigh.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.

Otherwise, buy another e-book #PRS_ORG#.
Last week and this morning I asked for a return envelope for my order #NUMBER.
I was told that something would be sent to me.
Since I have not received one yet (in the SPAM folder either), I wanted to ask how long this usually takes.
Many thanks.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near the King's Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police said that callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone into a bank and a bookmaker's office with a weapon.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was later stopped by officials.
There were shots and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene of the crime.
The police did not go from a terrorist background.
In the vicinity of Kensington Palace, several embassies are located.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
What then?
No matter where I click, I am immediately directed to your side.
The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or stone garden.
The light is simply installed and can be anchored with 2 earth spikes in the ground.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Light duration max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic production can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is harmless: The sun alone makes this solar light fascinating - either in white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The borderless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: As a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself at day.
His organic circles fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can rely on his size.
You can save a lot of preliminary work: As a solar lamp, "Smart Stone" requires neither connection nor batteries.
Set the "light stone" to a popular, sun-lit place.
Two provided earth spikes ensure firm hold when needed.
The white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides "Smart Stone" discreetly in his interior, together with his battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charged when sunlight falls on the case.
At twilight, "Smart Stone" begins to light up itself; you can choose the colour yourself: six attractive light colours are available to you - in addition to daylight white.
Finally, the shutdown occurs automatically as soon as the battery charge level drops to a predetermined minimum or it gets light again.
As soon as the sun reappears, the charging cycle begins the next day from scratch.
I have made it work several times.
Sadly, I would have liked to order further with you, but if the voucher is not credited, I will not order in principle.
If you have any other questions, please let me know.
Otherwise, this was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
In any case, no tree market has opened.....
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again.
A variable PWM frequency of 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a super-silent operation of gear motors - the typical "buzzing" belongs to the past.
The load regulation can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows automatic calibration of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 Decoder provides with up to 1.5A motor current enough juice even for older motors.

Pill Problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I do everything right here, is reddit actually my first post after a year?
My problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such terrible cramps during my period and shitty PMS before my period.
Now I would like to stay there, because I already take enough medication that I cannot choose myself.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten explosive pickles from 0 to 100 in my last approximately two-year break and these everywhere.
As far as so superficial, but it has really bothered me and I did not feel well.
In the two years of pause, it has never really normalized.
Perhaps someone has some tips on how to avoid this this time.
Perfume-free and without noise is my cosmetics, but perhaps someone can recommend something to me.
Gynaecologist has not taken me seriously and dermatologist appointment is still pending.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the lovely skin is such a thing.
If Vorbupertär had bad neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale knot fungus and the acne topic.
I have also tried everything in the field of nutrition in connection with the Christian disease and have remained on a sugar, milk and meat-free mishmash because nothing else really works so well.
It could also be that hormonally the worm is simply in there, but if you like me have a construction site everywhere, you'd rather not look for anything else.
I had already given everything to her colleague semina o. ä.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concern.
I always have to work in between and to the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money is there?
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong
but is there him in general
since he is available in black

In the name of the people: Laity pass judgement
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the judge's bench.
But much depends on their verdict, even if they are not wearing a robe: Judges decide with professional judges whether and for how long someone is behind bars.
Two of them report in conversation with the "public": Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I do not get into the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# to the email address above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no possibility to store these for such a long time.
We would use the table as if it were theirs
I had already ordered the same chair in November and received it. Therefore, because they are so beautiful, I now have one in gray.
Must the cabinet be completely dismantled for collection and restoration?
And where would the collection be?
110-kV-Erdkabel will 2022 neu gebaut
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The approval of the government of Lower Bavaria makes the way free for the construction, which is to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has now shared this.
The seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the transformer station Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a transmission tower near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.
The blue betting number #PRS_ORG# with the broadcast number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what happens now?
A beautiful start to the week!
You can forget that, can't you? I've explained that more than once yesterday!
This is a chest of drawers made of glass and all the sides are broken, so everywhere is glass and the cardboard is broken.
The cabinet is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment due to the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the cabinet cannot be removed because no one is allowed to enter my apartment
Thank you for the message
But why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER EUR
No, it is with all books, that's why the query at #PRS_ORG, because it is a general problem
Ref: Lesson planning (EK)
Hello dear colleagues and colleagues,
I have been in the Ref since the summer, teaching is fun, but at the moment I have big problems planning my lessons in geography.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so I can only use the table, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy s/w for free (which annoys geography).
I simply need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors, and for me, every hour counts.
In principle, the methods are repeated again and again, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple teaching hours (I also need time for UBs, etc.).
In the planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a work sheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
That is why the work sheets.
Perhaps I can work with the book like a geography teacher.
I would really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG from the order #NUMBER.
I have actually already decided for a new at #PRS_ORG, but I would like to deal with the returns as quickly as possible.
The trade fears for the Christmas business due to the 2G regulation.
In most businesses, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains about losses in turnover.
He also has a possible solution ready.
According to the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), the 2G regulations are destroying the important Christmas business for retailers.
At businesses with articles of non-daily need, losses in turnover are to be lamented, criticized HDE managing director Stefan Genth.
According to an up-to-date survey by the HDE among 1100 traders, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
“What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without bottom,” said Genth.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost a third of their pre-crisis turnover in the past week.
Only runs well in the food retail trade and online.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
“2G while shopping does not bring us further in the fight against the pandemic”, he stressed.
The current regulations frightened customers away and required high personnel expenditure.
The bandage regulation must be allowed nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all businesses with the received band.
In addition, in the retail trade - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - should be sufficient for random checks.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75 percent of the pre-corona level, with sales at around 90 percent.
These figures will now fall in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Because of the high personal and administrative expense, attempts are made to find solutions and obtain approval for the centers.
This includes the so-called bandage solution, in which "visitors, for example, can provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and then, equipped with a wristband like in a club hotel, can freely enter all businesses". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG.
The Spiegel has a scratch and the frame is also faulty, which is covered with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already put it back in the package and taped it.
How do I have to proceed now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD -LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
For the setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set the color temperature in the range of 3100-5650K and save it.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simply and intuitively usable.
The lamp generates a very high light current with soft light of high quality, completely free of flicker.
The emission angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distances, is excellent.
Incidentally, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
They can adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 -Controller allows remote control of the light in TV studios or if the light is mounted in difficult-to-access places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a lit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
In addition, there is the slot for the NP-F Akkus (not included in the delivery).
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to carry out the settings of the individual settings to the memory locations, simply by pressing one of the memory keys for a longer time.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120's functionality, thanks to the possibility of working with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can rely on already existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before setting whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery packs a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlights with power via the supplied network cable.
The development of the flashlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm hose for fixing, so you can connect directly to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set by means of sensors on both sides.
Attention was paid that the mechanical components are extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a swivel is included in the delivery.
The delivery also contains a bag.
So you can transport or store the light and all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Sadly, I got it and it's too small :(
We wanted to throw a party: Frankfurt celebrates after torrid comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, it seemed as if the last twice without a win in a row Hessen were on their way to the next Bundesliga collapse.
But then the SGE turned, shot the frustration over a mediocre start of the season from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It's madness what the guys have done today," jubilated coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke a "general praise to everyone who was there."
In the end, it looked like a dampener for the now ninth-ranked Frankfurt.
Patrik Schick had the Leverkuseners with 2:0 in the lead.
What then happened also impressed the SGE coach.
“How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance”, Glasner continued.
I am crazy happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth game and his overcame muscle injury, stressed the morale of his teammates.
“I believe our mentality is incredible,” said the 27-year-old and was particularly pleased with the result for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
But for the upcoming tasks, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also sees himself well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that all players are fit in December, that all players are physically in a top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live high professionally.
Now one wants to "continue step by step and remain modest" and deal with the tasks until the end of the year "on this level".
Next up is already on Wednesday in the course of the English week an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (8.30 pm, Sky).
I get the mail that my package is returned to you due to a mistake on my part.
I have tried to call #PRS_ORG# and redirect it, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is confirmed and the order is cancelled again?
Unfortunately, for me it would mean that I would no longer order because it has already taken a long time.
Have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG chairs?
Dampers for handball women before quarterfinal against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slink away after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes from the floor.
At the end of the main round of the World Championship, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat at 16:32 (8: 13) before 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face the hosts Spain in the quarter-finals.
We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent, said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It is a shame that we could not take the flow with us.
This was a bad game for all of us, which we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, there must be a clear increase against the world champion of 2019 on Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was setter Alina Grijseels with six goals.
We were simply not there - neither in the attack nor in the defense, said Xenia Smits and called for: "We have to look forward now."
From front to back not on the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on the height at the start.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on work temperature and prevented with a few parades worse.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
However, the hoped-for initial spark was not.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly set the scene - and when they did, they usually failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, as setter Mia Zschocke saw a red card for a hard foul on her opponent a little later.
But in the quarterfinals, she will have to work again.
Only in the final phase of the first half, the DHB selection came a little better into play and at least to five goals.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Green youngsters sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal candidates in the final round.
In the following, the German team could no longer catch up with a performance increase and went as a clear loser from the floor.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions in the Christmas season
In the context of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have caught the Nikolaustag and are taking this opportunity to devote ourselves to family traditions in the pre-Christmas period, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve and Christmas.
What was it like at home then?
How is your partner?
Do you also want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the best for the children?
The boot polishing?
Cookies?
Pest control?
Is music played?
Is Santa Claus, the Christ Child or is the gift from grandma and grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone makes an effort around Christmas to have it as a family as possible.
Whether this is a fixed tradition or even something different every year: tell us how it went in your family or how it will go!
Please send me any transaction number ... or anything else that could help
Transfer confirmation... etc
I would like to give a coupon code
as with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Do they do that?
The title exists, I am active as a vaccine in mobile vaccine teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered in nursing homes.
Since these are soon completed to a large extent, it goes on to a part in vaccination centers for me.
I answer questions without a time limit to the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, so long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, does that go with the vaccination...").
In my area of responsibility, I have to inform about the vaccination, the indication (the person has the right to be vaccinated according to the Corona vaccination regulations and no reasons speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency supply in case of allergic reactions (it has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccine teams, however, we often do not have pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, but "only" (God willing, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, which can not carry out (can they?) vaccinations, so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "hairy" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in from Amberg, there has been a lot of heated thinking in the BR television programme "We in Bavaria".
But unlike on many previous days, the term "Host me?" was unfamiliar to the callers this time.
No, it was not a "nervous person".
And no one, "who everything must go fast".
That, heard the people from the TV moderator, is completely wrong.
On which the man from Amberg communicated the solution and probably also caused astonishment among many Upper Palatines.
The "sweeper" is a rag that someone uses to clean the fireplace, the spectators were told.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatine term, derived somehow from the more well-known word "Houdern".
With which an education gap was closed - probably also for many who have been living in Amberg for a long time.
I can no longer buy books for two weeks.
After the confirmation, there is always the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing has helped.
Is the tire election really so safe?
Today I woke up full of energy because I at least wanted to train a little for my bicycle tour next week.
Said, done and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then that happened, which lurks in every inner city (this time: thanks Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud squeaking and my rear wheels definitely did not want to accompany the rest of the track.
Because I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and replacement hose on a weekday, I had to turn around half-heartedly and take the first train home.
Isn't it a bit funny, maybe it's even better if I practice changing the tires again before the bike tour.
But now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would not like to have this problem more often.
Now it really wasn't that bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, I picked up the bike at 14 o'clock on the day that I picked up the bike 120km worn out!) and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had been driving them for years.
But if I think that I have to change the tire after 80-90 km, then I really think I'm in a bad mood:D
Now I was talking to an older man at the platform, who wondered why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be unplatable.
Now, of course, it all sounds very attractive.
But are these really so indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40 euros/tire now, only to be disappointed in the end.
Furthermore, I ask myself: at the moment I believe I have 25x622.
There are also (apparently?) Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend other tires for a racing bike?
The swallow page seems to be my absolute! Laiewissen rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and greetings!

After the publication of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a question of time before our SOLO series would get new blood again.
SOLO 15 is the new offshoot and reminds optically of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM
However, in this construction proposal, a suitably designed foot is included to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted accordingly to the circumstances at home.
Principally, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum sound level plays a rather subordinate role in terms of sound quality, but an exceptionally high level of sound should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of generating nearly unfiltered large sound pressure levels.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she presents herself impressively mature and for her size extremely impressive and precise.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high tone increase.
This is generally the case with broadband networks to optimize the strong increase in bundling at high frequencies.
Exactly aimed at the listening place, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
The high-frequency range can be reduced slightly and so the sound image can be warmed up.
Thanks to the point-sound source, the location of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimal stereo triangle is extremely precise and surprisingly precise.
The suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM create an enemy dynamic that is looking for its equal.
The SOLO 15 not only supplements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our construction kits, it is advisable to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning, so that corresponding changes can be planned during construction.
For example, if you want to furnish the shell, the lowering of the speaker must be adapted accordingly, as the furniture adds material again.
After all the plates were cut (e.g. in the DIY store), the first thing to do was to drill an 8 mm hole in the floor plate at the appropriate place, so that the cable could be run through there later without any problems.
With the help of an upper friction, the speaker opening in the front is now followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
On the inside, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase to maximize the opening area of the speaker chassis.
The four connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
After that, you begin with the actual development of the box and place one of the two side walls in front of you.
These are now the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor.
In addition, the three reinforcements should be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in material thickness if, for example, you want to use prefabricated boards from the timber market instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be installed.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. both sides and the front.
Through the use of a suitable slot saw or Forstner drill, the installation of the openings of the bass reflex speaker, as well as the connection clamp on the rear wall, is facilitated.
Afterwards, a round sander is used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off.
Afterwards, the footplate is firmly glued to the shell and additionally screwed with long wood screws.
The following is the marking and drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connection clamps.
After the shell has been cleaned of wood dust (absorb / blow out), you begin to lay the cable.
This is easiest achieved through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
In this case, the entire and uncut cable is pushed through the 8 mm hole in the foot until the terminal opening and is left there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, one leads the cable to the speaker opening and lets it hang there loosely.
Subsequently, the frequency switch is prepared and used.
The construction plan for the frequency switch and the corresponding connection plan can be obtained from the following document: Installation instructions Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little skill, one can drizzle hot glue on the opening and close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, one can check the sealing accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and tightened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus lead (marked cable) must be connected to the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
At the end, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
The damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept open.
Can I cancel an order now and deliver it in early June?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will also hold the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of cancellation.
BUT: There will be at least three people involved, so that we can follow the Oscars 2021 with at least seven beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it is still a pandemic - nevertheless, we will do everything to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Have you ever cooled drinks, planned good food, and prepared yourself for a long but very interesting night?
