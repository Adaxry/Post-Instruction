Zhejiang University Art Festival Student Choir Leader Research Achievements Make People's Minds Open-Xinhuanet
Wash your hands with air, judge the disease, and search for the source of the mist yesterday evening at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year of Zhejiang University.
The main researchers of these results are students, and the research covers the fields of environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, and humanities education. Students started from a curious point and created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won national and international awards.
Biological sensor: Your family physician
The Biomedical Engineering Institute of Zhejiang University PhD student Zhang Dongyuan demonstrated a biological sensor at the scene, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
“All you need to do is breathe lightly, and this device can analyze the components of your breath to provide an initial assessment of your body's health."
Zhang Diqiang said that the sensor is connected to the smartphone, and when the gas is detected, the health report will be displayed on the smartphone.
Smart bracelets that can detect health conditions on the market generally test physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biological sensor uses a new type of material called silicone, and its target substance is a chemical element. Its "sense of smell" enables it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health condition.
Smart surgical light: doctor's high-powered magnifying glass
In addition to smartphones, the surgery room also uses smart surgical lights.
This invention won the silver medal at the 44th Invention Exhibition of the Republic of China (Taiwan) this year.
Optoelectronic Science and Engineering Institute undergraduate Zhu Linjing and Sennuo Fengtian team started a new way of thinking in the defects of traditional hand-held lamps, and invented the intelligent LED hand-held lamp.
“Many diseases are diagnosed and treated in the early stage, and the light used in the operating room of the doctors is related to it.
Sun Ruifeng said that in the early diagnosis of cancer, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor organizations in time, the cancer cells will also spread.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamps that adjust the light spectrum to enhance the differentiation of cells under light irradiation.
In the process of cosmetic surgery, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and transparency of light according to the cosmetic surgery needs and individual habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been used in the Shaoxing Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University, and other hospitals in Zhejiang University. It has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the National Invention Award, the first prize.
Wash your hands with air: the water is too hot
Ordinary people wash their hands by splashing water, rubbing soap, and pouring water, while Li Tianzhang and other students invented a "air washing device".
As long as we stand on the washing machine, our body weight can compress the air.
It is like a punching bag.
The compressed air is turned into a fluid and mixed with the water in the dragon's head.
In this way, we can clean our hands!"
The results of the experiment show that the effect of washing is the same as that of ordinary washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own weight as the driving force to ensure cleanliness, and can save up to 90% of water, and the whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention broke through many top universities in the world and won the only gold medal.
Please arrange to return to me as soon as possible, thank you.
Cancel the order and return the money, do not earn points, and you will not use #PRS_ORG# again!

Fortunately
It feels like a very important affidavit - emergency affidavit
This is one of the important skills certificates I have seen!
In addition, the emergency rescue measures are actually the emergency rescue at the time of the emergency rescue, that is, the rescue before the rescue.
It is well known that in the process of rescuing the ambulance after the accident, there was still a little time, and it was the most critical time.
At that time, it was an emergency rescue.
If I really have a heart disease, stroke, respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, golden four minutes!
That's why it's so important to know CPR!
When we are surrounded by people who are against us, we can rescue him through professional knowledge, and not just stand there and do nothing, which is too scary.
“In China, our official data show that 300,000 people die unexpectedly every year, the most dangerous heart attack.
In the United States, the average survival rate is 15%.
In the casino hotel in Las Vegas, nearly 78% of the guests were saved, and only 1% in Shanghai and Beijing.
This is the first response from the founder of the initiative, Lu Lei.
If a person suffers a heart attack, breathing stops, the heart stops, and you are useless.
We must do artificial respiration and external chest compression to save people.
I found that we are still very few people who have this kind of awareness to learn emergency rescue, but when the situation occurs, it doesn't matter, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can make a timely response in the face of emergencies.
We can save a life!
Emergency witnesses can be registered at your local Red Cross training center, and I am registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. Students are still welcome.
PS: Finally, the last picture is a record of the target you completed when you were 25 years old. Joining the target list was a few months ago, but it was really completed!
After examining other certificates, I planned to take a water rescue certificate. I saw another emergency rescue certificate in the small red book, so I thought I still needed an emergency rescue certificate before I could take a water rescue certificate. In fact, the emergency rescue certificate is still very useful!
I ordered #Number
Among the 13 species of shrimp, there is only one!
I haven't tried
Why #NAME# is not clear?
Is it necessary to have 13 elements?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# delivered food, and this time it was a shrimp dumpling for me!
Because I saw the valid code before
First of all, I think "Four Seas" is a comprehensive film from all perspectives.
But you have to say that this film is not a highlight and it is not qualified to be selected.
Slime is very diverse, allowing you to sleep in the movie theater like a pig on the top of Mount Everest, which can use countless ways to burn your anger.
On this point, Han Xu really deserves praise.
The most irritating thing about this piece of work is that it is a creature in the Cthulhu Mythos, which is difficult to name and has a lot of holes like the windbreaker on the body of a small horse.
Even after you finish watching, you may wonder whether there is a hidden message here, but after careful consideration, you will find that it is just a coincidence.
First of all, I don't understand some festivals.
The male head of household should live in the southern part of the island, and his mother-in-law should live with him.
Her mother's wish is to see the snow, and then the situation is arranged for her to go to the northeast to see the snow.
The elderly sit in the snowmobile from the south to the east?
He and his father are still very relaxed.
After that, the old man did not say anything.
How did she get the business license?
Why is it so easy to turn a mountain road into a tunnel?
After that, the truck carrying steel rods stopped on the roadside, and the drivers of the four surrounding trucks could not find it.
This is too obvious.
Why will a letter that does not work and is suspected of being illegal become a police officer?
In the face of high-interest loans, the police also asked whether there was any difficulty?
A grown-up knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a card to open the door in the museum, and then insistently arranges to find the museum keeper and sleeps outside the door of the room?
This Christmas is full of surprises in the whole film, and because the Christmas is too exaggerated, I will feel sad when I recall it.
Besides the holiday, the most terrible thing is the film's theme, or to say that the film has no theme at all, which is a face-to-face horror.
The film starts like a comedy, but after 20 minutes or so, you think it might be an inspirational film, and after half an hour, you think it might be a film about overcoming the difficulties of growing up in a small town, and after watching it, you wonder why you went to the cinema to watch it.
For many people, it is also very familiar with the road of various films. For example, if you want to make a movie about climbing a ladder, you will encourage + comedy, and then tell the audience that a bird with wings is a step away from success.
If you want to shoot a love film, you can talk about the enmity between the young people and service staff in the small town of Qingcheng.
If you want to reflect reality, your holiday cannot be the same as that of the normal world.
For example, the character played by Zhang Ziyi was burned, and then he could sing.
As to whether the female lead is weak-minded, I don't know whether it is a requirement of the play or the director's request.
Another thing I don't understand is why Han Zhang is so passionate about adding a car accident to his own film?
The film is scheduled to be released during the Spring Festival, is it for the sake of the audience?

The production and processing equipment of the clay model of the well was introduced:
Zhengzhou Yinyi is a professional manufacturer of concrete inspection drilling rigs, blasting drilling rigs, and wall body concrete inspection drilling rigs in China. From semi-automated to fully automated production lines.
Through years of practice and development, it has been equipped with a quality that is too strong. The main production pressure, mobile pressure, full self-checking well series equipment and auxiliary equipment.
Inspection well mud model production processing equipment:
The characteristics and advantages of the production and processing equipment of the clay model of the inspection well:
Yi Xin checks the new type of demolition material for various civil engineering structures such as coal, hot, water, electricity, gas, etc.
For example: inspection wells, reservoirs, rainfall shafts, chemical pools and small buildings, bridges, and other structures.
The advantage of using precast concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the top and bottom left and right four sides of the module are concave, forming a chain link.
The wall body of the well resisted far better than the demolition form of the demolition body.
The module is a hollow structure, and the joints of the bricks are connected in a vertical direction, and the joints of the bricks are connected horizontally, and the bricks are filled with concrete, forming a reinforced concrete network structure, which has a secondary reinforcement and waterproof function.
The module is equipped with ribs on both sides, and the ribs on both sides are welded to increase the overall strength of the structure.

The intelligent control equipment of the shale gas well inspection module includes a data input and output device for the shale gas well inspection module equipment, which can realize the ideal human-machine dialogue, self-analysis of materials, density movement, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The shaft lining machinery liquid pressure system uses single-pipe liquid pressure and delivery, double-pipe liquid pressure and delivery.
The independent pressure accumulation station avoids the impact of the host system on the pressure system, thereby ensuring the stability of the pressure system work.
The concrete inspection drill module, the cement bag hopper, the conveyor belt, and the self-propelled trolley are arranged on the top of the material hopper, and the material hopper door is closed. The entire system is completed independently by the hydraulic system, thus achieving the least damage and maintenance of the machinery.
The concrete inspection drill rig equipment is equipped with imported computers, electrical appliances, sealed components, and comprehensive performance is stable and reliable.
The excavation wall body module machinery is equipped with an all-steel frame, and the table surface is cut to fit the model without welding, allowing the concrete box to move freely, reducing the amount of machinery wear and tear.
To reduce the load on the model, reduce the amount of filler and increase the thickness of the seal, use a unified and synchronous design, and ensure that the effect is achieved.
Shaft body module machinery excavator, electric brain self-control excavator adjusts the excavator swing according to the price of raw materials, without grinding, thereby extending the service life, reducing costs.
The shaft lining machine has dual functions of self-control and manual control.

Chongqing pilot school of civil servants adopts modern student system, enrollment is corporate staff - Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the city's education commission that this year, our city will pilot the "modern student system" in 60 middle and primary schools. At the same time, the students who participate in the pilot training will be equipped with a student identity, and will be enrolled in the pilot enterprises after graduation.
The Municipal Educational Commission required that the regulations on the recruitment and employment of full-time students in colleges and universities be formulated, that the dual identity of full-time students in colleges and universities and enterprise staff be clearly defined, and that the three-party agreement be signed by the student, the school and the enterprise in accordance with the two-way selection principle. For full-time students who have not reached 18 years of age by the end of the 16th week of the school year, the student, the supervisor, the school and the enterprise must sign a four-party agreement to determine the specific position on the board, the content of teaching and the protection of the rights of the student.
Encourage pilot schools to use modern student-centered teaching methods and cooperate with enterprises to provide pre-employment training and retraining for employees.
The pilot school should reform the talent training model.
Colleges and enterprises jointly design talent training plans, jointly order professional teaching standards, course standards, qualification standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
As a pilot project, the duration of internship is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and is generally 6 months.
In order to implement the enterprise group organization management mode in practice, according to the different professional characteristics, one teacher can take 2 to 5 students to form a study group to ensure that the students master the skills required for each course.
According to the schedule, from 2016 to August 2019, my city has determined 60 city-level cadres to carry out the trial of modern cadres, with each trial person numbering about 50, and a total of about 3,000 students (students).
Based on the pilot, the principle of step-by-step promotion is adopted to establish a long-term mechanism for recruiting, training, and unifying sports in colleges and universities, so as to enhance students' skills and improve their employment rate and quality.

South African doctors: Omicron transmission is weak but more for light diseases
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the new coronavirus pneumonia caused by the mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is lighter than the disease caused by the mutation of Delta, although the transmission speed is faster.
According to the report of the doctors' organization in the Free State of South Africa, the doctors who are currently treating the new coronavirus patients say that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they are treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and fever-like symptoms.
The head of the organization, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he had to see about 10 patients a day, but none of them needed to be hospitalized.
Phelps said: "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of separation."
He said that this included the elderly and those with health problems. These people are more likely to fall into serious illness due to coronavirus infection.
He said that compared with the previous outbreak, the new coronavirus patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and had low oxygen levels."
Many people have to stay in the hospital for several days.
In the two weeks after the first report of the Ebola outbreak in northern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although enough data has been collected, it still needs a few weeks of time, but doctors' observations and early evidence provided some clues.
According to the South Africa National Institute of Communicable Diseases, among the new coronavirus patients in the hospital, only 30% were seriously ill, which was half of the proportion of the first wave of the epidemic; the average hospitalization time was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among the new coronavirus patients, only 3% died, while in the early outbreak in South Africa, the death rate reached 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the Africa Health Research Institute, quoted data and other reports from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and said: "At present, almost all the evidence indicates that this is a mild disease."
He also said: "Now it is still early, we need to wait for later data."
In most cases, the hospital and death occurred at a late time, and we only have two weeks in this wave of the epidemic.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rate, while testing the current vaccine and treatment methods.
Despite the fact that Ebola is still the main new coronavirus in the world, the outbreak of Omicron is occurring in more than 30 countries, with South Africa as the epidemic center.
According to health officials, the number of new cases of hand, foot and mouth disease in Guangdong Province in the first week of December increased by 400%. Tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were caused by the Omicron virus.

Education evaluation: What should be done to save the children?
If the famous proverb "without buying and selling, there is no killing" is used, then in the good environment without "buying and selling", the prevention and control group, the whole people's anti-buying and selling, and the anti-buying and selling behavior is not profitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not be repeated.
Recently, the Ministry of Public Security's Criminal Investigation Department announced that the platform for urgent release of missing children developed by the Ministry of Justice was temporarily suspended.
This is the authoritative channel for disseminating information on lost children and the timely information platform created by the Internet for finding lost children.
Listen to the name of the App called "Circle", and you will be shocked.
New technologies are not only called "cultural" and filled with emotions, but also informationized use, practical and effective.
The first goal is to rescue the kidnapped children and protect their safety and freedom.
The next is to deal with the doubts and rewards.
The significance of the pardon is not limited to the differentiation of punishment and social prevention, but also includes legal education.
But before selling the case, we should first pay attention to the safety of the injured person.
The matter is trivial, but under the urgent "rescue" purpose, controversial topics such as "whether children should be sentenced to death" can be postponed and discussed; but the rescue of the children cannot be postponed.
According to the experience of handling such cases, the suspect's son is accustomed to leaving the scene of the crime as soon as possible after committing the crime.
If the child runs away for a minute, he may be farther away from the parents, and the difficulty of the case will also increase.
In view of this situation, releasing such a direct and effective method as the "Circle" platform to break cases and find missing children is a practical action.
After all, "beating the drum" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
In order to protect the rights of juveniles and parents, from the improvement of the law to the protection of the law, as well as the concealment of law enforcement, there is no need to cling to the "protection of juveniles and the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child abuse can also be improved from the family to society.
For example, a common case is that a family of three rests in the car station and falls asleep, only to find that the child is missing.
As a parent of a two-year-old, you cannot expect your child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a preschooler, at least you should have some protection awareness.
The father and mother took turns to rest, and the child was placed under the protection of the stable mother, which was the most effective way to prevent children from being kidnapped.
From the perspective of the police cracking down on the sale of criminals, the buyer should also be punished.
A single illegal act is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, the legal punishment for selling children's crimes is 5 years; the special severity of the holiday may even lead to the death penalty and no compensation.
The punishment is high and severe, and in the trend of "light punishment", selling children's crimes is a serious crime.
To date, there are still many cases of fraud.
It can be seen that some people's views on the care and education of children and adolescents have been relaxed.
The legal education of some people should be synchronized.
In order to effectively control the sale of criminals, it is impossible to rely solely on the strict enforcement of the law by the authorities.
If the "market" is widespread, sellers are willing to take risks, constantly innovate selling methods, and form a "fight against law" scene with law enforcers, which will inevitably lead to low-efficiency.
Therefore, it is necessary to break through the stereotypes, including legal common sense, which will also help to solve and prevent child crimes.
Yang Hongdong delivered a speech at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Sixth Provincial Congress of the Communist Party of China
From the hundred-year struggle of the party
The Hunan Daily reported on December 10 that according to the arrangements of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, on the morning of December 10, the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and the Publicity Department of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, Yao Hongdong, went to the Mao Mountain Video Creation Base to interact with the video creation base and learn the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the CPC, learn the spirit of studying and implementing the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping to Hunan, and learn the spirit of the 12th Hunan Provincial Party Congress.
Yang Hongdong from the three aspects of ideological beliefs, initial mission, self-revolution and youth party, party leadership and party theory, etc., combined with his personal experience and family experience, deeply probed and comprehensively expounded the core essence of the spirit of the whole party and the practical requirements.
He pointed out that we should learn from the important speeches of General Secretary Xi Jinping and the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping, combine the spirit of the important speeches of General Secretary Xi Jinping with the spirit of the Provincial Party Congress, integrate the study with practice, enhance the self-awareness, political self-awareness and action self-awareness of "establishing the two centers" and "upholding the two centers", and firmly adhere to the direction of General Secretary Xi Jinping's guidance.
In the interactive exchange, the representatives of the grass-roots cadres, the representatives of enterprises and the representatives of the young people raised questions such as the relationship between the three historic decisions made by the representatives, how to understand the decisive significance of "establishing two", how to grasp the direction of cultural enterprises, how the young people in the new era can draw power from the hundred-year history of the party, and so on. Yao Hongdong answered the questions in a common language and with lively examples. He pointed out that the young party members should draw power from the party's hundred-year struggle history, tightly unite around the party center, firmly follow the party, and use their youthful enthusiasm to write reports and assume responsibility and tasks.

The International Olive Oil Council will divide olive oil into virgin olive oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and lampante olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil) two categories, five grades.
The first pressing of rapeseed oil, also known as natural rapeseed oil, is extracted directly from the fresh rapeseed oil by mechanical refrigeration, filtration and other processes to remove impurities.
According to the different degrees of acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Extra Virgin): It is the highest grade and the highest quality olive oil. It is a pure natural product.
The flavor is delicious, and the plant is fragrant. The acidity does not exceed 1%.
Premium quality sesame oil (Fine Virgin): slightly acidic, but not more than 2%, pure flavor and aroma.
Ordinary virgin palm oil (ordinary virgin palm oil): Taste and fashionable, acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
The refined rapeseed oil obtained after refining rapeseed oil with an acidity of more than 3.3% is called "second oil".
The refined palm oil can be divided into two levels:
Common olive oil (Olive Oil): refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil in taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, a transparent golden yellow.
Pure olive-pomace oil (Refined olive-pomace oil): is obtained by extracting olive oil from olive pomace through refining.
If you have seen the ranking classification, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is an important indicator.
It is necessary to know that orange juice is like grape juice, which is produced from different regions and different varieties of oranges, and will produce different standards of orange oil.
The best place to grow oil palm:
The coastal areas of China and the South China Sea have the most suitable soil and climate conditions for oil palm cultivation.
In addition to the coastal areas of China and Japan, its other regions can only be planted in suitable areas.
Mainland China:
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, France, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles, Reunion, Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, São Tomé and Príncipe, Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion, Seychelles, Mauritania, Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Equatorial Guinea, São Tomé and Principe, Angola,
Oil palm's harvest month:
Every year from March to June is the flowering season of oil palm trees. From September to October, the fruits begin to develop and mature, and change from green to red, purple, and finally black.
From November to February next year is the harvest season (the freshness of palm oil is very important).
The maintenance of palm oil:
Rapeseed oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the oils currently discovered.
The opening ceremony of the National People's Congress was held, and the president said that the flame of freedom will never be extinguished.
On Friday (December 10), the online "Democratic Summit" (Summit for Democracy) hosted by US President Donald Trump was held.
Biden said in his speech that the fire of freedom burns in the heart of every person in the world, and no special authority can extinguish it forever.
He also said that he plans to convene the second Global "Democratic Conference" next year.
Taiwan's representative and government official Tang Fei and Hong Kong's pro-democracy activist Lo Ka-on also spoke at the forum on the second day.
Biden said: "We know that the work we have done in front of us is a lot of hard work."
But we also know that we can welcome challenges, because I have said before that a democratic world is not a good thing.
Special powers can never extinguish the micro-fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and all over the world. "
Biden also said that the defense of democracy requires the concerted efforts of the entire society.
He said: "As the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the protection of democracy, promote reform, and make the government more transparent, so as to better resist special privileges and the power of special interests, and also to resist those who want to abuse the public interest for personal gain."
The theme of the second day of the "Democratic Convention" was the defense of human rights, the consolidation of democracy and the resistance to authoritarianism, as well as the counterattack against digital authoritarianism and the affirmation of democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, also said in his speech at the opening ceremony that the democratic cause is facing challenges on a global scale, especially the challenges brought by the new emerging digital technology.
He said: "Now is the time for reiterating the common values and perspectives and the democratic spirit."
This requires in-depth social dialogue, the resolution of unbalanced issues, the fight against corruption, the update of social contracts, the investment in quality education for women and girls, and the expansion of their opportunities.
This also requires a resolute rejection of all forms of nationalism, localism and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Law Kwong-yu delivered a speech via pre-recorded video, reminding the audience to continue paying attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities in China, including the Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been subjected to China's rise, but no mechanism has been established to question it."
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure the rebirth of democracy is our primary task.
Rogan also called on the free world to unite to resist the threat of the CPC.
He said: "Perhaps some of you are afraid of Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, and perhaps some of you are afraid of losing the Chinese market, and perhaps some of you are not aware of the threat of the CPC to our democratic values.
This is our failure.
This is also the reason we must change. "
Taiwan's Executive Yuan Policy Research Committee member Tang Feng said in the roundtable discussion on "Striking Back Against Digital Authoritarianism, Defending Democratic Values" that through the video release of the "National Declaration," Taiwan emphasizes its position at the forefront of resisting monopoly and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience of how to use information transparency and build mutual trust to fight the new coronavirus epidemic.
He said: "In the absence of democratic progress in Taiwan, we have always stood at the forefront of the global struggle against authoritarianism, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the epidemic, the authoritarian governments of various countries used public health and collective interests as their names, rationalized the infringement of human rights, and showed the backwardness of global democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we do not need to control the epidemic, and we do not need to suppress the holiday information.
At the same time, the US Department of the Treasury announced on the second day of the "Democratic Summit" that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities of China, North Korea and other countries that have been identified as seriously violating human rights, and also impose investment restrictions on a Chinese company that has been identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights abuses.

Their brains and pretexts are——it's so difficult to play tennis, you don't know how to play, and you don't want to buy expensive things, so you're going to make it easy for you, you're going to play twice, and you're not going to play anymore, so this video is convenient for you, and you don't care.

Hello, your meal will take a long time to arrive.
The house has been completed.
Your phone number is #PHONENUMBER#, and your name is #NAME#.
Don't be too greedy
Yes, but your horse is very difficult to handle.
Can you check if it is still on the road? If so, send it immediately.
OK, if you don't have it, you can return the money you paid for the meal.
In fact, the study of girls wearing underwear is very extensive.
The skirt worn by the fat girl cannot be too short or too long. The difference in length is not much, and it can be covered by the thigh fat if it is just right.
If the skirt is too short, the fat on the legs will be exposed.
If it is too long, it will give people a fat feeling.
If you wear it out, it will look like you have naturally grown taller. It's just that you're wearing different shoes, so it will look like you've grown taller.
In fact, many deep-colored T-shirts are a fashion accessory for micro-mini girls (the author has a deep understanding of this point). Deep-colored T-shirts are also a good way to cover your body fat, and high-quality and elegant black shorts are the first choice for micro-mini girls.
Wearing a black skirt, especially a short skirt, will make you look thinner.
If your legs are very fat, your socks and shoes should not be too noticeable.
As the popularization of VR becomes better, the color should not be too dazzling.
In order to avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet, let people feel fat.
For the slightly plump little girl, it is absolutely necessary to talk about how to wear underwear.
Micro-mini girls should not wear tight-fitting short skirts, and the skirt should not be too short or too long, which will make people feel very uncomfortable. If the legs are fat, you can wear a long skirt or a net skirt (a kind of lace skirt) in black, and wear a long-sleeved blouse, and you can cover the fat girl's shortcomings very well.
Of course, the girls in mini skirts are also worthy of discussion.
If you wear a short skirt, you should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which will make your figure look more slender.
Shorts paired with high-heeled shoes can make your legs look longer, which may be the hottest summer fashion!
If you are overweight, but your legs are thin, you should choose a pair of shorts that feels comfortable.
But it is more important to show your strengths.
The short skirt is very thin, which is suitable for fat girls. The top should be tight-fitting and form a layered effect.
A simple T-shirt with a short skirt can also be tried.
The micro-sized girls are also fashionable.
As long as you master the rules of wearing underwear, even the smallest girls will be the focus of everyone's attention.
After the change of wearing underwear, you also need to move more in life and compete with the early morning escape from the label of micro-obesity women.

Girl donates blood to her sister: "It's still good to donate blood" - Xinhuanet
A girl sits in front of a big tree on the square of Huangzhou War Memorial.
Yesterday morning, a photo of the "Hangzhou Girls Gongdansheng 'rocket' for sisters" went viral in the circle of friends.
Photos show that a girl sits in front of a tall tree on the square of the Hangzhou War Memorial, with the words "Human flesh clock, the 11th bullet" written on the tree, indicating that after paying the road toll, people can use the cannon to shoot.
This behavior aroused netizens' enthusiasm.
Last night, the person in charge of publicity and propaganda of the Shaoxing Municipal Public Security Bureau under the Shaoxing Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the reporter of Xinhua News Agency in Beijing that the police confirmed that the girl made such an emotional gesture because of her sister's donation, but such behavior is not worthy of praise. After being warned, the girl left yesterday.
The head of the girl's street "arrow" was arrested
In the network photo, a long-haired girl wearing a "one" sign stands in front of a big tree, and the tree is written with the characters of "human flesh clock, the 11th torch" in black ink. In front of another big tree, her bank account number, WeChat and Alipay account numbers are written.
The photo sparked controversy online.
Some netizens think that this incident is "disgraceful behavior" of the "eye of the ball", and many netizens share the same opinion.
We found the situation when we went around the square at around 10 a.m. on the 23rd. At that time, the surrounding crowds had already dispersed.
According to the media interview with the police near the scene, the two girls who were rescued were about 20 years old and dressed in youthful clothes.
Among them, the girl who plays the "human flesh doll" is always crying, and the other girl is helping to drink, saying that her friend's aunt has white blood disease and needs surgery immediately, please help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was donating blood for her sister.
Last night, the person in charge of publicity and propaganda of the Changzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau Xiangyang Sub-Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Jia Jia, and she donated to her sister Jia Nana.
But due to the need for more than 30 million yuan of expenses for treatment, it was difficult to think of a good way to raise funds.
He said that throughout the whole process, the two girls were the main characters, one of them was the director and the other was the assistant director, but they did not participate in it, and throughout the process, no one fired a gun, only people surrounded and took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
After the police took control of the scene, it was found that the shells used did not belong to the control range.
The person in charge said, "We do not encourage this kind of donation."
After being warned by the party, she has left the party.

It's not bad that the graphics of the game are really beautiful.
What is the most hot in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympic Games.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win medals?
In the past few days, there have been a number of articles on the "Quick Look! Project Manager Can Attack the Olympic Project" project. In the article, the project manager mentioned that project managers can work on many projects at the same time. Moving rocks, going on trips, and working through the night are commonplace for project managers, while rescuing, bailing out, and apologizing are not.
An article that looks like a joke, but also reflects the hard work of the project manager, behind which is the enthusiasm of the current project management work.
From the perspective of project management personnel, it is also possible to choose to get out of the situation through some actions.
According to the number of PMP certified project management professionals, more and more project management professionals are improving their project management capabilities through learning.
According to the "China Project Management Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP® examinations in China was nearly 600,000, and the number of PMP® certified people was about 42,000. The effective number of PMP® certified people was about 30,000, accounting for 31.2% of the global PMP® certification total.
In recent years, the number of PMP witnesses has increased year by year. This shows that more and more project managers have realized that it is no longer possible to rely on "old experience" to do things. The volatile work environment makes us realize that we need to learn, stand on the shoulders of giants, and explore the road ahead.
However, is it possible to ensure the smooth progress of project management work without PMP?
Many project management beginners said that through the study of PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically grasp the ten major areas of project management and the five major processes of project management knowledge points, but they are still helpless when it comes to real project management work.
Many project managers often complain about the following issues: the project management does not recognize the position, relies solely on personal experience, has no systematic project management theory, and does not know how to put it into practice; there is no systematic project management process to support the project management, and the work cannot be laid down, the project is not standardized, and the control and supervision are not clear; the division of labor is not clear, and the "old oil barrel" in the team does not know how to deal with cross-departmental communication; the project is difficult to promote ...
Therefore, special attention has been paid to product innovation and R&D management, which has helped many excellent enterprises to nurture a large number of R&D key personnel, such as product managers and project managers, and has won the honorary title of "China's enterprise R&D management talent training base" from the China Enterprise Confederation.
The online course of the "Development Project Manager Training Course" is an online course that helps you master the knowledge and skills required for project managers. It combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D-type enterprises to help you master the knowledge and skills required for project managers, and take the next step in your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less investment to promote the training process of project managers and bring high efficiency operation results to enterprises.
Without a mouth, you can first see how other students evaluate this course: This course is not only taught by a team of experts from China Telecom (formerly Huawei Research and Development Management Team), but also combines international advanced project management theory and many well-known enterprises' real business scenarios.
More importantly, it provides scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, and helps students to convert the content they learned in class into specific work.

Xi Jinping's "Double Twelfth" Consumption Advocacy - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double Eleven" online payment business transaction amounted to 17.7 billion yuan, an increase over the previous year.
The abundant reduction of red envelopes, the live broadcast of people holding the envelopes, and the delivery of the envelopes once again made consumers shout for joy, and this consumption fever made people feel the strong vitality of national consumption and also made people think about the impact of consumption on society and contemporary mainstream consumption groups.
In the run-up to the "Double Twelfth", Jingxing Consumption Financial Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jingxing") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption habits and consumption concepts, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the consumer financial literacy index in the country was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 from 2019.
In general, China's residents have performed better on the financial consumption level, but the differences in financial behavior and technology are more prominent, and further improvement in the financial knowledge level is needed.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and the young is relatively low, and "one old, one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; Noren's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" and the "2019-2020 China Young Consumers Consumption Report" show that the young generation has great consumption potential, credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, and 86.6% of young people are using financial products; although the overall consumption trend of young people is rational, it is far from the "over-consumption" label of the outside world, but some young people's excessive consumption and following-the-fashion consumption behavior have led to excessive financial pressure and credit risks, and even caused social problems to gradually increase, and financial institutions should take social responsibility and guide in a positive direction.
As a supporting financial institution, Jingxing has always been committed to providing high-quality and caring services to help ordinary people build a happy life, and has advocated that consumers establish good and correct consumption habits, and actively respond to regulatory calls to improve the rationality of consumer behavior, especially among young people.
In the past few years, Jingdong has continuously launched all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities targeting young people including college students, and has guided the rationalization of young people's consumption demand through various forms of cooperation with domestic top-level universities, helping them establish rational consumption concepts, rational planning of consumption demand, and accumulate personal wealth.
On the eve of the 12th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Jing Xiandong reminded all consumers to establish rational consumption concepts and correct spending habits, control blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumer credit fraud, and minimize the impact on personal letters and future economic life.
At the time of consumption, it is necessary to plan in advance and pay on time.
If there is a delay, the delay record will be recorded in the individual credit report, which may have a negative impact on economic life such as buying a car or buying a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose proper institutions and channels, and pay attention to whether the relevant institutions are qualified to operate.
In the future, Ant Financial will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumption finance system and the continuous replacement of financial products to bring more congruent services to consumers, continuously help consumers improve their financial literacy, help consumers cultivate rational consumption and moderate borrowing concepts, and become a trustworthy financial partner for consumers throughout their lives.

Vietnamese people's network - Hainan Cooperation Committee responds to common challenges
The station of Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud includes the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman.
It is worth noting that this is the first time that Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, has visited Qatar since the imposition of sanctions on Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its allies in 2017, leading to an increase in maritime security risks.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
The tense and serious impact of foreign affairs has had a negative impact on the internal cohesion of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and has had a negative impact on the economic production of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries sealed off the land-sea route to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the January 2021 meeting of the China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation Committee. All ASEAN countries signed an agreement proposed by the United States and Singapore to move towards "cooperation and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working hard to restore relations with Qatar.
China and ASEAN countries should unite to meet the common challenges faced by all countries in the region and the world, with the aim of safeguarding the common interests and regional stability of all countries.
During his visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two countries along the coast of the two seas.
The 725-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of the two countries' citizens.
The Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $50 billion in Aman, and the two countries have signed a memorandum of understanding worth $30 billion for 13 cooperation agreements.
Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud visited Iran to congratulate Iran on the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - an agreement between Iran and the world's major powers to resolve the Iranian missile issue.
The countries in the South China Sea have always considered Iran as a long-term "competitor" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The countries in the South China Sea believe that not resolving the Iranian missile issue and not taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region are risky.
Under the background that nuclear talks between major powers and Iran have failed to satisfy the aspirations of all countries in the region, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct talks.
The goal is to stabilize the tense situation in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the growth of the economies of the member countries of the SCO.
The upcoming Summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will be the first ASEAN Summit since the conclusion of some member countries' disputes with Cambodia.
This is an opportunity for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to re-evaluate its foreign policy achievements in promoting the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) as a systematic contribution to the ASEAN Summit, and to propose various measures to ensure that its member countries fully cooperate to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of ASEAN countries.

This time our team brought this car to everyone, it is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar - Aventador LP700-4!
The price is near 200 million yuan, the road tax is 10,000 yuan a year, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Because you have 700 sheep, can you imagine faster?
I don't know if the editor knows that only 2.9 seconds is needed to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h, which is probably the time it takes for myvi to reach 30km/h.
The low-slung car body, the sharp-edged doors, the huge intakes all around the car body, and the 6.5-liter V12 engine under the glass, perfectly explained the style of Lamborghini.
For the description of the car loan, you don't need to say too much. Just Google it, and the little editor has done some editing for you!
Too much preparation, everyone is watching everywhere! (It's actually pretty cool!)
1km of oil money is about RM1 (car owner does not care)
The posture of driving a car needs to be practiced, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because it will be difficult to get out of the car after parking).
The flagpole is too big, and when the car is lowered, the flagpole will hit the car. (But it is still very beautiful)
The car is too big, and the parking space is very narrow, and I'm afraid that I will be hit by a car when I open the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (the editor's self-talk, unrelated to the driver of the car)
Don't be mistaken, this video is not for sale. Sorry!
If you want to shoot a video for your car, please contact us!

Let the spirit of college and the spirit of the times be synchronized-Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of academic concepts and value pursuits that have been formed over a long period of time in the development process of a university. It is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of universities has been closely related to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and society, and even to the progress of the nation.
From the birth of the world's first modern university, the university has assumed a unique mission different from that of other social organizations. For Chinese universities, rising to the challenge of national difficulties is the source of its vitality, and its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocates the value of "Mingdejisheng, Shijiqing" and the patriotism of "Xingxu Guojia".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more prominent, and the competition in education, science and technology, and talents is becoming more and more fierce. Higher education has become an important "supplier" for society, and its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the General Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and World-Class Academic Disciplines is particularly noteworthy. On the one hand, it reflects China's confidence and determination to become a high-level educational country from a high-level educational country, and on the other hand, it proposes higher and more updated requirements for the development of universities.
How can we catch up with the world's leading universities in such a short time? How can we accelerate the construction of world-class universities and world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap? How can we realize the "leapfrog car"?
In addition to unwavering belief in the target, belief in the road, and belief in capabilities, colleges and universities should also fully play the three advantages: one is the advantage of following up, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas scholars, learning the advanced experience of world-class universities, and achieving a significant improvement in academic level and quality of study; the second is the advantage of cultural superiority, inheriting the wisdom of five thousand years of Chinese civilization, promoting the development of excellent traditional cultures, and concentrating strength, shaping the brand, and improving the image; the third is the advantage of system superiority, playing the role of a socialist country, strengthening the driving force of the target, gathering consensus, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a solid guarantee for colleges and universities to accelerate their pace and surpass the advanced level of world-class universities.
In particular, we must be aware that building a world-class university cannot be done by a thousand colleges at the same time. At the same time, each school must highlight its individuality and characteristics.
The characteristic of studying in China is not only to have the common characteristics of Chinese characteristics, but also to show the target positioning, study traditions and resource constraints of each individual.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we have highlighted three characteristics in our study: first, we have highlighted the cultivation of innovation and entrepreneurship talents; second, we have highlighted the optimization of the integration of science and education; and third, we have highlighted the cultivation of cross-disciplinary talents.
In this process, it is important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate with each other.
For Zhejiang University, "seeking innovation" has become a common value of campus training, "study, self-cultivation, enlightenment, and realization" has become a common value of campus training, and "Hainan River, starting a new life, building a new country" has become a common value of campus training.
This is the school's firm adherence to the correct direction of study, continuous accumulation of high-quality culture, and concentration of spiritual strength, which is rich in content and profound in meaning.
Among them, the emphasis of "Hainan River" is on open-mindedness, embodied in the spirit of "using the world for me"; the emphasis of "Starting from Hainan" is on the pursuit of excellence, which refers to the pursuit of excellence in university education at the same time as the pursuit of truth; the emphasis of "Opening the Country" is on the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of new knowledge, scientific research, and reform and development; and the emphasis of "Building the Country" is on the spirit of patriotism, which means that universities should always be inseparable from the national mission.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University.
“Listening without sound, seeing without shape.”
China's colleges and universities, in order to further realize the socialist cause of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, deeply understand the historical mission and position of higher education in the era, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independence, let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation interact with each other, and provide unprecedented driving force for the realization of national prosperity and the revitalization of the nation.

After seeing the news about the price of a friend's stock, my greatest feeling was the choice of the industry in which the enterprise competed, as well as the choice of the industry in which the investment benchmark was set. First, it is necessary to choose an industry with a large growth space, at least 100 billion yuan in market size; second, it is necessary to choose an industry with good growth prospects in the future, considering that the industry's growth rate will reach the best state in the next three to five years; finally, it is necessary to choose an industry with policy support.
The scope of the competition is the market scale, and the length of the competition is the development stage of the industry. The competition is flat or steep depending on the competitiveness of the industry.
Add fuel to the competition!
In the new year, the first thing is to adjust the 2022 battlefield layout in 2021.
The art of war is "doing the right thing" and "doing the right thing".
The strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find the direction, and the art is to lay down. On the vast majority of artistic thoughts, there is a space for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of visitors (artistic thinking) is to continue to deepen in the current field or expand horizontally (strategic thinking); how to increase the retention rate of visitors (artistic thinking) is to consider how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in terms of increasing the participation rate of events (artistic thinking), it is necessary to consider how to set the correct event KPI, achieve the correct event goals, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value customers, and accurately targeting new customers; and in terms of improving the DAU (artistic thinking), it is necessary to consider whether the current growth is sustainable.

Thanks to the photographer and makeup artist, I have a unique wedding photo.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to all the staff who took part in the shooting today.
Photographing the wedding ring is a simple body movement, especially for photographers.
The makeup artist was very meticulous in designing a makeup suitable for my face, and the photographer was silent when he took the photos, which was worth praise.
Thanks to my photographer and makeup artist, I can still see myself as beautiful.
The bride is beautiful, and the groom is tall and handsome. Just looking at them, you can tell that they are a good couple. Afterwards, they will work hard to support the family.
Xilang's calculation is that he is lucky to be happy and beautiful.
The quality of the wedding photos is really good, just like what is said online, I and my boyfriend are very handsome and beautiful, and we are very happy.

As long as the photographer's choice is good, you can also have a beautiful wedding photo.
The most important thing is that the photographer and the hairdresser are both online. Fortunately, I met.
After seeing my wedding photo, I found that I was also a "fraud".
The complaint of the Myanmar ethnic group against the admission of three common spring flowers - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, D.C., May 23 (Reporter Xu Xiaomei) On the 23rd, more than 130 ethnic groups in the United States submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice, protesting that three universities - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College - discriminated against Asian-American applicants during the admission process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which filed the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The president of the group, Zhao Yaquan, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of minority applicants who meet the admission requirements of US colleges and universities has increased significantly, but the proportion of minorities in these three US colleges and universities has basically maintained the same level.
Many studies have shown that colleges and universities in the so-called "comprehensive assessment" admission process have "long-term and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants."
Zhao Yukun said that research by scholars such as Sohdes in 2014 showed that in these three colleges and universities, the proportion of minority applicants was the lowest among all races.
The data from the US Department of Education also shows that in all colleges and universities in the Confucius Alliance, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for minority students, and the University of Rochester and Brown University have practiced racial quotas for minority applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yuankai told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hoped that after the submission of the application, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice would launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admission.
They also hope that colleges and universities can take the initiative to address this issue and change admission policies for minorities.
At present, the three colleges and universities mentioned in the complaint have not responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015. At that time, it was reported that Harvard University discriminated against the admission of Asians, but the US Department of Education did not handle it.
In addition to the participation of Chinese Americans in the complaint, it also includes American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Philippine education groups.
It needs to be nutritious.

In September 2020, Mr. Lv learned from the house that there was a factory building located in Zhejiang Yi'an Town. After several visits to the scene, Mr. Lv decided to buy the factory building.
In December of the same year, after the details of Mr. Lun's acquisition of the factory were negotiated with the owners of the house, he transferred 20 million yuan to the bank that day.
Lin signed as the person in charge of receiving the deposit on the contract for the sale and purchase of the factory, and his signature was "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller, and both parties will sign the contract for the sale and purchase of the factory within one week."
However, after the two sides failed to reach a consensus on major contractual issues such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, the signing of the contract for the sale and purchase of houses could not be arranged.
Considering that the two sides could not reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, after a few days, Lin will return 20 million yuan to Mr. Lun.
It is not easy to see the house in the middle of China, and the mortgage has been paid, the loan has been prepared, and the "door-to-door" contract has been signed, but the seller did not sell, which made Mr. Lu angry.
In view of this, Mr. Lun will bring the case to the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Court.
The court believes that the parties failed to sign a formal contract at the end, which cannot be imposed solely on the defendant, and the case is not eligible for a fixed penalty. Therefore, the defendant does not need to compensate twice for the breach of contract.
After the trial, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the Second Circuit upheld the original ruling.
The lawyer reminded that in the course of the transaction, we should pay attention to the due diligence.
At the time of signing the contract, as the buyer, you should pay attention to the due diligence responsibilities, such as verifying the authenticity of the ownership information of the house, whether the house has been occupied by people, and so on, and clearly specify the specific time and place for delivery in the contract to prevent disputes from arising at the time of delivery.
After the conclusion of the "Democratic Summit" in Germany on Friday, the spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on Saturday (December 11th), saying that the United States held the "Leaders of the People's Summit" and that the "democratization of tools" and "weaponization of tools" were used to "democratize" and "weaponize" the name of the "Democratic Summit" and "demonstrate opposition to democracy" and "transfer domestic contradictions"
The Chinese government believes that "over a long period of time, the United States has strengthened its political system and value system, promoted 'democratic reform', abused unilateral sanctions, instigated 'color revolutions', and caused disastrous consequences.
The word "minority" has already become a "large-scale killing weapon" in the United States.
This summit is a demonstration of the fulfillment of her commitment to assume office.
The two-day meeting will be held in video format, and the leaders of 111 countries will be invited, including Taiwanese leaders, but China and Russia have not been invited.
Before the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democratic problems and claimed that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
Internationally and domestically in the United States, there are also doubts, such as criticizing the invitation of some authoritarian leaders who have a tendency to monopolize power, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Brazil, and Bolivia, and questioning the real intention of the government to hold the summit.
The newly appointed German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, also attended the video meeting of the National People's Congress
The statement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on June 6 said that "today's American-style democracy is more and more apparent, and the issues of money politics, personal politics, opposition to the party, political extremism, social disintegration, racial conflict, and income inequality are becoming more and more prominent." The American democracy is built on the foundation of capitalism.
President Trump said in his speech that "as the leader of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the wall of democracy, promote reform, and make the government more transparent, so that we can better resist special privileges and the power of special interests, as well as those who want to abuse the public interest for personal gain."
He stressed that democracy is not inevitable, "We must constantly update it, and in my view, this is our generation's defining challenge."
Benedict also said that the global challenge of democracy and human rights is "a challenge that continues and makes people anxious, and democracy needs to be defended by fighters."
On the US side, the commitment is to launch a one-year action plan after the Democratic Convention, including a proposal of 4.244 billion US dollars to strengthen democracy worldwide and provide support to independent media.
The United States hopes that all countries participating in the planned 2022 National People's Congress to make specific public commitments to improve its democratic system.
Biden said, "Let all our countries implement our commitments and report our progress next year."

Taste and service are warmly welcomed
Nichang Old Store has also been popular for a long time. It is located in Dong'an Building, which is made of wood.
The door is always waiting for a long time before you can eat the steamed buns, and the steamed buns are cracked...
In the past few years, the rise of various small shops has dispersed the flow of customers.

Everyone's love is different, some like to collect, some like to eat, of course, some like to drink, and Red Label Whisky is one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in the world, and Red Label Whisky has won the International Spirits Award.
Each bottle of red wine has its own unique flavor, but if you don't know how to taste it, you won't know how sweet it is.
Why do you drink so much red wine?
The editor briefly introduced.
The red-haired witch drinks wine:
The whisky is composed of about 35 types of Scottish whiskies, with aromatic and traditional Scottish whiskies. The aromatic whiskies have a sweet and smoky flavor.
The entrance is fresh and fragrant, with aromatic tobacco and strong flavor.
The drink can be used directly with ice water or mixed with the favorite drink.
The popularity of red envelopes in China has lasted for a long time, and the combination of red envelopes and milk tea, red envelopes and snow-white milk tea, and red envelopes and new milk tea has become a long-lasting fashion.
These sweet drinks can not only be mixed with vinegar, but can also bring pleasure to the eyes, join the drink, and change the effect of sour drinks.
The combination of red wine, bitter melon, and sugar (sand sugar can also be used) is the most authentic and traditional drink.
Some of the sourness of the authentic red vinegar is balanced by the sweetness of the sugar, and the sourness of the vinegar will bring a fresh fragrance to the wine, of course, the sweetness of the vinegar can be adjusted according to personal preferences.
The above three are the best-selling wines of the Red Wine Witch, and everyone can try as a reference. I hope that the introduction of the small editor can help everyone.
Educational Thought: How to Make College Entrance Examinations Make College Entrance Examinations "Students" "Students" - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou University of Transport wrote a letter to the school leaders, reflecting the anxiety of the college entrance examination and proposing to improve the difficulty of the examination, change the examination type, and let the examination truly reflect the students' actual level of demand.
Indeed, for a long time, college entrance examination has been a "hot topic".
On the campus of the university, students come from five lakes and four seas, with different abilities and different levels of learning, and the learning conditions are thousands of miles apart.
For a group with such diversity, there are different feelings, and it is difficult to avoid.
Of course, if the examination subject is a single topic and the repetition rate is high, the topic is too simple, and the feeling will be different.
Students who do not work hard may be able to concentrate, and if they want to try other methods, they may achieve half the effect.
In this regard, it is not uncommon for "students" to be absent from school without paying tuition fees, and even to get high scores in exams; "students" are always absent from classes, work, and note-taking.
It seems that the students of Lanzhou University reflect the problems that exist in the university entrance examination. I believe that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou University.
From this level of meaning, we should give credit to the three students who wrote the letters.
In fact, those who have graduated from college are clear that they have hit the preparation examination, thinking of various ways to "steal" the examination questions from the teacher, competing for the scope of the examination, asking for "special guidance" before the examination and even in the examination itself, and even in the examination itself.
In the author's view, as a quality assessment guide for teaching quality, the weight of a university entrance examination's passing and failing is more important than the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and science.
At the undergraduate level, specialization begins to be fine-tuned, and many specialized courses are based on basic knowledge.
Whether it is a basic knowledge point of a major, whether it is the content of a university entrance examination, depends on whether it is fully grasped.
The basic knowledge of undergraduates is basically the basic theories and basic common sense of their majors. From the point of view of knowledge points, the space of change is not large, basically fixed.
As the teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics that I learned in college 20 years ago is still important."
But knowledge points are basically unchanged, and they do not represent examination items that are repeated.
In many colleges and universities, examinations are usually organized into topic groups, and the examination papers are drafted by the subject experts, and the examination papers are also drafted by the subject experts, and the examinations are also drafted by the subject experts, so that it can be overcome to some extent.
But it is necessary to put forward a test item that is in line with the requirements of theology and the actual situation, and the title is in line with the overall situation of the students' study, which is difficult to reflect the correct distribution, and it is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching conditions and the degree of comprehensive analysis of the students' study, so as to make the test items more difficult and dynamic, so as to highlight the basic knowledge examination, and at the same time carry out innovative design of the test items.
The examination is the pillar of university education. What kind of examination is there? If there is an examination, there will be a corresponding examination plan for students. This will affect the effectiveness of university education in the future.
In response to the student's suggestions, the University of Lanzhou has attached great importance to the reform plan and has implemented it throughout the campus.
Require all educational units to organize teachers to conduct discussions and end-of-course examinations based on self-evaluation, to develop examination questionnaires and relevant systems, to strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination questionnaires and the review of examination results, to fine-tune the assessment of performance, and to strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all teaching links.
From the perspective of the mechanism, resolving the problem of a single type of question and the problem of repeated questions is a problem that universities need to face. Of course, it also requires the corresponding system to be launched. However, it is not just a matter of eating and drinking, but also a matter of teachers' comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation. It is not just eating and drinking, but also eating and drinking, and teachers and students will interact more positively. The examination will also be more in line with the actual situation, so that "teachers" and "students" will be more balanced.

Jin Fujin's wedding photography (Nanjie Store) is temporarily unavailable
Because we didn't arrange the time well, we changed the time twice, and the consultant Lana helped us arrange the time.
Later, he chose a good weekend shot.
The staff of Ms. Jin, no matter whether they are consultants or cosmetologists, are all praised.
This is my first time to officially beautify my face. I don't know if I will look this good in a day, haha.
Xiaoli and another sister (I'm sorry, I can't remember her name) are very enthusiastic about cosmetics. Cosmetics are also very natural.
The scenery was filmed in Jiangwan City, and the weather was very good that day. It was not cold at all. When shooting, the makeup artist often reminded us to wear our underwear, hats, and a little bit of makeup.
The photographer is also very mysterious. He seems to be happy every day.
During the selection of photos, because I saw a lot of examples on the Internet, I was unwilling to delete too many photos for customers, but when we selected photos, we really didn't think that one photo without adding a photo would be enough for a wedding album of 24 photos. It was said and I didn't have much time to take photos of the bride and groom. When I saw that there were more than 7,000 photos in the album, I was shocked and scared that I would choose too many photos.
Today's photo is fixed, and he sent it to me. I saw that it was not very good, and he helped me to re-fix it.
Compared with the photos taken by my mother-in-law before, I think our photos are too happy, simple and just what I want.
Sincerely recommend everyone to go and take a look at the wedding photos of the Han family!

3,200 newborn babies in Sao Tome and Principe do not have birth certificates due to special measures to prevent counterfeit paper
The Civil Registry Office of Sao Tome and Principe said that because of the special anti-counterfeiting ink used, it could not issue birth certificates to newborn babies from the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, the director of the agency, Kariamis, assured that all the babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system, and that the fake certificates will be sent out after they arrive next week.
On the press conference, he responded to a media report on the issue of printing newspapers in Saudi Arabia for more than 10 months.
He said that the problem occurred two months ago, and Sandoval also faced the same problem.
“Among them, one of the reasons was the impact of the epidemic on the production characteristics of Chinese factories, leading to a delay in delivery to China. ”
He explained that the counterfeit paper used in Saudi Arabia is different from that used in other regions, so it cannot be used as collateral in other states.
Cruise revealed that the latest batch of counterfeit paper had arrived in Singapore on June 6 and was delivered to the printing company on June 8.
“The embassy will send staff to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday to pick up the passports and return to Saudi Arabia to print the visas. It is estimated that two working days (December 20) can be delivered to the applicants. ”
“We will notify the applicants to go to the embassies and consulates in various countries to take the passports. ”

48小时后核酸阴性, 设“缓冲区 ”国务院联防联控机制要求加强口岸市疫情防控-新華网
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporter Dong Ruijin, Xu Tiancheng) On December 6, the Ministry of National Defense issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in coastal cities, requiring people who have left the mainland border cities (including Hong Kong and Macao) to have negative nucleic acid test proof within 48 hours, and those who have arrived in the mainland border cities to undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time range of the above-mentioned requirements is from the date of determination of the coastal cities in the provinces and municipalities to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice pointed out that the coastal cities with conditions may study the establishment of psychological prevention and relaxation areas within the leased area.
The relevant person in charge of the National Health and Health Commission said that for some coastal cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of local residents, and both sides are frequent.
Implementing the policy of regional differentiation in the management of epidemic prevention and control, the prevention and control line will be converted into two prevention and control lines. It is expected that the transfer of the epidemic front will be achieved, the epidemic prevention and control risks will be minimized, and the maximum epidemic prevention and control effect will be achieved with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
In recent years, there have been a number of epidemic outbreaks in China, all of which are imported from abroad.
The above notification pointed out that some local epidemic prevention and control measures were not timely, high-risk epidemic prevention and control measures were not implemented, periodic nucleic acid examination was not carried out in the form, cold chain products were not managed in accordance with the regulations, epidemic emergencies were not handled scientifically, and so on.
According to the notification requirement, from improving the urban epidemic prevention and control mechanism, strengthening the epidemic prevention and control warning system, implementing the border control measures, etc., 9 aspects are required to be strengthened to shorten the epidemic prevention and control emergency table, do not relax, do a good job in epidemic prevention and control work, and tightly link the external defense input defense line.
The notice stressed that all coastal cities should synchronously study and deploy the prevention and control of epidemic diseases and the prevention and control of public health, publish and distribute the hotline of public health, regularly check the basic living supplies and prices, and timely solve and proactively respond to prominent problems reflected by the people.
According to the notice, the coastal cities mentioned include open roads, waterways and airports, as well as the counties (cities, districts and flags) where the ports are located, the cities where the ports are located, and the cities where the ports are located, which are determined and announced in a timely manner by the provinces (autonomous regions and directly administered cities).
Color: The color of the photo is the closest to the real color of the object. If the color of the photo is different from the real color of the object, it means that the light source of the photo is different from the real light source, and the color problem should be consulted before buying.
This product is old, and the first-time buyer of an old product should search for "vintage" or "old" in Baidu.

If you decide to buy Gucci products, you should be prepared for this kind of heart. If you are a perfectionist, I will point out the small flaws. This is a characteristic of Gucci products, and personal opinions do not matter!
The products in the store are not exchangeable.
The so-called vintage means that the design will have a retro feeling, which is also the feeling of nostalgia. The reason why people like vintage is also the feeling of its age and quality!

Oil management video ends with a bloody scene-Xinhuanet
（Video source: Oil Management）
On December 11, a micro-film named "Death Machine" on the oil management platform caused widespread concern.
The film tells the story of the United States launching a "counter-terrorism" campaign under the name of "anti-terrorism" and using terrorism as a pretext to export American-style democracy for 20 years, resulting in the massacre of innocent civilians, torture without end, and genocide.
Using unmanned aerial vehicles to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian sites, distorting human nature, and creating death squads.
In the past 20 years, the US has killed tens of thousands of Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up a "black prison" for "suspects" and subjected them to torture and humiliation.
The hatred of the Afghans against the people of Afghanistan has been aroused.
As the video says, the US "anti-terrorism" campaign is "more anti-terrorism."
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan, but only brought destruction and death to the country and many countries.
Watching the video, let us together reveal the true face of the United States under the name of "anti-terrorism" and wear the mask of American-style democracy!
Without intending to see the following article, from the perspective of business and the preservation period, why the logistics company in the tax-free zone should help wrap the goods, although the wrapping belongs to deep processing and is not within the scope of operation of the tax-free logistics company, this article may also explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many milk powder factories and met many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the material of the bag is the same as that of the earring, without any difference.
Everyone will ask: Why is the shelf life of cosmetics one year, while the shelf life of clothing is two years or longer?
Or: Why is the price of clothes and bags so different?
In fact, from this starting point, there are many consumers, or the mother-in-law's opinion that the quality is not good because the material is not the same.
In fact, the original material is just what everyone thinks is valuable.
There are also consumers who say that the taste or flavor of eating after eating is not the same!
Now I follow everyone to talk about the reason for the high price of clothing, where is it?
Why are their original materials so expensive?
Because most factories consider that if the bag price is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit generated by the factory is low, or in other words, what can the factory do to survive?
Therefore, on the price of clothing, they have a very large margin to ensure their profit space.
Therefore, most of the factory owners preferred to listen to clothes rather than bags.
And how much advertising expenditure do you think that many factories need every year?
Everyone knows.
With the development of society, the promotion cost of the market, such as the promotion cost of the shopping mall, the clearance cost of the shopping mall, the donation cost of the product, the advertising cost, etc., are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, each factory is constantly adding new products, and the price is constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product released by the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost increase of their original materials will not exceed 3-4 yuan.
In addition, there are some brands that do not have the means to promote their own products, so they follow the doctors in the hospital and help the promotion of the products, from 30 to 80.
China's relevant laws are absolutely not allowed to operate in this way. In fact, this kind of behavior is harmful to consumers.
It is suggested that everyone buy a bag of clothes at home and put the clothes in the bag, which can save costs and increase the preservation and sealing of the clothes, and has no impact on the children.
There are also many people who do not think that the quality period of listening clothes is the same as that of bags. If the quality period of listening clothes and bags is the same after packing, it is difficult to store bags after packing, and easy to be damaged by moisture.

Don't let people talk nonsense-Xinhuanet
At the bookstore, I often feel the fire of successful textbooks.
Today's successful textbooks are very many "best practices" - that is, you are given a holiday or hinted that you can "do it," and then you are told what you need to do "is what."
That is to say, the child has passed the most important and most fundamental link.
Because of this, these books have a common feature - either they have a positive attitude, or they have a negative attitude; either they are 100, or they are 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you stay on the ground.
This kind of "best practice" will make people think that it is "correct without comparison", but 99% of people will be fooled by it.
Because of this kind of "you have to make up your mind, remake yourself, and make a 180-degree turn" theory, which is akin to a death sentence for many people.
For those who stay in accordance with the rules, follow the old rules, and refuse to change, you have to shout in his ear "you have to change" without a doubt, it is selfish and arrogant.
Most people will be hesitant before "transformation" on both sides, and it is difficult to make a final decision; or based on a temporary dispute, they make a final decision on "transformation" and dare to take the first step, but it is difficult to continue.
Mr. Mahathir's famous speech "From Tomorrow" is a classic example of this "universal humanity".
The biggest problem of the "best practice" is that the door is too high, which exceeds the limit of the ordinary person's ability and makes most people "wish the door is open."
Perhaps the "good practice" is just one of the possible paths that can lead more people to success.
The core of the "good habits" is the theory of "small successes leading to big successes": if you do not do 100, just do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; and if you do not climb Mount Tai, just climb your front door's little sand hill, because that is also a small step.
In the end, as long as you do something, it doesn't matter how strong it is.
Because the size of the door is reduced, there are more possibilities for ordinary people to insist, and as long as they insist, the success rate will also increase.
However, following the "successful model" of the "successful model", its road length is longer.
On the whole, the "best practice" is a flag that makes everyone successful on the surface, but in the end it can only inspire a small number of people; while the "second best practice" can effectively inspire more people to benefit as much as possible.

The amount of fish resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 71,000 tons this year-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Agriculture and Rural Department of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results show that the amount of Qinghai Lake shrimp resources has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons, an increase of more than 40% compared with the initial protection in 2002.
The common name of the carp in Qinghai Lake is "Qinghai carp", which is a valuable fish species in Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in ensuring the safety of the ecological chain "water-fish-bird" in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 1960s and 1970s of the 20th century, due to the impact of factors such as the decline of fishing grounds and overfishing, the number of grayling in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the grayling resource storage in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake Roach was listed as an endangered species in the Red Book of Chinese Wild Animals.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the ban on fish farming in lakes, prohibiting any units, collectives, or individuals from fishing in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of fish and their products.
At the same time, through the artificial breeding and release and the cleaning of the main inflow rivers of Qinghai Lake, as well as the design of scientific and rational "overfishing channel" and other measures, the storage capacity of Qinghai Lake has been continuously increased.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Office of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, said that as of now, a total of 180 million fry of Qinghai Lake roach have been released, accounting for more than 23% of the restoration of Qinghai Lake roach resources.
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important ecological barrier and water source area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural ecological barrier and ecological function zone that controls the aridification of the western desert.
In order to protect the ecological environment and water ecology of the source area of the Yangtze River and the Qinghai Lake water area, and to protect the diversity of wild animals in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since the beginning of this year, the Qinghai has successively issued bans on fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake, and has built a "one river, one lake, one lake" comprehensive ban on fishing management system.

The restaurant only gave me one bag, and I had to put it in the bag, and the weather was cold.
Is the export in a bag?
We only see one bag
I don't know if it was a leak or if someone took it. Thanks.
It has been more than an hour, and it has not been sent yet.
After reading a holiday article, it was too long.
To an unknown male physician.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first holiday at the age of 13-15.
After the healthy premise, it will come every month.
But it is not legal to accurately predict, about a week of public holidays, you need to prepare in advance, and sometimes the mood will change (suddenly prepare a few days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the degree of pain vary from person to person. Some people bleed for three days, some for a week; some people bleed less, some bleed more; some people have no reaction, and some people scream when the ambulance moves; the degree of pain changes with time, and it does not represent that a child does not bleed.
Unable to control the moon, the bleeding lasted for 24 hours from the beginning to the end. The only thing that could be done was to use a sanitary napkin or sanitary cloth to absorb the blood and prevent it from reaching the bed.
The main reason is that the inflammation of the mucous membrane is due to the inflammation of the mucous membrane caused by the inflammation of the mucous membrane. The inflammation of the mucous membrane has not yet come and the inflammation of the mucous membrane can effectively relieve the inflammation of the mucous membrane at the beginning of the month. After the inflammation of the mucous membrane, nothing is eaten.
Prior to pregnancy, due to excessive blood loss and excessive release of hormones by the placenta, it is easy to swell the uterus.
If it is almost the end of the week, Mr. and Mrs. Moro will come to see the moon.
The best time to change the sanitary napkin is every 2-3 hours. It is easy to breed bacteria if the sanitary napkin is not changed in time. The worst condition is to change the sanitary napkin 6 times a day, 7 days a month, which is 42 pieces a month. If you add the pieces that are prepared in advance, it may be 50 pieces a month. It is not every month that one piece is used.
In this case, the life thread does not need to be changed frequently. It can be changed in about five to six hours. It can be changed for up to eight hours.
It is possible that the moon period may be more harmful than the Mercury period, and the period may also be unstable due to the change of internal hormones, which is very depressing and makes the body tired.
But the official crime rate data shows that the ability of women to control emotions is still very high, and it will not be used as an excuse for emotional problems.
The flow is not only blood, but also includes the exudate in the wound.
After the end of the lunar calendar, the interior wall of the child's house is the thinnest, and then gradually becomes thicker. It can be understood that the child's house is a house, and each month builds a house (the interior wall becomes thicker). If there are no guests, all the houses are demolished (the lunar calendar is dismantled) next month and a new house is built the following month.
The lunar calendar is very inconvenient. It has been more than 10 years since the lunar calendar has been in use. Every lunar month lasts for 24 hours. In addition, there will be abdominal pain and back pain. Who is willing?
But it is because of his mother-in-law's pregnancy that he can be born. The pregnancy is due to his mother-in-law's pregnancy. The pregnancy is due to her mother-in-law's pregnancy. Everyone should thank his mother-in-law for her healthy pregnancy.
In the past, many things were done to women, and society told women that they were brainless, disgusting, and everyone thought it was like that, but the times have changed.
If some people think that the moon is evil, think that a woman's body is preparing to give birth to life is evil, it is not right to say it in public, girls stand up, you don't have to think like that, you have never experienced it, this child will never experience it, and you don't understand men, you don't know how to repay your mother's kindness, how to think of your children?
Finally, my sisters tried to use the life thread, which was really useful.
Today is the winter solstice, which makes people lose hope
In addition to ordering a meal for the little friends to eat
It is hoped that all store clerks will check the goods
Is there any leakage in the foot bath?
Choosing a suitable foot bath can play a good role in foot care, and today's National Medical Small Editor will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
As people's health awareness increases, more and more bathroom accessories are becoming popular with consumers, and a whole range of different products are appearing on the market, from hundreds to thousands of different bathroom accessories. This has given consumers a lot of choice.
On the data side, compared with traditional home appliances, sanitary appliances such as bathtubs have caught fire, but bathtubs do not have special industry standards, so there is a certain safety hazard.
“In the water of electricity, it is too dangerous!”
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath to send to his father for a birthday gift, but his father's feet felt numb.
Mr. Li initially thought that the washing function of the bathtub was activated, but he did not expect that the washing function was related to the washing function. The father was also surprised.
Mr. Li used a pen to try, and the pen naturally lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the bathtub naturally carried electricity.
Afterwards, he contacted the merchants, and the merchants' attitudes were not bad. Although he had lost his bathroom, Mr. Li still felt uneasy.
Because he discovered that the footbath bottle, which has been popular for a long time, is now set at the highest temperature, suitable for which group of people, and which material guarantees no harm.
However, in general, the wash basin is unlikely to have electrical problems, but it does not exclude a few products that are not strictly inspected at the factory.
Therefore, when buying, choose a separate foot bath.
Water-electric separation, no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can also use a measuring tape.

I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all my friends who have given humanitarian aid to my family and me over the past 30-plus years. In particular, I would like to thank my friends who have sent humanitarian aid to me under my personal name since I issued the appeal for humanitarian aid in 1994. To date, the aid has not stopped.

At present, the new coronavirus epidemic is spreading globally, and most of the donors have retired.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop giving us a hard time—the Tiananmen Mothers Group collectively donated money to the people, and this people's rescue activity should have been completed early.
I will always remember your love and I firmly believe that your deeds will be recorded in history.
Due to the reason of species, I can only express my intentions in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere congratulations.
Industry: Please allow me to borrow this opportunity to briefly introduce the history of 32 years of humanitarian assistance by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Myanmar China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of carrying out humanitarian assistance, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) and the Mingde Foundation of the Republic of China are two parallel organizations, and the implementers of the projects often cross.

The rescue loan is often difficult to send to the hands of the victims.
In 1994, Mr. Zhang suggested that a special group be set up by "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and distribute donations for disaster relief.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "Six Four Orphan Education Foundation" and has been implementing it for 11 years. In 2009, after all the "Six Four Orphans" graduated from college, the MCDF established the "Six Four Orphans in Hardship" and has been implementing it until now.
The funds for these projects mainly come from campus and social donations in 1964, donations from individuals, and support from the Democratic Foundation of the University of Hong Kong.
Since 2018, it has also received the support of the National Natural Science Foundation.
Until last year, after 31 years, the victims of the June Fourth Incident finally received some donations from Hong Kong.
During this period, "China Human Rights" also carried out its humanitarian projects independently.
We understand that Mr. Ding's call for donations is for the consideration of donors, and we are also some retired people who are not as rich as before retirement. We express our thanks to Mr. Ding's "friendly people" for his kindness.
We will respect their decisions and terminate this project within two years and resume it when necessary.
I would like to express my sincere thanks and respect to those who have always adhered to their convictions and risked their lives to send humanitarian aid.

If you want to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a local place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's still better to self-study. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes six months to learn.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training in this industry is a very good choice, especially for those who are self-employed and their weaknesses. Training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can choose self-study, but it will be exhausting.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, let's take a look at the capital strength of this institution. If the capital strength of this institution is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions also do not have particularly strong capital strength.
Before making a choice, it is best to investigate this training institution. It is best to investigate the students of this training institution. After all, only the students of this training institution know what this training institution is like. Whether the course is good or bad can be judged.
Hello, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't know enough about your personal situation. It is related to your personal situation and what you have learned.
For example, specialized language, age, and the willingness to learn, even in the same city, these will be related to the industry you are studying or interested in.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you are a computer professional who has already graduated, and if there is enough time for me to suggest self-study, this is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, there are many online training institutions on the line, but the cost is high and the time spent is more. Basically, you need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months.
But if I say these conditions, self-study is very convenient. There are many free learning resources on the Internet, and there are many training resources at the station. If you don't find resources, you can contact me and get free resources or detailed consultation.
There are also some classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but you are willing to pay a certain amount of learning fees and time costs, then I suggest that you learn from the institution. This way of learning does not require a lot of effort, and the teacher explains it in detail, and there are people who specialize in answering questions. In addition, there is also help in planning or supervision.
And now there are many training institutions that sign cooperation agreements with enterprises, have internal promotion quotas, and recommend graduates to enterprises, so the recruitment process can also be shortened.
The above is my viewpoint. Because I do not know your situation, I can only briefly introduce it. If you have other inquiries, you can contact me at any time.
I said a moment ago, I saw it in the App

Life is like this. Others only see the results, while you face the process, and face life. We are not only strong, but also continue. There is no choice. You can go back and see, but you can't go back and walk...
Cleaning is a job, but it is also a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of heart.

If you do your best and pay attention to details, we will be successful.
Give me the opportunity, and you will be satisfied with the quality, because the professional value deserves to be trusted, and I am most encouraged!
At present, all walks of life are not good!
But I firmly believe that as long as a sincere attitude, determination and effort, I will be better than others at least, and at least I will be better than others.
I hope that all the good things will start from the morning. I hope you will bring happiness, luck, health, and good intentions to start a new day. Keep a good mood throughout the day. Good morning
At that time, happiness was a matter of east and west, having it or not having it; after growing up, happiness was a goal, achieving it; after maturity, it was discovered that happiness was a state of mind, mastering it.
Make the most sincere and best self, follow your heart, live without regrets; life is a road, walk your own road; life has two treasures: a healthy body and a happy heart; live a beautiful life!
In every stage of life, there will be different difficulties.
At many times, what binds you is not your ability, but your positive attitude.
Unfortunately, we can't avoid it.
You are afraid, you will be trapped; if you do not welcome difficulties, the problem will eventually be resolved.
The organizer of the China Pavilion at the Venice Biennale and the Saudi Arabia Pavilion at the Venice Biennale held the first contemporary art biennial exhibition in Saudi Arabia - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou Huguang) Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial - The Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial, which opened to the public on December 11 at the Diriyah Art District in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, has 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participating.
The two-year exhibition is jointly organized by the Saudi Arabia Riye Foundation and the China UCCA Yuan Weijun Contemporary Art Center. Yuan Weijun, the director of the China UCCA Yuan Weijun, is the chief curator of the exhibition.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of the two-year exhibition is "Walking over the River with Stones", reflecting the reform and opening-up strategies adopted during the social and economic transformation period, as well as the current situation of Saudi Arabia's social and cultural development.
The two-year exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters. The exhibition hall spans six buildings that are connected to each other. The exhibition is divided into six units: "Walking over stones," "Transmitting as an experiment," "Thinking about the border," "Going to the public," "A beautiful new world," and "The spirit of art."
Among them, the number of works by 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of works, including painting, installation art and performance art in various forms; 12 Chinese artists' works were also well received, and some artists used innovative methods to create works using recycled materials, such as Xu Bing's "Mountain and Stream Without End" (2014), which reconstructed a classic mountain-and-water painting using waste materials.
Bakkali, the first deputy director of the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center, said that he hoped that this biennial exhibition could build an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to understand the cultural and creative industries and innovative communities of Saudi Arabia.
Tan Shouyu said: "The goal of the two-year exhibition is double-sided. It can enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogues, and can also enable Saudi audiences to enter the contemporary art world."
It is understood that during the opening week of the two-year exhibition, a series of lectures will also be held, and the opinions of artists, curators and creative industry leaders will be discussed on the theme of cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Unified Regulations for the Management of Village Public Welfare Posts - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12, 2019 (Reporter Lin Boxiang) To continue to do a good job in the employment of poverty-stricken people, to consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs recently issued a notice to promote the management of rural public welfare positions in the countryside and promote the comprehensive promotion of rural public welfare.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial People's Hall, at present, Yunnan has a total of 448,300 commune-level public welfare positions, which are used for the resettlement of poverty-stricken migrant workers and other rural poverty-stricken groups, and play an important role in helping the poverty-stricken population achieve employment growth, consolidate the results of eradicating poverty, and improve the ability of rural public services.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments, including the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. It is unified and standardized in terms of the object scope, fund management, position development, position management, and other aspects.
In terms of the development of the site, the new regulations are clear and in line with the principles of "based on the needs of the site, based on the site, dynamic management, overall control" and "who develops, who uses, who bears responsibility" and "one person, one site, open and standard management".
The recruitment procedure must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, announcement, appointment, training and arrangement on the job.
In addition, the new regulations clearly defined the specific responsibilities of the main departments responsible for the development of rural areas, the standards for supplementary compensation and the supplementary compensation methods for the positions of rural areas, and required the relevant departments to regularly monitor the situation of supplementary compensation for the positions of rural areas.

Although the right-wing has had a glorious history, it is short-lived, so it is short-lived because it is easy to give children sunshine, to give children water, and to give children a flag; it is a little bit easy and a little bit easy, so it is easy to be hit and easy to lose hair.
But in fact, the right-wing has played an active role in social progress.
From the end of the definition of the realization of the Truth, the development of the economy, the improvement of science and technology, and the promotion of institutionalization and the protection of human rights, the positive role of the right should not be denied.
As for me, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's words, I am very in line with his words, and I also respect Li Weidong very much. Because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he is sincere about China's social issues.
But I oppose his counter-revolutionary theory, I believe that counter-revolution is inevitable, counter-revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, the people's livelihood will be damaged, and the political parties will disintegrate, and then it will be foreign interference.
Fourth, we must change or improve the attitude of the Chinese people who are willing to endure hardships and make sacrifices for the country and the people, and political machinery attempts to take advantage of the flag, which is not right-wing, but a mixture.
Good night.
On the one hand, it is a betrayal of the era and politics.
If the right has a positive role in society, the Communist Party will also listen to some of the right's ideas and analysis of their thoughts when it needs to, so the left has not created this, because the left's main thing is the Communist Party's betrayal!
Five, I have recently seen some friends who are very close to the disease, and they are also very active.
It is not necessary to try to reason with him, he is a mental illness.
Don't try to prove that they are right, and don't try to make them admit that they are wrong. Why?
I told my friends: when you mock me for being bald, when you mock me for being right-handed, it proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people have dreams when they are young, but when they get old, they forget their dreams, or pursue their dreams, but end up deviating.
And the difference between reality and idealism is so great that even the youngest dragon becomes evil at the end.
On the left and right, I feel that most of the time it is about constraints and freedom, and that China should be on the left because of its cultural heritage.
The domestic right-wing emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens supervision and pays more attention to fairness and security.
At present, the general public hopes that more attention will be paid to fairness, while the Sino-US competition is inevitable, the left is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for a long time.
Although I don't understand, I'll give you a thumbs up
He also didn't say that flowers are so kind
In the past two years, the United States has not only locked up and surrounded Huawei's chips, but also let Huawei fall into an unprecedented predicament, and let "American" companies suffer great losses.
The U.S. pressure on China's semiconductor industry requires domestic enterprises and allied enterprises to seal off China's semiconductor industry at the same time, which directly leads to the cancellation of orders from global semiconductor suppliers and the impact on the research and development investment of semiconductor enterprises, resulting in the shortage of the global semiconductor supply chain.
At present, "shortages" have spread to all major industries around the world, such as automobile production and mobile phone prices, almost all industries that use chips are affected.
In order to grasp the "chip" self-determination, more and more countries' technology giants have embarked on the road of "going global".
In order to control the global semiconductor industry, to control the development of China's semiconductor industry, and to take the lead in the chip summit; and to invite 64 countries to set up a semiconductor alliance and provide financial support for US domestic technology giants such as Intel, which invested US$2 billion to build two semiconductor factories in Arizona, USA.
Most people think that this move will cause a certain impact on Taiwan's power supply, and there is a high possibility of causing a power outage.
The reason why this is certain is that, as a leading enterprise in the semiconductor industry, UMC has a large number of R&D teams and technical reserves, and must be able to rise rapidly in a short period of time to defeat Taiwan Semiconductor.
However, Zhang Zhongtian, the founder of Taitronics, is not disappointed.
At the "2021 Teacher Wisdom Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongtian said that he was shocked when he heard about the investment by Intel to build a semiconductor factory. Zhang Zhongtian said frankly: Intel is building a semiconductor factory, which is a bit embarrassing.
Zhang Zhongtian's hatred for Thatcher is not without reason. Zhang Zhongtian still holds a grudge against Thatcher for more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Thatcher was always the bright spot in the British manufacturing industry, and Xu Jiu was a global leader.
In the 1980s, the world's leading semiconductor high-end chips were still in the hands of a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. The chip was designed, manufactured, and tested by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of the era.
However, such a model makes it difficult for some small enterprises to bear the burden, and most of the guiding entrepreneurs face huge investment costs for the production line.
Under the call of market demand, the chip industry began to appear the phenomenon of subcontracting in the 1980s. In 1984, Zhang Zhongtong heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that it was natural to set up a factory specializing in the production of chips.
Not long after, Zhang Zhongtian's dream became a reality, and Taitong Power was born.
Tai Jitong focused on the "glass processing" single link, without design, only providing glass processing services.
At that time, the newly established Taiwan Stock Exchange was just a small blip.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongtian once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (TSMC) only manufactures chip-related products, it seemed to have a high degree of self-confidence and refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongtian also believes that at that time, the United States was looking for a service provider for the manufacture of glass spheres.
I didn't expect that the giant in the field of glass manufacturing services would also have to start making glasses.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongtian felt that it was not difficult for him to enter the circle of friends.
At present, the market value of Taichung Power has exceeded that of England.
Faced with the strong offensive of Taitung Electric, Ever Rich is also unwilling to be unyielding.
At present, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has begun mass production of 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm.
It is not easy to exceed the actual situation.
Not equal
At 19:06, I ordered 2 hours.
Today, let's take a look at some [curious hot spots].
What is the normal situation?
Three hot spots: February 2, the head of the dragon, the rise of the price of goods, and the incident of the riots, the mood spreads to form a wave, and then [the index falls] (smooth curve) finally dissipates, and if the mood recurs again.
They seem to be very similar to the <v>Internet Situation Model</v> shown by NetEase.
What is an abnormal situation?
Six hot-selling items in the same incident are shown as [isolated], [spike] and [broken].
The first is that people are willing to add heat, heat up quickly, and attract the attention of the public; the second is that the heat is seasonal, ensuring that the topic is hot; and the third is that the group splits, and the heat plays a "functional" role, and receives a new task and a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the wave of popularity of one event is almost the same as that of another event, and the time difference is only a few seconds. It is certain that the water army will receive a task and start a new round of attacks.
The professionalization of black propaganda can be seen in the following: a number of hot issues are up at the same time, which attracts the attention of the public, which is responsible for science and technology, which challenges the status quo, which transfers the focus of attention, which influences cognition, which misleads judgement, which arouses emotions, which mobilizes decision-making, which divides the account number of black propaganda, which divides the nodes of black propaganda, which almost considers all the elements in the dissemination of public opinion.
Transmission is a scientific problem, which is related to the opening of the stage and the subjective factors. It can only be judged from the customer's point of view, and the Black Public Relations will also be useless.
Whatever you do, you will leave a trace. This trace, we will dig it together.

Received a lot of money
The order is a fox
Fortunately, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#
Do I need to stay in the dialogue?
I said to your staff
Your horse told me the address was too far away.
360 Home Furnishing
Address: No. 156, Huancheng South Road, Happy Home, 12th floor
At the beginning, it was introduced by friends because of trust, so my initial budget was 70,000 yuan for basic renovation.
When you come to the store, you can start a series of frauds.
I came to the store for the first time just to show them my size, and they hadn't seen the house in person, so they were able to give me a price of 700,000 yuan for my 135-square-meter apartment. I didn't know what materials they were made of.
Their second scam is that as soon as you walk into the store, they will pull you into the store and force you to exchange the money (unless you have enough experience and they are willing to fight).
When I don't need to exchange money, they will invite their so-called manager to tell you that you only need to exchange money with us today and we will give you as much as you want.
This is a big pit, and I am an example of life insurance being cheated. When my brain was in motion, I exchanged more than a hundred thousand dollars.
The price he gave me has many problems. 70,000 yuan does not include the cost of water and electricity reform, does not include any doors and cabinets, and these three are the basic costs.
In addition to their service fees, their fees are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost confidence in this company, and I don't know what to do.
When I went to find them, they acted very experienced and had a special team to deal with you.
Either way, it is the customer's problem.
Different types of repossession, there are many details, I don't want to say it's all tears, in the end, you shouldn't choose them, because the house my friends found to repair is also of poor quality and will cost you later.
The dragon robes are the clothes of the swindlers. Now they have become beautiful, as if they have become other things.
Therefore, everyone should choose such a renovation company.
Afterwards, everyone looked at these questions because the renovation was not cheap.
If you want to ask the merchant, please login or register first.

For your convenience, we provide you with the latest merchant information, such as the address, phone number, business hours, etc., of the clothing repair and design channel in Kunming, so that you can find the clothing repair and design company and repair your clothes.
So scary, cancel the order in 30 minutes!
Is there any other way? Like changing the address?
Fortunately, you don't cancel this conversation. If you don't pay me for 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue you.
Is it possible to cancel after 15 minutes?

The starry sky has about 2,000 double stars that will arrive on the 14th - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomy experts said that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will arrive in a grand manner on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe it after midnight on the same day.
On December 13, 2018, astronomy lovers in Beijing took a photo of the double zodiacal cloud in Qinghai.
Most of the parent stars of the meteor shower are Jupiter, but the mother star of the double-star meteor shower is a 3200-number small asteroid, which is an Abell-type small asteroid.
The Twin Pulsar is currently the second known pulsar that is not "hatched" by a star.
Tianjin Astronomical Association president and astronomy specialist Liu Xueliang said that as with the lunar eclipse, the double star usually occurs at the end of life, and the "eclipse period" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is called the Northern Hemisphere's three major meteor showers.
One prominent feature of the double-star nebula is that the speed of the celestial body is slower, the color is rich, and there are many fire stars. It is suitable for beginners to take pictures of astronomy and astrophotography.
On December 13, 2020, Tianjin astronomy lovers Yang Ying filmed a double star in the constellation Gemini in Tianjin.
Astronomical forecast shows that this year's Geminid meteor shower will arrive at its peak on December 14 (around 15:00 local time), with a ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, the radiation point is located at the top of the head, and the number of meteors seen per hour) of 150.
The two-child policy recommends the number of stars.
Last year, the twin stars of "falling stars" left a deep impression on people, but this year's twin stars of "falling stars" will be affected by the moonlight, and the degree of brilliance will be dampened.
On the 14th of November, the moon will be full moon, and the bright moonlight will make it difficult to observe, and the moon will set at the end of the night. At the same time, the radiation point of the twin stars will also rise higher.
Friends who like to watch the meteor shower can observe it in the last quarter of the moon after midnight, but they should pay attention to preventing cold and keeping warm.
How can we observe more stars?
“It is not advisable to carry out observations in the city, but you can choose a high altitude, bright and facing east in the countryside or the suburbs, and wait patiently for the moon to set before carrying out observations.
What needs to be paid attention to is that the flow of radiation from the two pulsars in all directions is very large, and it is not necessary to continuously observe the radiation points of the two pulsars.
Friends who like photography should take pictures of the beautiful "starry sky" with a wide-angle lens and a large aperture. When shooting, use high ISO and the largest aperture.
Based on the stability and continuity of consideration, the three-legged stool, the battery and the fast-opening door must also be considered.
Peng Shuiliang said.
What are the differences between LED TVs and traditional TVs in the market?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the author should be a liquid crystal TV, while the difference between the plasma TV and the liquid crystal TV in the market is mainly two points:
First, the laser TV concentrates the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of liquid crystal TV, the market positioning of laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market, or it can be said that laser TV itself is a large-screen product.
At present, the mainstream size of liquid crystal TVs is 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of plasma TVs is generally above 75 inches, meeting the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of global sales and sales of LED TVs has been continuously increasing, accounting for more than six percent of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the prediction of China Hi-Tech Group, in 2020, the sales of the laser TV market will grow by more than 140%, and will continue to maintain a high growth rate.
The excellent performance of the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of LCD TVs in protecting the eyes.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV cartoon reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eye, which is closer to the imaging process under natural conditions than the backlight of the liquid crystal TV, and the stimulus generated by the eye is also smaller.
China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute and Beijing Eye Hospital ophthalmology experts, through strict comparative experiments under the same conditions, obtained 144 test data.
Data verification: Infrared TV has a very strong protective function, and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
In the current situation where vision health is becoming more and more important, LCD TVs are not only attracting more and more users because of their eye protection advantages, but also opening up another breakthrough in the color market.
The second is to focus on the high-end market.
With the continuous decline in liquid crystal TV prices, the price of fluorescent TVs sold in the market has exceeded 10,000 yuan, and as the size and light source are upgraded, the price gradually rises.
What is the value of the photoelectric television?
It is definitely rational.
Under the continuous development of light source and technology, the advantages of liquid crystal TVs and projection cannot be achieved.
Based on the short focal distance projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is relatively shorter than that of the traditional projection equipment. It can achieve a 100-inch screen experience within a short distance, and the space required is not large, and the host is small and takes up little space.
In terms of brightness, large-size brand LED TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the lower the temperature, the lower the power consumption of the equipment, and the longer the life of the TV.
In addition, many high-end LCD TV models also carry many front-end technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition pictures, artificial intelligence systems, and holographic screens, which can bring more exciting visual and audio experiences to users.
It is not a fake need, but a need for fine-tuned products. It is a matter of quality and input and output ratios, and it is not a game for the cinema. If you want to watch a big screen and the environment is not good, you can try, everything has its benefits and disadvantages, and you can judge for yourself. Don't be afraid of listening to the other side.
In simple terms, the super-wide-angle lens is close to the projector - the laser TV, in order to get close to the screen, it is necessary to use expensive super-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which does not conform to the best optical design.
In order to block some environmental lights, the price of the phosphor screen is high, and the price of the 80-inch screen is basically equivalent to that of the 65-inch liquid crystal.
There is one more thing I want to talk about. I particularly dislike the idea of the projection factory selling comics reflecting on the eyepiece. It is not a good selling point. The light on the cloth on the eyepiece is a direct light to the eyepiece, and the eyepiece does not see it. Do you need a liquid crystal TV to open the TV flower?
Moreover, if the projection screen cloth is not a cartoon reflection, it is not a cartoon.
Just like the blind spot (blind spot) is ignored, a lot of light is reflected back to the eye, which is really difficult.
Photography Exhibition Gallery selects quality stores
After adding the WeChat reminder date, the little sister arranged the time for me to choose and sent it to me. The return message was timely.
Before seeing the photos in the store, there were more wedding photos taken outside, which were very beautiful and involved many different shooting styles.
After exchanging ideas with my sister, I was very persistent in helping me try out my own style of dressing, and finally decided to start the photo shoot. The photographer took some props, guided the action, and paid attention to every detail.
But it may be that because I don't have a specific shooting style with you, the style that you shoot is not what I want, but it should be a good look.
After shooting, the photographer will help select photos, and the atmosphere will be more relaxed.
It takes about half a month to improve the quality of the film, which is equivalent to sitting.
The second time there was a photo-taking event of the king's feast ~ most of the participants could choose a photo.
Finally, I chose a black skirt and experienced a different style.
The entire shooting process took about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting, and the photographer was a 95-year-old brother. He felt a little green and hoped to give more suggestions after guiding the customer to take pictures. The shooting process was relatively fast.
Photography Exhibition Gallery Exhibits Excellent Quality Products
On the first page, I also saw Queenie~
After filling in the telephone number, you can choose the clothes, and you can choose the wedding dress. After changing three or four sets of clothes, the service attitude is also very good. Afterwards, you can teach you how to pose, which is very natural. It takes half a month to get it, and it feels like it's the same as the original.
The environment is still good.
There are many choices.
The number of cosmetic stores is not much different from that of photography studios.
The service is very enthusiastic and meticulous.
The sculptor is persistent.
The photographer will also teach you how to move.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to compensate.
Experience: It is possible that the shape is a bit overdone. Originally, the two eyepieces were replaced with three eyepieces.
The eyebrows have also been trimmed, which is a bit strange for daily life without eyebrows.
The photo came out the next day, but the P photo effect was not satisfactory. It felt that the two eyes were still very obvious.
Because I didn't know what style to choose, I tried two styles. The result was a surprise. I also chose a black evening gown. The little girl said that this is a classic retro style.
After choosing the right underwear, I started to do my makeup. The makeup artist and the hairstylist were extremely patient in helping me do my makeup.
After the makeup was done, the photographer began to take pictures. The whole process was very smooth and natural.
After completing the film, I carefully selected four of my favorite scenes. My little brother said that there were 15 scenes in the film. The ending was very satisfactory.
I haven't returned yet... Because your system can't recognize my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG plus monthly payment plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay
Now I have to pay shipping costs every time
Is it possible to pay first and then deduct my monthly fee?
Small hail buys insurance, does it?
Small hail is an online insurance platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the "Measures for the Administration of Insurance Companies (2015 Revision)" suggested by the Insurance Regulatory Commission, to become an insurance company, it must meet three key words: shareholders, the person who initiated the establishment, has no major criminal record in the past three years, and has a minimum capital of RMB 50 million and must pass the approval of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In fact, these three are very difficult. In the end, it is a matter of strength. It is necessary to pass the approval of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council, and the shareholders need to have a good operating style. As a small hail insurance company, the hail insurance is legal and legitimate. In fact, there are three doors. It is not what the insurance company can achieve.
On this point, it is worth trusting.
From the perspective of insurance products, hail insurance is a kind of insurance supermarket, and many companies' stars are sold on this platform, such as the latest and top-of-the-line Thai Super 5 reinsurance, which is just a third-party intermediary.
From the perspective of the payment model, the products of the Internet platform are generally priced at a higher level than the traditional products, because at least the operating costs of the business network nodes and the cost of businessmen are included in the price of the Internet products, and the payment method is flexible and supports monthly payments, reducing the burden of insurance premiums on businessmen, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is also very good.
We can consider.
From the perspective of professionalism: This is very important, because the insurance industry is a highly professionalized industry, and many Internet products customers can self-insure. This will lead to many errors, and in the field of health and professionalism, non-insurance professionals will often add their own subjective judgments when insuring, thinking that they are healthy or compliant, which is easy to lead to many errors. There is a risk of being rejected.
I have done insurance phone sales in "Tencent Micro Insurance" (and the same as the small hail, it is an Internet insurance knowledge platform).
The protection of the Internet is real, but it is also deceitful. The Internet channel does not have professional professionals, and there are many false sales guides.
For example: 1-year insurance premium of 600,000 yuan, buy insurance and send a mobile phone, get 60,000 yuan of subsidy, these marketing strategies are correct, but they are too light, they do not tell the insurance company, and in the first month of the first year, there are more than 10 and less than 200, many customers who have paid for two years themselves do not understand.
In order to save 100 yuan, the insurance company sued for 60 million yuan (the world's largest loss).
Free delivery of mobile phones, such as 6666 and 8888, are only sent to special numbers such as 6666, 8888. If you send a lottery message, you do not exchange, and no one reminds you.
For the protectionist, this is a pitfall. The subsidy is only 600,000 yuan. It is short-term. If there is no other business risk, a million can really happen. 600,000 can solve the problem. After that, life will be better.
At present, the guidance on the sale of Internet insurance is also misleading.
Therefore, from a comprehensive perspective, there is no problem with the platform, and there is no problem with the product. The problem is the professionalism and professionalism of business operators.
It is suggested that the theme master considers carefully, and in fact, the products of insurance companies are more diversified, and customers can choose more opportunities and more products, and some products' prices are even better than Internet products.
I have helped more than 59 online customers myself, ensuring the production under the line, and guaranteeing that each person can consume about 2,000-3,000 yuan a year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I am an insurance agent with more than three years of experience in enterprise management training. I have served more than 1,000 enterprises. I have cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insuring, I will start from the needs of customers and customize insurance products for them. During insuring, I will try my best to get the best insurance premium for customers. After insuring, I will help customers to settle insurance claims, manage insurance premiums, and let customers rest assured.
Grow with each customer forever.
I hope my answer can help the topic!
According to the definition of the Insurance Regulatory Department, Internet insurance refers to the insurance business completed by the insurer after clicking on the insurance network link.
In this process, no signatures are required for the protection person, and no signatures are required for the insurance advisor. All steps can be completed by the protection person themselves.
Although the protection of Internet security does not have a "ceremony feeling", even the printable quality agreement may not be printed, but it does not affect the validity and legal force of the electronic version of the contract.
This mode is somewhat similar to the general flow of "telephone sales", but there is a fatal problem in buying insurance. That is, the subsequent service may not match.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for several decades. When we buy insurance, are we really thinking carefully about it? Is the "intermediary" we choose one that can be our long-term partner and provide services to us even after many years?
That's how I contacted the delivery specialist
It is already 3 o'clock.
That is not compensation for me
I said to send the goods
But the horse was put at the door, and then people went away
Still wrong
Your horse has already taken me abroad, but it is still waiting to be notified
The horse has received my foreign trade at 19:25, but it has not yet departed.
If I buy it, do I have to buy it from other foreign sales?
What to do
Where did your horse go?
Is there anything else?
I am to send

Returning to honor the code
There is no problem, remember that there is no need to arrange, I have bought elsewhere, I don't want to waste
Thank you for your help
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of vilification and slander, and I cannot accept such behavior.
In a civilized society, we can accept everything, but we must reject this kind of evil.
If you do not look at the party and faction, it is a kind of uncivilized behavior.
From the time you started to send me a face book message, you added me as a friend, then you posted a card with a seductive message, and finally, when you tried to publish my alleged home address and father's name on social media, I took an unresponsive attitude.
You have changed so much that you have continued to tag me even though you only eat six meals a day. More importantly, your so-called friends continue to talk about me behind my back without any remorse about my embarrassing and shameful remarks, my appearance, my lifestyle, whether I smoke marijuana or not, and so on.
Afterwards, I received a lot of friends who sent me a message with a photo of you and a portion of your comments.
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can't continue to be silent.
After the news of my arrest was uploaded, you did not apologize, but instead became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, and I don't care what your identity is. In our society, we need to respect both sides.
In fact, you can continue to make such provocative remarks, you can continue to say that you only love and care about me, you can continue to think that this is not a riot, you can even continue to deny that it is not your drawing or continue to publish all attacking remarks.
That's right, I can't and I can't stop you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My style and character do not need your comments.
I even do not think that there is any woman who is willing to let others insult her in such a way.
A friend asked me, is it still good?
I say, you will not believe.
I feel that even if no woman is humiliated, I can still say that I am good.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic integrity will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that the road is in the heart of the people.
I deleted some comments for everyone to review
Your reply should not be overwhelming
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.
The heart laughs
Vietnamese people's network - Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh to attend the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Forum
The forum on the development of Vietnamese digital technology enterprises was held in two sessions during the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum. The two sessions discussed the topics of digital technology enterprises and the country's digital transformation and digital technology enterprises and the new coronavirus epidemic situation and economic recovery and development after the epidemic.
Ruan Mengxiong, director of the Communications and Media Department, said that although the epidemic situation of the new coronavirus has continued to spread in 2021, the number of Vietnamese digital technology enterprises and their business income have continued to increase, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam has grown rapidly, focusing on solving major difficulties facing Vietnam, and many digital products have gone out of the country, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has improved.
Ruan Mengxiong, Party Secretary of Ruan Mengxiong, called on digital enterprises to take on the responsibility of developing the digital transformation platform for developing countries, and that developing these countries' digital platforms is the responsibility of the country.
On the forum, leaders from various departments and countries are studying, developing, applying, and transferring digital enterprises, organizations, and individuals to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, together with promoting the country's digital transformation, and breakthrough and innovative ideas and solutions such as the revitalization of the economy after the Zhu Ruiqiang incident.
In his speech at the forum, Fan Changsheng stressed that digital transformation is the inevitable road for the world and the visible demand for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services need to be provided to the whole population.
People and enterprises are the core, body, target and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies must be for the people and enterprises.
Fan Changsheng stressed that the digital transformation needs to show national spirit, rely on internal strength as the main, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, and rely on external forces as important and breakthrough points.
At the same time, he believes that the digital transformation needs to drive in-depth development and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of new coronavirus pneumonia, economic recovery and development, address its after-effects, overcome the depletion of natural resources, and promote the development of green transformation and green energy.
The digital transformation needs to participate in the establishment of databases on the protection and popularization of national cultural values, traditional culture, national ecological environment and other data, and promote the digital transformation of banking, taxation, land management and development, and logistics.
The greatest goal of digital transformation is to make the people more happy and the country more prosperous and powerful.
Fan Changsheng, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, demanded that all levels of government, all levels of departments and enterprises should increase their leading and guiding role in the development of digital technology, improve their recognition of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve the system of digital transformation, strengthen the country's governance ability and promote the development of digital technology enterprises on the basis of respect, communication, listening, active and proactive.
During the forum, Fanming attended the awarding ceremony of the 2021 "Made in Vietnam" Excellent Digital Product Award and the opening ceremony of the "Made in Vietnam" Digital Product Exhibition.

The surroundings are not what they seem. The five-star hotel is empty, and the hotel cuisine is mediocre.
This elevator is also very shocking, just like the big disease, it is second to second, and it is very shocking. I go to the floor I want to go to from the safety channel, and I go straight to the furniture store. The furniture store closes the door, and the safety channel does not go out!
The house is still in need of improvement, and many places have not developed.
Address: No. 555, Beijing North Railway Station, convenient transportation, large parking lot, free in the morning.
Environment: In fact, the store is very spacious. There are 8-9 floors in the house. The furniture, appliances and various small appliances that the family wants to buy are all available. There are many brand stores in the store. There are too many brands to remember. It is a good place to buy products. It is a good place to rest.
Recently, I wanted to buy a comfortable sandal, and my friends said there are many sandals here to choose from. I looked at the house, the kitchen, and the master bedroom, and I felt that I could afford it. The price is a little expensive, so I am still hesitating.
For your convenience, we provide the latest merchant information, such as high-speed rail home address, telephone number, business hours, and so on, to help you find clothing and shoe repair companies.
I have sent my customers to #PRS_ORG, but it does not work.
After all, after all
If it can be sent within 20 minutes, it will not be canceled.
The realization of the green comprehensive service area on the Yangtze River-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Cheng) The green comprehensive service zone on the Huanghe River in Chongqing was put into operation on the 10th as scheduled. This is the second green comprehensive service zone on the Yangtze River after the green comprehensive service zone in Yichang, Hubei Province, was put into operation on the 4th.
At present, the green comprehensive service area on the water has covered the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qin Jianhua, deputy director of the Transportation Department of the Yangtze River Administration, said that previously, 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas have been established in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces, which have been recognized by the ship crew and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze shipping.
The full coverage of the green service area on the water is another milestone in the construction of the green channel of the Yangtze River. The Yangtze shipping fleet has significantly improved its ability to receive and provide shipping services.
According to the introduction, the green comprehensive service zone on the water is to provide comprehensive production and life services for ships and ship crew, and help ship crew solve the "urgent and difficult" problem.
The two sides of the Yangtze River cruise that has been put into operation will integrate life services, production services and government services into a whole, with green environmental protection as the main theme, and with ship repair and emergency rescue services as the characteristics, so as to achieve the goal of making ship workers more efficient and convenient in their work on the Yangtze River.
The three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China, the strongest weapon in the world is unlikely to visit the island 2022-01-17 Diversified reports: China-U.S. relations latest news: The latest satellite image shows that the three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering in China; the U.S. media also reported that one of the strongest weapons in the U.S. Navy is unlikely to visit the island, sending an important signal to allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the information of the China Smart Brain "Nanhai Strategic Situation Awareness Platform", on January 9, the satellite discovered the US "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform estimates that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the F-35C fighter aircraft and the CMV-22 "Osprey" transport aircraft on the "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier.
Now the US aircraft carrier that is cruising in the Pacific, in addition to the "Carl Vinson" number, there is also the "Abraham Lincoln" number (USS Abraham Lincoln) that left the United States on January 3.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft, belonging to the 314th attack squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy is also stationed in the "Ronald Reagan" (USS Ronald Reagan) aircraft carrier in Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Soviet Lake" missile cruiser and the "Striketer" missile destroyer.
On January 17, 2022, the latest satellite image of the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" was released, showing that three US aircraft carriers were gathering around China.
（Weibo@南海战略状况感知） The three US aircraft carriers gather in the South China Sea, the strongest weapon inaccessible to the island. On January 17, 2022, the US military transport aircraft CMV-22B flew a route.
According to the US-based Cable News Network (CNN) on the 17th, the strongest weapon in the US Navy's arsenal unexpectedly visited the island last week.
Carrying 20 Trident missile launchers and dozens of nuclear warheads, the Russian nuclear submarine "Nevada" entered the US military base in the Pacific Ocean on Saturday (January 15).
The three aircraft carriers of the US, Japan, and India are gathering in the vicinity of the strongest weapons in China. According to analysis, this is a signal sent by allies and enemies in the tense situation of India-Pacific.
This is the first visit to the island by a US aircraft carrier since 2016 and the second public visit since the 1980s.
The three U.S. aircraft carriers are concentrated in the South China Sea, where the strongest weapons are rarely seen. In recent years, China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea.
The map shows China's Yongshu Island in the South China Sea.
The U.S. Navy said in the statement that the visit of the Russian nuclear-powered cruiser "Peter the Great" to the related islands strengthened the cooperation between the allies in the U.S. and the region, demonstrated the U.S. ability, vitality, state of readiness, and continuing commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
The missile submarine is usually called the "boomer submarine" (Boomer submarine).
In the US Navy fleet of 14 "Falcon" submarines, the track is usually strictly confidential.
Around the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile, the "secret weapon" becomes the "most important survival weapon" in the nuclear triad. This system also includes the missile silos in the United States and the bombers such as B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Following the rise of Meta by 26%, its market value soared by 25.1 billion US dollars. Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is a marketing company in essence. Its main income comes from advertising, which is the advertising company that makes money today. It has its own flow channel.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and other functions are all Meta's flow channel.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", and many Apps outside Meta advertise through the advertising platform of Meta.
However, the times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta can no longer obtain user data information, which has affected the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users, and it is very obvious to suggest whether users allow the App to obtain their information. The normal response of most people is definitely not to allow.
If Google adds another knife, the impact on Meta's income will be even greater.
Second, the growth of Meta's income in the past has also weakened the Chinese factor (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it definitely exists).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual income comes from China, mainly from the contributions of Chinese companies engaged in maritime business.
Meta is about 100 people in Hong Kong's office, and there are still many agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is an indispensable advertising channel.
It is worth mentioning that the TT of the current festival is one of the main competitors of Meta, but in the past two years, Meta has earned a lot of money from the festival.
All domestic representatives are helping to promote ads on Meta, and the performance of the Chinese region of Meta is also very good.
I haven't specialized in it, but I'm sure it won't be worse.
Chinese companies have passed the stage of large-scale losses overseas.
Third, the expansion of new flow channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting old, and new platforms such as TT are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market is not only looking at current income, but also looking at future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are too high.
In order to tell the new story to the market, Zhao Xiaoguang told the story of "Elementary Space".
It is undoubtedly one of the directions of the future, but the realization cycle of Elements is relatively long. This story should not be able to support the value of Meta in the next three years.
Therefore, the next two years will be a difficult period for Meta.
Facebook is now in a very bad situation. It has an annual income of 100 billion to 200 billion dollars, which is actually very risky. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, it has no good security wall.
Although his initial social softwares are now popular, they are also mainstream social softwares such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but faced with the rapid development of TikTok, FaceBook also has no confidence.
It is a pity that such a promising concept has failed completely in such a short time, so the risk of face-to-face is very high. This is also the fundamental reason for his change of company and his constant pursuit of new games. But I think his choice of games is wrong. It is more than one of my thoughts and suggestions for reference.
