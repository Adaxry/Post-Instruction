Is there a way to punish him?
To avoid such a situation again
Or does the restaurant have to be ready for a long time? Can you help me ask?
The students at the University of Zhejiang sang the lead in the annual meeting of academic year. The research results opened people's minds. - Xinhua
To wash your hands with air, you can judge the disease by your breath, and precisely search for the source of fog and smog. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year of Zhejiang University, a series of brilliant academic achievements were honored.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. Their research covers a wide range of fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical, life science and humanities education. From a curious idea, they have created a number of high-end inventions with great application value, some of which have won awards in China and abroad.
Biological sensors: Your home medical doctor
Zhang Diqiang, a doctoral student in the School of Biological and Medical Engineering, showed a biological sensor on the mobile phone side, which is half the size of a smartphone.
You just need to breathe gently, and this equipment can first detect your health status from your breath.
Zhang Diqiang said that this sensor is connected to the smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the smartphone after exhaling gas.
The market for smart wristbands that can test health is generally testing physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This biological sensor uses a new material, graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its keen sense of smell allows it to more accurately reflect a person's health status at a deeper level.
Intelligent surgical light: doctor's high energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights have also been used in the operating room.
The invention won the silver medal at the 44th Geneva International發明展 this year.
The Ph.D. students Zhu Lin靖 and Song Junfei team opened a new way in the defects of traditional surgical light and invented an intelligent LED surgical shadow light.
"Many diseases are not detected and removed at an early stage, which is related to the light in the operating room of the doctor."
Jin Junfei said, for example, in the early detection of cancer, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cell will spread.
This intelligent surgical light has four light plates, through the adjustment of the spectrum, to enhance the differentiation of different organs in the light.
In the course of the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadow rate of the light spot according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical light has been tested in the affiliated邵逸夫医院 and affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical School, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: save water and cool
To wash your hands, you just need to take a shower, put on a little soap, and squeeze some hand sanitizer. But some of your classmates have invented an "airhand sanitizer".
Our weight can be compressed out of the air if we stand on the toilet of the device.
It is like a gasoline tank.
The compressed air is formed into a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
So we can wash our hands clean! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiment prove that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device can only rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure the cleanliness and save 91% of water, and the whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, this invention was distinguished in the second Global Major Challenges Summit, and won the only gold medal.
Please arrange for me to be reimbursed as soon as possible, thank you.
Please cancel the order and return the cash, don't get points, and never use #PRS_ORG# again!
Fat and spicy pickled vegetables are not suitable for children
If so, please order as soon as possible
No, thank you.
He asked me to tell you where he is. #PRS_ORG#
I don't wait anymore, cancel the order
I bought it, but I wrote the wrong address
Can you change?
Cancel order
Okay, sorry.
This certificate is meaningful to me.
This is one of the skills certificates that I feel is most important besides my driving license.
普及一下：急救措施其实是做突发事件时的应急救援，即在救护车来之前抢救。
It is well known that in the process of the ambulance coming, there is actually a certain period of time, and this period of time is the most important.
At this time, it is necessary for emergency treatment.
If I really have a heart attack, a stroke, or a sudden death, our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, people around me know how important it is to know how to save a life.
When we see someone falling down, we can use professional knowledge to rescue him, rather than being helpless and unable to do anything, which is so scary.
In China, we have 300 million unexpected deaths every year, and the most dangerous are heart attacks.
In the United States, 15% of people can be saved.
In Las Vegas casinos, 80% can be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%."
This is the first reaction founder Lu Le said.
If a person has a heart arrest, breathing has stopped, heartbeat has stopped, and you press on the middle finger is no use.
It is necessary to do artificial breathing and chest pressure to rescue the person.
I found that very few people now have such awareness to learn emergency response, but when the situation happens, it is too late, so I call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond to the emergency situation in time.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
Emergency permits can be registered at the local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. Students also have discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals that he had to complete before the age of 25, and the addition of the emergency permit to the list was months ago, but it has actually been completed!
Next, I have to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I have seen a diving rescue certificate in the past. It seems that a diving rescue certificate is necessary to take this certificate. So, in fact, a diving rescue certificate is very useful!
I ordered #number#
Among them, 13 yuan is one!
I've never tried
How does #NAME# not write clearly?
One 13 yuan?
Yesterday, the #PRS_ORG# forgot the meal, and this time, I ate a shrimp dumpling!
Because I saw that the code was effective before I input it.
First of all, let's talk about the conclusion. I personally think that "Far and Away" is a complete piece of garbage.
But if you say that the movie is not a highlight, then it is not a highlight at least the score is good.
There are many kinds of bad films, one of which is to make you fall asleep in the cinema, one of which is to make you angry after you have watched it, and "Far and Away" is like a monkey in the mountain of Shaolin, which can use countless ways to ignite your anger.
In terms of insulting the audience, Kang Cailian is truly gifted.
The film's most painful thing is that it seems like a creation in the K系 novel, difficult to name, and with many holes, like a coat of arms on the small馬哥身上。
Even after you have watched it, you will doubt whether there is a hidden metaphor in it. But when you think carefully, it turns out to be just a pile of shit.
First of all, I am very difficult to understand some scenes.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south of the country.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the scene was arranged for a grandpa to drive a small面包车 to take her to the Northeast to see snow.
Old people sit on a bread truck from the south to the north to see the snow?
He and his father are very relieved.
Then the old man disappeared.
Opening a hotel on a derelict ship, how did the main character get his business license?
Why can the gang of bikers on the island easily get the road closed?
Then a truck delivering steel bars to the middle of the road stopped at the roadside, and the truck drivers couldn't find it.
This effect is too obvious.
Why did a small delinquent with poor credit and a criminal suspicion become a deputy?
In the movie, the police even asked whether there were any difficulties?
An adult knows how to use a smart phone, but does not know how to use a hotel key to open the door, and then how to find the hotel owner and sleep in the room?
This inexplicable situation is all over the film, and since the plot is too ridiculous, I will feel pain when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, the film's main purpose, or this film has no main purpose, is a hideous seamless monster.
At the beginning of the film, you think he wants to make a comedy, but after more than 20 minutes, you think it may be an inspiring film. At the halfway point, you think it may be an inspiring film to reflect on the difficult life of the small town youth. After watching the film, you don't know what you have seen at all. The next thing is a deep doubt on yourself. Why did you go to the cinema to watch the fart?
For most people, they are quite familiar with the filming techniques of various films. For example, if you want to film a motorcyclist, you must be inspired + comedy and tell the audience a talented junior how to achieve success step by step.
If you want to shoot a love film, you should tell the truth about the enmity between the young town youth and the maid girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot must not present anything incompatible with the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that was just burned, and then could sing the role that was watched by Kennedy) cannot go to open some mind-boggling questions.
As for the female lead, who is obviously not mentally handicapped, can act like a five-year-old child in certain aspects, I don't know whether this is the reason for the performance or the requirements of the director.
And another thing I don't understand is why is so passionate to add a crash scene in his own movie?
Such a film arrangement is in the Chinese New Year period, is it for the audience to make a fuss?

Surgeon in South Africa: Omikran's ability to spread is strong, but most cases are mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the new variant of the coronavirus are milder than those caused by Delta variant, although its transmission speed is faster.
According to a report by the United States news agency, with the spread of the variant of the virus in South Africa, a doctor's organization of more than 5,000 doctors in the town of Houten in South Africa reported that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients treated at the moment are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to the symptoms of the flu.
The head of the organization, Dr. Unben Pillay, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but no one is in need of hospitalization.
皮莱说：“他们可以在家控制疾病，大多数人在隔离10至14天内康复。 ”
It includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to fall into a critical condition due to the coronavirus infection, he said.
He said that compared with the previous wave of Delta virus, the new coronavirus patients treated by him "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen level.
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days."
Two weeks after the first report of the emergence of the Omisika variant, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although collecting enough data takes weeks, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases of South Africa: Only 30% of the new coronavirus patients who were hospitalized in recent weeks were severe cases, half of the proportion of severe cases in the first wave of the pandemic; the average length of hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the recent coronavirus patients died, while the death rate in the early outbreak of cases in South Africa was 20%.
William Hanekom, head of the African Health Research Institute, cited data from the National Institute of Health and other reports as follows: "At present, almost all signs point to a mild disease."
He also said: "Now it's early, we need late data.
In general, the time of hospitalization and death is late, and we entered this outbreak only two weeks ago. "
At the same time, scientists from all over the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of the current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the main new coronavirus variant in the world, the outbreak of Omikran has occurred in dozens of countries, including South Africa as the epicenter of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases in Hodgen in the first week of December increased by 400%, and the tests showed that the Omiyaken variant accounted for more than 90% of the cases.

Education Commentary: How to rescue the kidnapped child?
If the famous publicity slogan of "no trade without killing," then, in the good environment without the demand for "rescue," the prevention and control of trafficking will make the trafficking activities unprofitable, risky, and costly, and such crimes will not happen again and again.
Recently, the Child失踪信息紧急发布平台 of the Public Security Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is the Internet information platform for the establishment of an authority channel for the release of information on the disappearance of children and the timely return of the abducted children.
As soon as I heard the name of the app, I felt so warm.
New technologies not only have the name of "artistic" and full of emotion, but also have the right use of information technology, practical and effective.
The first priority in the fight against human trafficking is to return the children abducted, and to protect their personal safety and freedom.
Secondly, the trial and punishment of the suspects are secondary.
The meaning of criminal punishment can be listed as many "great words" from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
However, before the case was solved, priority should be given to the safety of the victim.
It depends on the importance of the matter and the urgency of the "rescue" purpose. Such controversial and disputed topics, such as whether "trafficking children should be sentenced to death", can be temporarily put aside and discussed cautiously; but the rescue of the child should not wait.
According to the experience of the investigation of such cases, the human traffickers usually leave the crime scene after getting away.
If the search and rescue operation takes one minute longer, the child may be further away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case increases by one point.
In this case, taking out effective measures such as the "团圆" platform, which directly helps to solve the case and find the child, is a practical action.
In the end, "trafficking in persons" is a great task that needs to be done in the whole legal system.
In order to combat crime and safeguard the rights and interests of children and their parents, it is not only necessary to improve the legislation, but also to ensure the legal protection of children.
In addition, prevention of child trafficking from family to society can be done better.
For example, a common case, a family of three stopped at the railway station, their parents were asleep, and when they woke up, they found that their child had disappeared.
It is not possible to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have some protection awareness.
Parents can take breaks, or put their children in a safe place, to prevent them from being taken.
From the other side of the crime of trafficking in children, the side that buys the child should also be concerned and punished.
Single illegal acts often only one part of a long chain.
According to China's "刑法", the法定刑起刑点 is 5 years; if the crime is particularly serious, it can reach the death penalty and be subject to confiscation of property.
The penalty point is high and the maximum penalty is heavy, so the trafficking of children clearly belongs to the punishment of the heaviest crime under the trend of "light punishment."
There are still many trafficking cases every year.
It can be seen that some people have a backward concept of raising children and a weak awareness of the law.
The law education of this group should be synchronized with it.
It is not enough to rely on the strict enforcement of official law.
If the "market" is widely present, the traffickers are greedy, constantly innovate the trafficking methods, and form a "competition with law enforcement" situation, the trafficking action will inevitably fall into the ineffective muddle.
Therefore, breaking down the backward ideas, popularizing legal knowledge, and also helping to root out the trafficking and buying of children will also help.
Yang Hongdong promulgated the spirit of the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the provincial Party Conference
From the 100-year struggle history of the Party, we can draw inspiration
Hunan Daily News, December 10 (full media reporter Guochuan Wang) According to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, on the morning of the 12th day of the month, Yang Hongdong, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and the Minister of Propaganda of the Provincial Party Committee, made interactive lectures in the video and cultural creative park of Ma Anshan, and studied in depth the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC National Congress, the spirit of the important instructions and directives of General Secretary Xi Jinping to Hunan, and the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress.
Yu Hengdong, from the three aspects of ideal beliefs, initial mission, and self-revolution and the youth party, party leaders and party theory, combined with his own feelings and personal experiences, he comprehensively and systematically explained the core meanings and practical requirements of the Party's spirit.
He pointed out that it is necessary to combine the spirit of the full meeting with the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and instructions, and integrate and comprehend the spirit of the provincial party congress, so as to strengthen the ideological consciousness, political consciousness, and action consciousness in upholding the "establishment of the two" and achieving the "retention of the two", and unswervingly move forward in the direction of General Secretary Xi Jinping's instructions.
At the interactive exchange session, the representative of grass-roots cadres, the representative of enterprises, and the representative of young people put forward questions on the relationship between the three historic resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of “two established”, how cultural enterprises can grasp the direction, and how the young people in the new era can learn from the 100-year party history.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil). There are five levels.
Raw olive oil or natural olive oil is the oil obtained directly from the fresh olive fruit after mechanical cold pressing, filtration and other treatments.
According to the acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Extra Virgin): is the highest level and quality of olive oil, is pure natural products.
The taste is excellent, with a pleasant scent of plants and a pH of less than 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil (Fine Virgin): The acidity is slightly high, but not more than 2%, and the taste is pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil (Ordinary Virgin): taste and flavor are acceptable, and the acidity is not more than 3.3%.
refined olive oil refers to refined olive oil, which is obtained by refining olive oil with a pH of more than 3.3%, or becomes a "second oil".
The refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Extra Virgin Olive Oil): Extra Virgin Olive Oil is refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil, to adjust the taste and color, its acidity is less than 1.5%, and it is yellow in color.
Refined olive pomace oil or refined olive pomace oil (Refined Olive Pomace Oil): It is obtained by dissolving method from the pomace oil and refining.
You should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is an important indicator.
It is important to know that olives come from different vineyards and different olive varieties, and produce different standards of olive oil.
The best growing place for olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for the growth of olive trees.
In addition to the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be planted sporadically.
Major production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc. are also similar to the climate.
The harvest month of olive oil:
Every year, from March to June, the olive tree blooms, and from July to October, the fruit develops and matures. The fruit transitions from green to red, purple, and eventually turns black.
The fruit harvest season is from November to February next year.
Oil's nutritional content:
Oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, including oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Oil is considered the most suitable oil for human nutrition to date.
The democratic summit ended, Biden said that the flame of freedom will never die
The online "Democracy Summit" convened by the US President Biden and attended by leaders of governments and citizens and the private sector in more than 110 countries ended on Friday (12th October).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom was burning in the hearts of all people around the world, and the專制政權 would never be able to put it out.
He also said that he plans to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
On the second day of the summit, Taiwanese government representative and civil affairs commissioner唐凤和 also spoke at the summit.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work we face is.
But we also know that we can face challenges, because as I said before, the world of democracy is everywhere.
The專制政權永遠無法熄滅自由的微火，它在全世界和世界各地人們的心中燃燒。 "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the cooperation of the whole society.
He said: "As a leader of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the bar of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, and be more powerful to withstand the buffer and impact of authoritarianism and those who pursue power in the public interest before the public interest."
The theme of the "Democracy Summit" on the second day is to uphold human rights, consolidate democracy and fight against authoritarianism, and to counteract digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values.
This day coincides with the "International Human Rights Day".
On the same day, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Guterres, also said in his opening speech that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially the challenges brought about by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions and the resilience of democracy.
This requires deepening social dialogue, resolving inequality, combating corruption, updating social contracts, investing in high-quality education, and expanding opportunities for women.
This also requires resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including all the tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Hong Kong Democratic and Human Rights Activists羅冠聰通過事先錄製的視頻發表講話,提醒參加者持續關注香港和維吾爾族和藏族等中國少數民族的人權狀況。
He said: "Over the long term, the world has always accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold China accountable.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use all our resources (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Mr. Lo also called on the world to unite against the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose China's market, maybe some of you don't know (the Chinese Communist Party's) threat to our democratic values.
That is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason we must change. "
On the sidelines of the "Deterring Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democracy Values" round table discussion, Taiwan's Vice Premier Tran Hung Bin released the "Statement of the National Government", emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against tyranny and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience of how to fight the coronavirus through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "When Taiwan's democracy is in its infancy, we have always stood at the forefront of global anti-authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the pandemic, the authoritarian governments in all parts of the world rationalized the violations of human rights for the sake of public health and collective interests, and the global democracy showed signs of backwardness.
However, in Taiwan, we do not need to close the city to control the epidemic, and we can defeat fake information without removing it. "
At the same time as the second day of the "Democratic Summit", the US Treasury announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea and other countries that were found to have committed serious human rights violations, while imposing investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to help commit human rights violations.

I know.
But the restaurant does not know why the delivery time is being delayed
It used to be #NUMBER#
Anyway, I don't call.
Not eaten
I will definitely complain
You can't get it, so why don't you tell me?
Waiting for you so long
No, I haven't received a call

I want to cancel the order
Why not cancel
Hello, the restaurant's chicken with water is alive
I want to try tennis, but I am afraid that I will not be able to stick to it, so I want to practice for a little while at a similar price.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price often correlates with the degree of friendship. If you cannot distinguish, the normal situation of the expensive camera will be more friendly than that of the cheap camera, which is actually industrial waste.
Their strength is low, the ball hits the racket, and the vibration is very large. Hard balls cannot withstand it, and masters are very difficult to handle.
Their existence logic and hidden meaning are - tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, and you know you can't afford to buy expensive, so you make cheap things to fool you, you play twice, you won't play again, so this racket is cheap, you don't care.
When you can distinguish the good from the bad, it means that you have made progress. When you come here to buy the expensive one, I will earn twice my money.
It is suggested to buy a used racket for a similar price, and choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous, so the price of a good racket is not high. A new racket with a price of 500 and 600 is enough. A used racket with a price of 200 is not enough?
It is friendly to newbies, but after the newbie stage, it becomes useless, but most people, especially women, cannot pass the newbie stage.
Orders have been repeatedly delayed delivery time
Can you help me follow up?
Delay
Thank you
So, in fact, I already have credit?
Next, do I need to order again? Did the previous order not count?
Hello, I have ordered food from this restaurant, but the food I have ordered is missing many, and the chicken soup is also raw.

Girl donates as a target for her sister: "I thought it would be better if it were flesh wounds." - Xinhua
An 11-year-old girl stands in front of a big wooden board with the words "body meat target, 10 yuan one arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a girl from Hangzhou donating as an "arrow target" to her sister went viral on WeChat.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a big wooden board that is slightly taller than people. On the board, there are words such as "people's flesh targets, 10 yuan for a shot", indicating that after paying, people can use arrows to shoot.
The behavior triggered a lot of discussion on the Internet.
Last night, the person in charge of the Propaganda Department of the Pudong Sub-district Police Department of the杭州市公安局 confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police had confirmed that the girl was the sister who had made such extreme actions, but such actions were not worthy of promotion. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girls on the street are warned to donate
The picture on the Internet shows a girl with long hair standing in front of a large wooden board with the words "people's flesh targets, 10 yuan for a shot" written in black ink on the board, and another wooden board with her bank account and WeChat and Alipay accounts written there.
The picture on the Internet has caused controversy.
Some netizens believed that this was a "bobbing behavior", and many netizens expressed sympathy for it.
We found the situation when we patrolled to the square around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd, and the number of spectators had already increased. "
In an interview with local media, a police officer at Miashi Police Station near the incident said that there were two girls who were selling at the stall, both of whom were in their 20s and looked young.
Among them, the girl who plays the role of “human target” has been crying and begging the passersby to play the game; the other girl is helping her to call and say that her friend's sister has leukemia, and she needs to have a surgery now. Please help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment. "
Last night, the person in charge of the Propaganda Department of the Pudong Sub-district Police Department of the杭州市公安局 told the Beijing News reporter that the girl was named Ji佳丽 and donated for her sister Ji佳艳.
However, because treatment still requires more than 30,000 costs, he couldn't think of a good way to raise funds, so he made such a behavior.
He said that during the whole process, the two girls were targets, and one of them was responsible for helping, but did not participate in it. During the whole process, no one shot arrows, but some people watched and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After the police verified the use of the arrows by the public security department, they did not belong to the control category.
The person in charge said, "it is not recommended to adopt such eye-catching fundraising methods."
After being warned by the police, she has left the police station.

What is the most popular in 2021?
Of course, Tokyo Olympic Games.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, there was a "Quick Look! Project Managers Can Impact Olympic Games!" article that was very popular, which mentioned that project managers are absolutely capable of taking the lead in many projects, and no one else can do it: Moving bricks, going out of town, and working late are the daily tasks of project managers, and rescuing fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are no problem.
An article that seems to be a joke, but also reveals the daily hardships of the project managers, which represents the incapability of the current project management work.
And people working in project management are gradually choosing to escape from the difficulties in their work through some actions.
According to the number of people applying for the PMP (Project Management Professional Certification), more and more project management professionals are learning to improve their project management capabilities through study.
According to the "China's 20 Years of Project Management Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the total number of PMP candidates in China has reached nearly 60 million, the number of PMP certified people has reached about 42 million, the number of effective PMPs has reached about 30 million, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMPs in the world.
Over the past 10 years, the number of PMPs has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer acceptable to rely on simple copying of the past "old experience" to do things. The瞬息万变的 working environment tells us that we need to learn to stand on the shoulders of giants and explore the way forward.
But can a PMP guarantee smooth project management?
Many project management beginners say that through learning relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten areas and five process groups related to project management, but when they actually do project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often have the following problems: The project management cognition is not in place, only relying on personal experience, having project management theories, but not knowing how to practice; There is a lack of a system of project management procedures and regulations, and it cannot be implemented in the work, the project estimate is inaccurate, the control is not sensitive, the project is delayed again and again; Members of the team are not clearly divided, the "old oil" in the team does not know how to deal with cross-functional assistance and communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to advance...
Therefore, after more than ten years of focusing on product innovation and research and development management, it has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other research and development key talents, and won the "China Enterprise Research and Development Management Talents Training Demonstration Base" and other honorary titles.
The online course of "Research Development Project Manager Training Camp" combines online fragmented learning with practical case studies, tools and methods from a number of research and development companies to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of a project manager and take your project management to the next level.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less investment to promote the training process of project managers, so as to bring more efficient operation results for enterprises.
It is not possible to rely on words alone. You can first check the opinions of other students on this course: This course not only includes the in-depth professional explanation of the course content by the China Media Group experts team (the original Huawei R&D management team), but also combines the international advanced project management methodological with the real business scenes of many well-known enterprises.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, and help the students to convert the learning content into specific work after class.

Jiaxing urged consumers to be rational before the “Double 12” event - Economic Observer Network - professional financial news website
The transaction value of the national online payment business of this year's "11.11 festival" reached RMB157.7 billion, a new high compared with previous years.
Vast amounts of discount coupons, catchy live shopping, once again make consumers shout the benefits, and this wave of consumerism, on the one hand, makes people sigh that the national consumption power is getting stronger, and on the other hand, has to be calm to think about the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer groups in the contemporary era.
In the coming days of the "Double 12", Jicai Financial Services Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jicai Financial Services") issued a rational consumption initiative, urging the general public, especially young people, to establish a good consumer awareness and consumer habits, and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the National Consumer Financial Literacy Index was 66.81, up 2.04 from 2019.
Overall, China's residents have better financial consumption performance, but show greater differences in aspects such as financial behavior and skills. They also need to further improve their basic financial knowledge level.
The financial literacy level of elderly people and young people is relatively low, and “one old and one young” will still be the focus of continuous attention in financial education; the “China Youth Debt Situation Report” released by尼尔森 and the “2019-2020 China Youth Consumer Report” released by CCTV Finance show that the young generation has great consumption potential, credit consumption has become an important way of consumption upgrading, and 86.6% of the young people are using credit products, nearly half of the young people have no debt accumulation, although the overall consumption trend of the young generation is rational, it is different from the “over-consumption” label attached to the outside world, but some young people have over-consumption, following the consumption behavior, and thus have a large financial pressure and debt risk, and even led to social problems gradually increasing. Financial enterprises should shoulder social responsibilities and make positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jicai has always committed to providing high-quality and thoughtful services to help the people build their own happy life, advocating for consumers to set up a good and correct consumption attitude, and actively responding to the call of the regulator to improve consumer awareness, especially the rational consumption consciousness of young people.
In the past few years, JTC has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge dissemination activities for young people, including university students, and has gradually nurtured young people's rational consumption concept and reasonable planning of consumption needs through cooperation with domestic top universities and other forms, helping them build rational consumption concepts, reasonable planning of consumption needs, and then help them accumulate life wealth.
On the eve of the Double 12, JTC reminded all consumers friends to establish reasonable consumption awareness and correct money views, resisting blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoiding consumption loan misconception, so as to avoid affecting personal credit and future economic life.

Vietnamese People's Daily Net - The Gulf Cooperation Council Responds to Common Challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stopover includes Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in 2017, which led to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, while having close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tension seriously affected the internal unity of the SCO, and negatively affected the economic development of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked access to the country via land, sea and air routes.
This crisis was resolved only at the Summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council in January 2021. The Gulf Cooperation Council countries have signed an agreement to move towards "stability and unity" with the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are first to try to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors by the two countries in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab countries have resolved their differences to restore their relationship with Qatar, which is necessary for the interests of all countries and regional stability, in order to deal with common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct陸路通道 between the two Gulf countries.
The 7.5-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will facilitate travel and integration of the supply chain for citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest 50 billion dollars in Oman, and two countries' enterprises signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth 3 billion dollars.
The visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to the Gulf countries coincides with the Iran and the major countries of the world negotiating a plan to save the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an Iranian nuclear agreement condemned by the Gulf countries for their inability to resolve the Iranian missile issue.
All the Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and regarded Iran's nuclear program as a threat to regional security.
All the Gulf countries believe that without solving the Iranian missile problem and without taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region, it is deficient.
Under the background of the failure of major countries and Iran's nuclear negotiations to meet the wishes of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted direct negotiations.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of regional tension.
This is one of the factors to slow down the growth of the countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The HKA Summit, to be held in the near future, will be the first HKA Summit since some member states and Qatar's dispute ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements in contributing to the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, while proposing various measures to ensure that its member countries fully cooperate to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is said to have the biggest exhaust sound in the new mountainous area!
This team has brought us this car for many men.
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini and the replacement model of Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the forklift is close to RMB200, the road tax is RMB1,200 a year, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Because it has 700 horses, how fast can you imagine?
Okay, I don't know, the data says that 0 to 100 km / h acceleration takes only 2.9 seconds, which is about when your myvi reaches 30 km / h, the other way around.
The low-slung body, the arrogant cutaway door, the huge exhaust port around the body, and the panoramic 6.5 V12 engine perfectly illustrate the style of Lamborghini.
For the description of the car, you don't need to say too much, just Google yourself, and the editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not give you!
Too much attention, where everyone is watching, it is not comfortable!
The 1km fuel cost is around RM1 (the driver doesn't care).
Practice the position of getting off and on the bus, otherwise it will be awkward (because you can't climb out of the bus and then get stuck halfway).
The engine sound is too loud, and when you get out of the car, you will suddenly be deaf. (However, it is still very fun)
The car is too big, and if it is parked in a regular parking space, it will be very narrow and very afraid of being knocked by the door of the neighbor!
It's a bit lonely because there are no competitors on the road (I told myself, not related to the owner, hahaha)
Please don't misunderstand, this video's supercar is not for sale, sorry!
If you want to film a video for your car, please contact us!
More unknown car information, The Car Guide / People's Car Journal
Affected by a car crash worth a million dollars!
The Bugatti Chiron and the Porsche 911 are believed to be well known among car enthusiasts. The Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also in the millions!
Yesterday, millions of cars crashed into each other in a matter of minutes, including the Porsche 911 and the Chiron!
See the result, it is reasonable!
Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua
The university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and values that have been accumulated over time in the development process of a university, and is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to present, the university spirit is of great importance to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the establishment of the first modern university in the world, the university has assumed a unique mission different from other social organizations, and the spirit of the university has been deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. It advocates the value concept of "honesty to help the world, righteousness to govern the world" and the patriotism of "educating the country and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming more and more obvious, and the global education competition, scientific and technological competition, and talent competition continue to intensify. As an important "supply side", the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the introduction of the "Planning for the Overall Plan for the Construction of a World-Class University and a World-Class Discipline," shows China's confidence and determination to move from a large country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, while at the same time, it also raises higher requirements for the development of universities.
How to quickly strive to enter the world list of popular universities, and how to accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having some gaps, so as to achieve "stepping on the brakes"?
In addition to the confidence in the firm goal, the confidence in the path and the confidence in the ability, colleges and universities should also fully play their three advantages: one is the after-advancements, by continuously introducing overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-renowned universities, and achieving a significant improvement in academic level and quality of education; the other is the cultural advantage, by inheriting the wisdom of the Chinese civilization for 5,000 years, promoting the development of excellent traditional cultures, so as to unite forces, shape brands, and enhance image; and the third is the institutional advantage, by giving full play to the institutional advantages of socialism, strengthening the drive for goals, gathering consensus, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for the acceleration of the school to catch up with the world's advanced level.
It is especially important to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university in one place. At the same time, all schools must show their individuality and characteristics.
The school's distinctive features should have Chinese characteristics, but also reflect its unique target positioning, educational tradition and resources.
In terms of Zhejiang University, we emphasize the following three aspects in our education: first, to emphasize the innovation and entrepreneurship talent training, so as to build a comprehensive integrated education environment that combines science and education; second, to emphasize the interdisciplinary convergence, so as to promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, so as to create a system of interdisciplinary institutional environment, so as to actively cultivate the interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and the distinctive interdisciplinary achievements; third, to emphasize the educational system and social service, so as to carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, so as to speed up the formation of a comprehensive system of cooperation between Zhejiang University and industry, academia and research.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Study, Practice, Learn, Distinguish, Persevere" and the common values of "flexibility, humility, honesty, perseverance" jointly constitute the latest expression system of Zhejiang University's spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of education, continuously accumulate cultural height and strengthen the spirit, and has a rich connotation and profound significance.
Among them, "Hainan River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and tolerance, embodying the concept of "using talents from all over the world", and showing that the university should absorb the high-quality concept of the world's top schools in the education of people; "True honesty and great deed" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and perfection, which means that the university should not only pursue truth, but should also educate virtue and cultivate character; "Fundamentally reforming the country" emphasizes the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of new knowledge, the innovation of scientific research, and the manifestation of reform and development, the renewal of the old way of doing things.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
"Smart people listen to silence, and wise people see things before they appear."
China's colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, grasp the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction into a world-class university.
At the same time, we must uphold humanistic care and independence, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the national spirit mutually stir, so as to provide a continuous impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation and the common ideal of mankind.

At the speed of NFT, a new concept has emerged in the cryptocurrency community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs in the game began to earn stable income.
Axie Infinity is a pet cultivation game based on blockchain technology that combines NFTs and other modes. It is currently the highest-paid NFT project with a transaction value of more than $30 billion.
TokenTerminal data show that Axie Infinity's daily income exceeded US$820,000, making it the same as "Street Fighter."
On August 6, Axie Infinity said that its daily active users had exceeded 100,000.
The excitement of "Axie Infinity" will send a new "palytoearn" model to more people. Through the help of block chain and smart contracts, players will no longer be a single character. In addition to enjoying the game and receiving economic benefits, players can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game maker, but by the blockchain technology.
I have the biggest feeling when I see a news about a friend's stock price. The first thing to do is to choose the industry of the investment target, that is, to choose the industry of the investment target. At least 1 billion US dollars in market size. Secondly, choose the future growth-oriented industry, and choose the industry with the best growth potential after 3 to 5 years in the future. Finally, choose the industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the industry's development stage, and the flatness of the track refers to the industry's competition pattern.
Support the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the 2021 adjustment of the 2022 strategic layout.
The strategy is "do the things right", that is, do the things right.
The strategy is "do the right thing", which means doing the right thing.
The strategy is to find the direction, the tactics are to land, and there is space for strategic thinking above most tactics.
For example, how to increase customer numbers (tactical thinking) above, can think about the continuation of the current field or the extension of the field (strategic thinking); for example, how to increase customer retention rate (tactical thinking) above, can think about how to increase core customers and high-value customers's retention rate (strategic thinking); in order to increase activity participation (tactical thinking), can think about how to set the correct activity KPI, achieve the correct activity goal, such as increasing target customer participation, activating high-value silent customers, and precise brand-news; above, can think about whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
It has been 12 years since the birth of Bitcoin, and it has witnessed several landmark events in 2021.
On September 7, the Central American small country of El Salvador declared Bitcoin as a legal currency. This is the first time that Bitcoin has become a legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years, and it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the second time that a compliance Bitcoin futures ETF has entered the US capital market, and the widening of the cryptocurrency investment gap.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main character.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork called Taproot, which upgraded the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in the transaction through changing the data structure of the block.

U.S. Asian group complains about discrimination at 3 Ivy League schools - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (reporter Xu Qimei) A number of U.S. Asian groups submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting the discrimination of three Ivy League universities-Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College in the admissions process.
The Asian Education Alliance, which led the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The head of the group, Zhao Yuzhen, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants qualified for US top universities has grown by a factor of 10, but in the three US top universities, the proportion of Asian applicants has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" of enrollment, "long-term sustainability and systematic discrimination of Asian students".
Zhao Yuzhen said that the study of Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that in these three colleges and universities, the proportion of applicants relative to the number of applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
The data from the US Department of Education also showed that among all the Ivy League colleges, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest proportion of Asian student admissions, and Yale University and Brown University have effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian students for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yuzhen told reporters from Xinhua News Agency that they expect the US Department of Education and the US Department of Justice to investigate and take measures to prevent these universities from discriminating against Asian students after submitting a complaint.
They also expect the complaint universities to actively pay attention to this issue and change their admissions policies for Asian students.
At present, the three colleges and universities have not responded.
The Asian Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it complained about Harvard University's admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to the American Chinese group, the group also included American Indian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani educational groups.

On September 9, 2020, Mr.陸先生從房屋中介了解到位於浙江餘姚丈亭鎮的一個廠房,在多次現場看房後,Mr.陸先生決定購買該廠房。
On the same day, Mr. Lu negotiated with the family of Mr. Lin, who owned the land where the building was purchased, and transferred 20,000 yuan as a deposit.
Li signed as the payer on the receipts of the leasing contract, which states, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the earnest money will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the earnest money will be doubled back to the seller, and the two parties agreed to sign the leasing contract within a week."
However, after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on major contract terms such as the scope of the sale, payment methods, and so on, the housing purchase contract was not signed until late.
Considering that the parties failed to reach an agreement on the contract content, a few days later, Li returned 20,000 yuan of the deposit to Mr. Lu.
After all the hard work, he finally got the house he wanted, paid the down payment, and was ready to sign the contract. However, the seller did not sell the house. This made Mr. Lu frustrated and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuhua Municipal People's Court.
The court found that the two sides could not finally sign a formal contract, and it was not reasonable to attribute the failure to the defendant. Therefore, this case should not apply the fixed penalty rule, and the defendant did not need to bear the double repayment of the fixed penalty.
After the verdict, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original verdict.
The lawyer reminded that in the course of the transaction, it is necessary to comply with the necessary cautious attention obligation.
When signing the contract, as a buyer, you should take necessary cautious attention, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house has been occupied, etc., and clearly state the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes during the performance of the contract.
After the "Democracy Summit" in Germany was held on Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson issued a statement on Saturday (12th November) that the United States held a "leadership summit for the people" is "using ideology as a line to politicize and weaponize democracy, using the name of democracy to do the opposite of democracy, encouraging division and confrontation, and transferring domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and value ideology on others, carried out 'democratic reform', imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated a 'color revolution', causing devastating consequences.
Democracy has become a "massive weapons of mass destruction" for the United States.
This summit is Biden's action to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was video-conferenced and attended by the heads of state of 111 countries, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
Before the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for having problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States did not have the right to host such a summit.
And there are also critics in the international and domestic circles, such as those who criticize the invited leaders, including some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil. Some people doubt that the true intention of the Biden administration is not to organize this summit for democracy, but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly-elected German Prime Minister Scholz also attended the video democratic summit
The Chinese Foreign Ministry’s statement on Saturday said, “Today’s American democracy shows signs of insanity, money politics, identity politics, party opposition, polarization of politics, social strife, ethnic conflict, and income and wealth polarization.” The American democracy is based on capital.”
As the leader of the government, we have a duty to listen to our citizens, strengthen the bar of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability, and be more powerful to withstand the buffer and shock of authoritarianism and those who pursue power in the public interest before the public interest."
He stressed that democracy is not a foregone conclusion, "We must constantly update it in every generation, in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that "when the global democratic and human rights face a continuous and worrying challenge, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The United States has promised to carry out a one-year action after this democratic summit, including a 4.244 billion-dollar initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that all countries make specific public commitments before the 2022 physical democratic summit to improve their democratic system.
Biden said, "Let us all implement our commitments and report on our progress next year."
Okay, I only fear that he has sent the wrong address.

Education thoughts: How college entrance exams can make “scholars” and “scholars” equal - Xinhua
Three students from Lanzhou University of Technology sent a letter to the head of the school, expressing their confusion about university exams and proposing to increase the difficulty of exams, change the format of exams, and make exams truly reflect the actual level of students.
In fact, for a long time, university exams have been a "hot topic".
In the university campus, students come from all over the country, with different abilities and different learning degrees, and the learning situation is different.
For a group with such diverse characteristics, there are different feelings.
Of course, if the test questions are monotonous and the repetition rate is high, the questions are too simple, it will inevitably cause a completely different feeling.
Students who don't work hard may pass the examination in a concentrated way, but if they try other ways, they may achieve half the effect.
As a result, there is a "poor student" who can pass the examination without investing, and even get a high score; a "poor student" who never misses a class, and has good notes and notes, and has not increased the score in the examination.
It seems that the students of Langfang University of Science and Technology have no reason to believe that there are no problems in the university examination. They believe that this situation is not confined to Langfang University of Science and Technology.
From this perspective, I would like to praise these three students.
In fact, those who have gone to college know that those who prepare for the examination in a hurry and try various means to "borrow" the examination questions from the teachers are not uncommon, and the phenomenon of seeking "special guidance" before the examination is not rare, and even the situation in which the examination is mixed with little notes and after the examination asks for the teacher's favor is not unusual.
As a teaching quality evaluation-oriented, to measure a university's pass rate, more importantly, is the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning and scientific命题 on this basis.
When entering undergraduate studies, majors begin to be subdivided, and many majors courses are dominated by basic knowledge.
It is undeniable that whether you fully master the basic knowledge points of a discipline is the content of university examination.
The basic knowledge of undergraduate students is mainly the basic theory and basic knowledge of disciplines. From the point of view of knowledge, there is not much change, and basic is fixed.
As a teacher said, "20 years ago, I studied the basic knowledge of university mathematics, and now I still study it, but it is still the focus."
But the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test type is single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, the examination usually forms a composition group, and the composition of the examination is coordinated by senior teachers in the discipline, and the examination scoring is also coordinated by teachers in the discipline, so as to partially overcome the situation of the repetition of the examination.
However, it is necessary to prepare a set of test questions in line with the actual teaching and learning situation. The difficulty of the test is normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students. It is also necessary to comprehensively analyze the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the level of study of the students, so that the test命题 can have dynamic control over the difficulty and the type of questions. It can highlight the examination of the basic knowledge, and it can also pay attention to the examination of the ability. At the same time, it can also innovate the type of questions.
The examination is the driving force of university education. What kind of examination will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run?
For the student's letter, the蘭州交大校方 attaches great importance, and has deployed a plan to rectify the situation in the whole school.
It is required that all teaching units organize teachers to carry out seminars and course conclusion examination comparative self-examination, formulate examination test papers and related system, and strengthen supervision and inspection of examination test papers and review. It is also required to fine-tune the results assessment, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of course teaching in all aspects.
Solving the problems of the single type of questions and the repetition of the same questions from the aspect of mechanism is the topic that universities need to face. Of course, they need to set up corresponding regulations, but it is important to pay more attention to daily work. It is necessary for teachers to comprehend the teaching situation in a comprehensive way, not only to comprehend the teaching content, but also to comprehend the learning situation of students, both of which should be comprehended, so that teachers and students can better connect and form a benign interaction, so that the examination will be more in line with the reality, and so that "learners who are masters" and "learners who are masters" will have their own advantages.

Golden Woman Wedding Photography (South Street Store) is temporarily not a branch
Before taking photos, because we had not scheduled our time, we changed the time twice, and Mr. Lan Lan was patiently helping us arrange the time.
Later, he chose a good weekend to shoot.
The staff of the Queen Mother is excellent.
That was my first formal makeup, wow, I can't believe I will one day look so good, hahaha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) are super patient in makeup and makeup is also natural.
The photo was taken in the Jianghuang City. Fortunately, it was a nice day, so I didn't feel very cold, and when we took the photo, the make-up artist noticed our clothes, jewelry, and did some minor repairs.
The photographer is also very humorous, and he feels very happy every day when he takes photos.
When choosing photos, because I saw many cases on the Internet, I did not want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we choose photos, really, we did not want to add photos at all, just the 24 photos in the package (I heard that my sister, who was married at the same time as me, added more than 7,000 photos to the package, and I was shocked and afraid that I would choose too many photos at that time).
Today, the photo was edited, and Lan Lan sent me. I saw two photos that I didn't like, and they immediately helped me edit them.
Comparing the photo of my sister before, I think our photo is really satisfactory. Simple and fresh, that's what I want.
I sincerely recommend that you go to Wenchuan Jin Woman to take a wedding photo!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful for your sincere wishes for your happiness and prosperity. Your future looks bright!

(Yap, November 11) Sabah National Registration Board said that since special anti-counterfeiting paper stocks have run out, it has been impossible to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October. So far, the affected number has reached 3,200.
However, the head of the Bureau of Births and Deaths, Kailo Aminoa, assured that all the babies who have applied for birth certificates will have their information recorded in the system, and their birth certificates will be issued when the counterfeit paper arrives next week.
At a press conference, he explained the long period of reporting on the issue of printing newspapers in Sarawak for more than 10 months.
He said that the problems had appeared two months ago, and Sarawak also faced the same problems.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in the delay of their arrival in China. "
He explained that the use of counterfeit paper and other regions are different, so it cannot be loaned to other state-owned stocks.

48 hours of negative nucleic acid test and the "buffer zone" of the State Council to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (reporters董瑞丰、顾天成) The State Council Disaster Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the coronavirus epidemic in port cities, requiring people who leave land border port cities within 48 hours (excluding Hong Kong and Macau) to have a negative nucleic acid test result within 48 hours, and at least one nucleic acid test after people arrive in land border port cities.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the determination of the port cities of the provinces and municipalities and the announcement on March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that coastal cities with conditions can study the establishment of epidemic prevention buffer zones within the jurisdiction.
The relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission said that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the local main economic pillar, and the two sides of the border people have frequent exchanges.
Implement a differentiated management policy for areas, from a one-way prevention and control line to two lines, and hope to move the border forward, reduce the risk of contagion, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local cluster infections in China, all of which were imported from overseas.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as the monitoring and early warning of the epidemic in some places is not timely, the closed-loop management of high-risk positions is not implemented, the regular核酸 testing is a mere formality, the disinfection of various stages of the cold chain is not adequate, the management of the concentrated isolation places is not in line, and the scientific and precise handling of the epidemic response is not enough.
The notice requires that from the nine aspects of improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of the port city, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing the border control measures, and so on, to speed up the correction of the epidemic prevention and control short spots and weaknesses of the port city, and do a good job of epidemic prevention and control in an unremitting and scientific and precise way, and build a strong external prevention and control barrier.
The notice emphasizes that the cities at the ports should synchronously study and deploy the epidemic prevention and public security work, publish and open the public security hotline, regularly check the signs and symptoms of basic daily necessities supply and price, and solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems raised by the public.
According to the notice, the coastal cities mentioned include open land, sea and air ports in counties (prefectures, prefectures, prefectures, prefectures and prefectures), cities (prefectures, prefectures and prefectures), and prefectures and prefectures. The specific scope is determined by the provinces (prefectures, prefectures, prefecturas and prefectures) according to the need for epidemic prevention and timely notification.

The truth of the US military's 20 years of bloodshed - Xinhua
(Video source: YouTube)
On the 11th day of the month of November 2012, a micro documentary called "The Killing Machine" caused widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the U.S. invading Afghanistan with the pretext of "counterterrorism" and forcing the U.S.-style democracy through the war for 20 years. It committed various crimes against humanity.
Using drones to attack hospitals and schools, distorting human nature and forming a killing group.
For 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of Afghan innocent civilians.
The US military has set up a "black prison" to torture and humiliate the "guilty".
More Afghans hate the crimes against humanity.
As the video says, the U.S. "Counter Terrorism" war is "going against terrorism".
War has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan, but it has brought only devastation and slaughter.
Watch the video, let's uncover the truth about the United States' use of "anti-terrorism" as a pretext for bloodshed, and uncover the hypocrisy of American democracy!
I happened to see this article from a business perspective and from the perspective of preservation, why this customer wants to help the logistics company in the customs area to pack, although the packaging is a deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of the customs logistics company, here the text may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many baby food manufacturers and met many baby food production lines.
In fact, the raw materials for both bagged and sealed infant formula are the same.
So everyone will probably ask: Why is the bag's shelf life one year, and the can's shelf life is two or more years?
Or he asked again: What is the price difference between listening and bagging?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so that quality is better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the price is good.
Some consumers also said that the taste or smell of the food was different after eating it.
Now I would like to talk to you about the reason for the price, where is it?
Why is the difference so big?
Because when the manufacturers price, most of them consider that if the bag price is too high, consumers are difficult to accept, which means that the manufacturer's profit is low, or that there is no profit, what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a big increase in the price of the production to ensure their profit space.
Therefore, most manufacturers are pushing for hearing, not bagging.
And there are so many manufacturers who want to spend tens of millions or even billions of dollars on advertising every year. Where does this money come from?
Everyone can imagine it.
With the development of society, the cost of promotion, such as the cost of promotional personnel in shopping malls, the cost of display in shopping malls, the cost of gifts for products, and the cost of advertising, is also increasing.
Therefore, all the manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and they are listening to them, and the price of these products is also constantly increasing. Actually, this is the new product that comes out as the market costs increase.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, but their raw material costs will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their products, without any means, tied to the doctors in the hospitals, and they will help the promotion of the products, with a profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
However, China's relevant laws are absolutely not allowed to do such a thing. In fact, this is a practice that is harming consumers.
It is suggested that people buy bags of infant formula in advance, so as to save money, and increase the preservation and sealing ability of infant formula, which has no effect on children.
And everyone should not think that the quality of the hearing protection can last longer than that of the bagged. If the quality of the hearing protection is the same as that of the bagged after opening, it will be difficult to store and easy to deteriorate.

Don't let people get scared at the start line - Xinhua
When you go to the book fair, you often feel the popularity of books on success.
Today's successful books often promote the "optimal principle" - assuming or implying that you can "do it", and then telling you what you need to do is "what".
That is to say, it suddenly passes over the actually most important and fundamental part, "How to do it."
For this reason, these books have a common characteristic - either do your best, or don't do anything at all; either 100, or 0. Or you go to Mount Tai, or stay at home.
This "optimal principle" makes everyone who sees it admit that it is "correct", but 99% of the people will be shaken in the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make a decision to change your life and make a 180-degree change", which is exactly the weakness of many people.
For those who are unwilling to change, conform to tradition, and refuse to change, you have to shout at him "change," which is obviously a self-deception and a piece of musical chairs.
Most people will show hesitation before the word "change", stay at a standstill, and fail to make a decision; or they will make a decision based on a momentary impulse and take the first step, but often the good will not last for a long time, and they will be unable to continue for a long time.
Mr. Ma's famous "The Coming of Tomorrow" monologue is the best to convey this "classic of human nature".
The biggest problem with the "Strictest Principle" is that it is too high a hurdle, often exceeding the capabilities of ordinary people, making most people "weep".
Perhaps, the "principle of second best" is a way for more ordinary people to take a relatively successful path.
The core of the "principle of the best" is to "reduce the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "winning small victories", that is, if you can't do 100, you can only do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0. If you can't climb Mount Tai, you can only climb the little sand dunes at your door, because that is always better than stagnant.
In summary, as long as you do something, you are better than not doing anything.
Because the threshold has been lowered significantly, more people have the possibility to stick to it, and the success probability will also increase.
It is just a short way to follow the success path of the "less is more" principle.
Overall, the "optimal principle", although it pretends to be the best way to achieve success, can actually motivate only a small number of people; the "less good principle" can motivate more people and make as much benefit as possible.

青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量增加0.71万吨新华网
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporters骆晓飞、张宏祥) The reporter learned from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the青海省 that the latest monitoring results showed that the total amount of Nuoc-mam resources in Lake Qinghai has increased by 0.71 million tons, reaching 10.85 million tons, which is 40 times more than the initial protection in 2002.
The common name of the naked鲤 in Qinghai Lake is “Qinghai Fish”. It is a rare and valuable fish species in Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the “water-fish-bird” ecological chain in Qinghai Lake.
In the 1960s and 1970s, influenced by factors such as the large number of human hunting and the deterioration of the aquatic environment for the breeding of naked鲤, the number of naked鲤 in the Gansu Lake was drastically reduced. In 2002, the resource potential of the Gansu Lake naked鲤 was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake Naked鲤 was listed as a endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
From 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of the lake to fish, and has banned any unit, collective or individual from fishing the naked鲤 in the main rivers and tributaries of the Qinghai Lake, and from selling the naked鲤 and its products.
At the same time, by continuously increasing the protection measures such as artificial spawning and release, as well as by cleaning the main rivers entering the Gobi Desert and designing a scientific and reasonable "overfishing channel", the amount of Gobi Desert naked鲤 resources has increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, Qinghai Lake naked鲤鱼累计人工增殖放流近128 million fish, and the contribution rate of Qinghai Lake naked鲤鱼资源恢复 exceeded 23%.
The三江源地区 is an important ecological barrier and water source in China and even Asia. The Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the westward spread of desertification.
In order to protect三江源地区和青海湖水域 ecological environment and protect aquatic wild animals, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Tibetan Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has issued the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake, and has built a comprehensive fishing management system of "one river, one lake".
I used #PRS_ORG# Red credit card to order more than $180.

I just saw an article about a period.
For men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period at the age of 13-15, and stop menstruating at the age of 50.
After being healthy, it will come once a month.
But it is not a regular pattern that can be accurately predicted. About a week of publicity, it needs to be prepared in advance, sometimes luck is bad and it will also fail (suddenly it is better a few days in advance).
The length of time, blood loss, and menstrual cramps vary from person to person. Some people have menstrual cramps for three days, others for a week; some people have little blood loss, while others have blood loss. Some people have no reaction, while others have severe pain; the menstrual cramps will change with time. No pain means no pain forever.
Moon menstruation cannot be controlled, and a few days of 24-hour bleeding can only be stopped by sucking on a tampon or a sanitary napkin to prevent the bleeding to clothes and chairs.
The main cause of menstrual cramps is the release of prostaglandins. Before the beginning of the menstrual cycle, you can take ibuprofen to effectively alleviate the pain. After the beginning of the menstrual cycle, taking nothing will not help.
Because of the increased blood flow in the uterus and the excessive release of prostanoids, it is easy to have diarrhea during the period.
If you suddenly have diarrhea, you will have a period within two days.
It is better to change the sanitary pads every two or three hours. Otherwise, it is easy to breed bacteria. In addition to the sleep time, the worst situation is to change the sanitary pads every six hours, every seven days, that is, 42 pieces, if you add the pre-prepared pieces, there may be 50 pieces, not one piece every month.
(Here, the modification is that the sanitary napkin is not often changed, about 5 to 6 hours, and the longest is 8 hours)
The hormones in the menstrual period may be more impulsive, and the ovulation period may also be unstable because of the changes in the internal hormones. It is very unfortunate, and the body makes trouble for itself.
However, official crime rate data show that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional problems as excuses.
Not only is the blood flowing, but also the detached uterine mucosa.
After the menstrual period, the uterine endometrium is the thinnest, and then gradually thickens, which can be understood as that the uterus is a house, and that the house is built every month (the endometrium thickens), ready to welcome guests. When the guests do not come, it is all demolished (the menstrual period ends), and the new house is built next month.
The menstrual period is inconvenient. For decades, it is 24 hours of bleeding every month, and it will cause abdominal pain and lower back pain. Who wants it?
However, a human being can be born because his mother has had her period. A period is prepared for you to live in a house for 10 months when you come into the world. Everyone should thank their mother for regular and healthy period.
Previously, many things for women were suppressed, and the society said that it was dirty, shameful, and everyone thought that was how it was. But times have changed.
If someone feels that her period is disgusting, that the preparation of her body for the birth of life is disgusting, she should not say it in front of a large audience, and the girls stood up, and stop thinking about it, never having experienced it, never having understood it, and never having experienced it, and never having understood it, and never having experienced it, never having understood it, never having experienced it, never having experienced it, never having understood it.
Finally, sister try to use tampons, it really works.
Today is the winter solstice, and the mistake is disappointing.
To order another meal for the children
It is hoped that the shop should check the quality at any time.
Does the foot bath cause a tingling sensation?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in foot massage and health care. Today, the author of the store will answer this question, and hope that it will help friends.
With people's health awareness increasing, foot baths are becoming more and more popular among consumers. There are a number of products in the market from less than RMB 100 to more than RMB 1,000, which gives consumers a lot of choice.
On the surface of relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, sales of health care appliances such as foot baths are hot, but foot baths do not have a special industry standard, so there is a certain safety hazard.
It is really dangerous to take a bath in a water with electricity!"
Mr. Li told the reporter that he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday present, but when his father washed his feet, his feet felt numb.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath, but when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt a sense of numbness on his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen and it lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually charged.
After that, he contacted the merchants, and the merchants' attitude was not good. Although he had withdrawn the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because there is no clear and detailed industry regulation on the setting of the highest temperature, which is suitable for which group of people and which materials are safe, the foot bath has been popular for a long time.
However, in general, a foot bath will not have any electrical problems, but it is not excluded that some products were not strictly controlled at the time of manufacture.
Therefore, when buying, choose a portable foot bath.
Water and electricity are separated without any safety risks.
At the same time, you can take an electric pen to measure.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opened - View Topics - Hunan Daily Net - Xinhua Online
Hunan Daily News, 12 October (Full media reporter Zhang Shengwu, Hu Weijian, photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Nongli Red Tea Promotion Meeting was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showing the tea industry, innovative tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of tens of billions of tea industry.
Jiang Shui, deputy director of the Council of the National Council of China for Supply and Demand Co-operation and deputy director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a grand introduction at the opening ceremony: The source of the red lake is in Neijiang, and the rise of red tea has injected new impetus into the "colorful Hunan tea."
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of the ten billion yuan Hunan tea industry, forming the development pattern of "three Hunan, four water, five color tea."
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and green tea, black tea, and red tea have stepped up their efforts. The main producing areas have promoted the integration of tea travel, and have led the tea farmers to increase their income.
The Feng Shui is changing, and red tea is getting stronger.
The tea experts in the province said that after harvesting green tea, they will harvest red tea and black tea. The tea farmers will have income all year round. The tea farm output will rise sharply.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of companies the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Newar City was honored with the "Honghu Origin".
At the Xi'an Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants snapped up a high mountain tea called "Ice Spring". They immediately ordered it.
Wang Jian, Secretary General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said that factors such as the current pandemic and so on affect the tea market to a certain extent, but from the perspective of the tea expo, there are a lot of highlights.
The red tea of Xing'anling has a bright red color, which has infused the tea culture connotation, and the Hunan tea industry welcomes the new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can you cancel?
I don't want it, because there is no place to park, so he couldn't bring it
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through sensing.
Formalism is the basic principle of philosophy and aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.

It studies what kind of ethical behavior the people should follow, application ethics (applying ethical theories to actual life situations, including biological ethics, political ethics, etc.), description ethics (collecting information on how people live, from observed styles to summarize.
It does not examine ethics from a theoretical perspective, but from the real choices made by actual moral subjects (moral agents) and observed, and all the ethical factors that prompted those choices, it studies the social group's ethical outlook.

丁子霖: To my friends.
I sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian aid during the 30 years after my family's death, especially since I made an appeal for humanitarian aid in my personal name to friends all over the world at the beginning of 1994.
Nowadays, most of the victims’ old parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up to work.
Your selfless acts helped us to pass through the most difficult time.
At present, the coronavirus epidemic is raging around the world. Most of the donors have retired.
Therefore, I implore you to stop donating to the Mother Group of Tian'anmen Square, a humanitarian aid project that should have a perfect conclusion.
I will always remember your kindness and believe that your acts will be remembered in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me!
Accept my sincere blessings.
陶业按：Allow me to introduce the history of the United States Institute for Chinese Studies (IFCSS) and the Chinese Democracy Foundation of Minnesota (MCDF) for 32 years of humanitarian aid.
In the course of humanitarian assistance, the United States and the Chinese Democratic Foundation of Minnesota are parallel organizations. Executors often cross.

Relief funds are often not delivered to the families of the missing people promptly.
In 1994, under the advice of Ding teacher, a special group was set up for the reception and distribution of humanitarian aid, under the name of the Tiananmen Mother.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "Fund for the Education of the Sixty-Five Pupils," which was implemented for 11 years. In 2009, after graduating from college, the MCDF set up the "Fund for the Support of the Elderly and Vulnerable Persons of the Sixty-Five Pupils," and has been implemented to date.
The funds for these projects are mainly from donations from the campus and society in the spring of 1966, from individual donations, and supported by the Brother University Democratic Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Prison Reform Research Foundation.
It has been 31 years since the victims of Tiananmen Square were finally given some donations from Hong Kong in the name of Tiananmen Square.
During this period, the "Human Rights in China" also independently carried out its humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding called for a halt to the donation to the Tiananmen Massacre was in consideration of the donors. We are also some retired people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement, so I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Ding for his “Letter to Friends”.
We will respect their decision and terminate the project within two years and resume it in the event of need.
Thank you and respect to all the colleagues who have always been generous and risked their lives to send humanitarian aid.

[Effect] photo effect: took two clothes. Overall, it is not bad. I like the picture set.
Service details: Because I was a little uncomfortable when I was making my makeup, the makeup artist and the staff were very kind to let me rest for a while and always gave me hot water to drink.
Package price: 1000 yuan
Thank you for the review. I originally said that the traditional style is not suitable for the traditional style. I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for the recognition, your satisfaction can make us full of energy to continue forward, and we will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really amazing. I strongly recommend all of you to come!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography, and post-production, it is unbeatable.
The make-up artist is very subtle, and they can match your style with makeup that suits you. They also use big-name makeup.
For example, the teacher of Tai Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio is very artistic, with two little cats playing with each other.
We are in Beijing, and the best photo studios in Beijing need to queue up 6 months in advance. Some of my colleagues have been shooting in Beijing, and I have watched the completed film and found it just so so.
I have been looking for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, and we think this is the short version of most people. Photographer Li Gong will capture the natural and beautiful moments.
Make-up artist, photographer, post-production, a fine team.
We and everyone around us were delighted.
She has already recommended her best friend to go, and her best friend is also full of joy.
We hope that such a studio will not be buried, and more people will find it and make it their own style, rather than being uniform.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews by Zhigang and Xinli, both of whom are very innovative and creative newcomers. We are the creative studio, and we will do our best to complete the job even if the customer doesn't like it. Thank you for meeting.
The sweet and kind assistant, and lively photographer teacher, everyone in the team is super nice and wonderful. A great experience, a difficult one, and the result is much better than I expected. Thanks for all the hard work. 😘😘
Thank you for your comment. Connected with you is a kind of chance. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, our trust in you is the same as the distance of thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to meet you. Next time, I will come to Qinhuangdao to play.

One who wants to share his personal experience.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it is better to learn from home, because the cost of training is very high, and it takes 6 months to learn.
However, if you are planning to enter this industry, training is a very good choice, especially for those who are weak in self-control and so on.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, it is necessary to check the strength of the teaching staff of the training institution. If the teaching staff are not strong enough, the training institution will not have much meaning. Of course, some new training institutions have not strong teaching staff.
Secondly, before choosing, you should inquire about the training institution, and best of all, you should inquire about the students from the institution, because only the students from the institution know what the course is about.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer this question, because I don't have a certain introduction to your situation, and this thing is closely related to your situation.
For example, your specialty, your age, your interest in learning a language, and even where you want to study or want to work, will be related to you.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or if you have graduated from a computer science program, I would personally suggest self-taught if there is enough time. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Now, many online and offline training institutions are also quite good, but learning costs are high, and it takes a lot of time to invest. It is basically required to focus training for 3 to 6 months.
However, if I said these things, it would be easy for me to learn, and now many online learning resources are free, or you can go to b站 for many training resources. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but you can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, then you can go to the training institution to learn, so that you don't have to learn very hard, the teacher explains it in detail, and there are people who can answer your questions. In addition, it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
In addition, many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internship places, and recommend them to the company after learning, so the interview process for finding a job can also save a lot of things.
These are some of my thoughts, for I don't know your situation well, so I only give a brief introduction and is not detailed. If you have other questions, you can contact me for communication.
I said I would come before 1, and I saw it on the App
What is it?
I haven't said everything yet. What are you doing?
I am responsible for installing, cleaning, repairing, wall-mounted hot water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, gas ovens, stove tops, window cleaners, glass cleaning, and home services.
Thank you for those who gave me a thumbs up, for life to work hard. Life is hard, but we must continue.
Life will not let anyone down, and if you like it, follow me, and thank those who have taken the time to comment
Life is like this. People only look at the results, while we support ourselves through the process of facing life. In the face of life, besides being strong, we have to continue, and there is no choice but to continue. The road can be turned back, but we cannot turn back.
Cleaning is a job, also a responsibility, and life is beautiful because of service, and service is beautiful because of care.
Although cleaning is the most dirty job we do, we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the client's house and see the satisfied smile and raised thumb of the client. At that moment, all the hard work is worth it. Paying will eventually have its reward!
My daily work
Your request, my service.
With care, with care, with care, with care, with care.
The details you care about, Feng Jiajiao will help you do "clean" what I can, and serve your family.
Bao Wan's family is clean, the tree family is clean, the service is perfect, and the clean is at home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal light is beautiful, it will become dull and dim if it is not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can the light shine. So is life.
It is necessary to do it with care, and we are serious about making it perfect.
Give me the opportunity, and I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality means everything. Because a professional deserves to be trusted, your trust is what I encourage most!
All industries are bad now.
But I always believe that with a serious attitude, enough perseverance, and enough efforts, I will be better than others at least, at least better than sitting and complaining!
Every day begins in the morning. All good things begin in the morning. May you carry happiness, luck, health, and success to start a new day and keep a good mood throughout the day. Good morning
When I was a child, happiness was something; when I grew up, happiness was a goal; when I became mature, I discovered that happiness was a mental attitude; when I understood, I felt happy.
Be the most authentic and kindest self you can be, follow your heart, and be content with your life for this one lifetime. There is only one way to live your life, and that way is to follow your heart. There are two things you can have in life: good health and good mood. So live a beautiful life to the end!
Every stage of life will encounter different problems.
Many times, what holds you back is not your ability, but your courage to face it.
Since we can't avoid it, let's face it.
You are more afraid, and you will be defeated by difficulties. If you face difficulties, the problem will be solved.
China-Saudi策展人携手举办沙特阿拉伯首届当代艺术双年展新华网
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (reporter Wang Huiyao Hu Chuan) - Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art double-year exhibition - Dali Contemporary Art Double-Year Exhibition, officially opened to the public in Dali JAX art area in the west of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participating.
The two-year exhibition is jointly organized by the Saudi-Dariya Foundation for the Dual Year Exhibition and the Chinese UCCA Yunnan Contemporary Art Center, and the Chinese UCCA Yunnan Contemporary Art Center's director, Xu Tianyu, serves as artistic director.
According to the organizing team, the theme of this two-year exhibition is "crossing the river with stones", metaphorizing the reform strategies adopted during the economic transformation era, and reflecting the current situation of Saudi society and culture.
The two-year exhibition, which occupies nearly 12,000 square meters, spans six connected buildings and is presented in six units: "Feeling stones", "Experiment of inheritance", "Thinking at the edge", "Going to the public", "Wonderful New World" and "Art's spirit".
Among them, 27 Saudi artists' works account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including painting, installation art and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works are also popular, some artists using recycled materials creatively, such as Xu Ping in the series of "The Story behind the Mountain" (2014), reimagining a classic山水画.
Barclay, chief executive of the Dierie Two-Year Exhibition Foundation, said that he hopes that this two-year exhibition will establish international dialogue, so that the global audience can learn about the flourishing cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interactive exchanges.
田霏宇说：“双年展的目标是双重的，既能让沙特阿拉伯当代艺术参与全球对话，也能让沙特阿拉伯观众融入当代艺术世界。 ”
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the double year. Artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss cross-cultural exchanges, contemporary art development and other themes.

Yunnan: Coordinating and standardizing the management of public service positions in rural areas - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (reporter Lin Bingfeng) In order to continue to do a good job of employment support for the poor, and to consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty eradication, Yunnan Province has recently issued relevant policies to promote the management of public service positions in rural areas to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, at present, Yunnan has developed 4.83 million village public service jobs, which are used to provide employment for rural disadvantaged groups such as the poor, and has played an important role in helping the poor to achieve employment income increase, consolidating the poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively enhancing the rural public service capabilities.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments such as Yunnan Human Resources and Rural Renewal, including Yunnan Provincial People's Employment and Social Security Bureau, Yunnan Provincial People's Employment and Social Security Bureau, Rural Renewal Bureau, Finance Bureau, and Yunnan Provincial People's Employment and Social Security Bureau.
In the field of job development, the new regulations clearly state that according to the principle of "need-based placement, on-the-job management, dynamic control and total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person, one job, open to the public, unified management", the placement should be made.
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of advertisement, declaration, review, publicity, appointment, on-the-job training and appointment.
In addition, the new regulations also define the specific responsibilities of the development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and the subsidy methods of rural public welfare posts, and stipulate that the development departments of rural public welfare posts should purchase accidental injury business insurance for people who are employed in rural public welfare posts. It requires the relevant departments to regularly monitor the payment of rural public welfare posts.

Hello
Can you cancel the order?

Second, although the right side has a prosperous era in history, it is short, so it is short because it gives a little sunshine and drinks a little hot water; if it is prosperous, it will get greedy, and if it is hit, it will fall flat.
But in reality, the right side played a positive role in social progress.
From ending the definition of truth standards, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting political institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right should not be negated.
Three. For me, although I do not fully agree with Li Weidong's some statements, I care about his statements and respect Li Weidong; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is serious about social problems in China.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, and I believe that anti-revolutionary revolution inevitably leads to social turmoil, harm to people's livelihood, and the political groups are mixed.
Four. Change or improve China must have patience and a sense of responsibility for the country and the people. Politicians who try to make money on politics are not rightwingers, but idiots.
Let's talk again.
Left, in fact, is a bunch of time and political orphans.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will also listen to some right and analyze their thoughts in need, but the left will not have this opportunity because the left wants what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Five. I recently saw some friends argue with the traitors while refuting the lunatics, and it was quite inspiring. I don't think it is necessary.
Do not try to have a talk with traitors and leftists, both of whom are stubborn.
And don't try to prove that we are right, and don't think that the fools and the left are going to admit, why?
I tell my friends this: When the traitor insults you five yuan, when the left idiot insults you right dog, it proves that our middle road is right!
Many people have ideals in their youth, but as they grow older, they forget their ideals, or pursue ideals, but become fanatical.
And the pursuit of ideals is getting farther and farther away, and even the young master of martial arts is becoming a dragon.
I think that right and left refers to restraint and freedom. China should be to the left from the historical and cultural innate genes.
In contrast, the domestic right-wing liberalism emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left emphasizes supervision and focuses more on fairness and security.
Nowadays, the general public hopes for a more equal society, but China and the United States are at war, and the left is definitely true. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, I can just like it
Nothing to say, flowers are so kind.
In the past two years, the blockade and confinement of the US against Huawei chips have not only brought Huawei into unprecedented trouble, but also caused the "US" companies to suffer huge losses.
The United States has imposed a blockade on China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and related enterprises in its allies to be blocked at the same time, which directly results in the impact of global chip suppliers' orders and profits on China's chip industry, causing the research and development investment of chip production enterprises to decrease and production capacity to decrease, thereby causing a global shortage of chip supply chains.
Nowadays, "missing chips" has affected all major industries, such as the suspension of car production and the rise in the price of mobile phones, and all industries that use chips have been adversely affected.
In order to control the "chip" autonomy, more and more powerful technology giants are beginning to move towards the path of "going out of the United States".
In order to牢牢掌握全球半导体控制权，遏制中国半导体行业的发展，老美最近动作频频，又主持“芯片峰会”；又邀请64个国家巨头成立半导体联盟，并拨款扶持美国本土科技巨头，比如，美国老牌科技巨头英特尔为了夺回芯片领域的主导地位，斥资20亿美元在美国亚利桑那州建两座晶圆加工厂，对外开放芯片代工业务。
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC and may possibly take away TSMC's "job".
This is because Intel, as a major US technology giant in the semiconductor industry, has worked in the semiconductor industry for decades and has a large number of talent and technical reserves. It is certain to rise quickly and defeat TSMC in the short term.
However, for the decision by Intel, the founder of TSMC, Zhang Zhongji, is indifferent.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongxian spoke out in a shocking manner, saying that Intel's investment in building a chip factory was quite ironic.
Zhang Zhongxian disliked Intel's entry into the wafer industry because Zhang Zhongxian still remembers the enmity between Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Intel 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was always a jewel in the United States' manufacturing industry. It was the leader of the world semiconductor industry.
In the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were controlled by a few powerful players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip was completed by one factory from design to packaging. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model has made some small enterprises unbearable, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs have to put up with huge production line construction costs.
Under the influence of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show the phenomenon of division and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongji heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, so he believed that since there are companies specializing in design, it can be established a special factory for chip manufacturing.
Shortly thereafter, Zhang Zhongji's idea turned into reality, and TSMC emerged.
Taiwan Semiconductor intends to focus on the “chip processing” single step, without design, and provide chip manufacturing services.
At that time, the newly established Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was just a junior in front of Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongji had sought investment from Intel, but at that time, Intel heard that TSMC was only engaged in the manufacturing sector of the chip industry, it was obviously arrogant, and it refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongji also believed that Intel was insulted at that time.
What I didn't expect was that the big players in the semiconductor manufacturing service industry were now going to start to do the semiconductor manufacturing.
So, Zhang Zhongji felt that Intel's entry into the wafer manufacturing was ironic.
Now, Taiwan Semiconductor's market value has exceeded Intel.
In the face of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's powerful attack, Intel is also not able to remain indifferent.
Nowadays, TSMC is pushing towards the 3nm chip, while Intel is still stuck at the 14nm of 7 years ago.
To catch up is not easy.
Not enough
The order has been placed for 2 hours.
Today, some strange hot topics.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly choose three hot topics: February 2's rise of the Dragon, Luo Lijia's rise, and the case of goodsallie, and the spread of public opinion forms a peak, and then the smooth curve (smoothing curve) finally dissipates, and if secondary public opinion occurs, there will be a small驼峰.
They look similar to the model shown on the Internet Information Office's official website.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot topics from the same event, and present a "monolith", "steep slope", and "divided cliff".
The "monolith" refers to human heating, which quickly climbs the hotlist and attracts the attention of the public; the "steel blade" refers to periodic heating, which ensures the topic occupies the hotlist; and the "divide and conquer" refers to collective evacuation, which ensures that the hotlist plays its "function" and goes to the new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of a hot event coincides with the trough of another event, and the time difference is not more than a few seconds. It is certain that a unified batch of watermen received the task and launched a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot topics are on the list at the same time, which attract people's attention, which are responsible for publicity, which are conducive to war, which move people's eyes, which affect cognition, which mislead judgments, which provoke emotions, which entice decisions, which are refined in stages and nodes, almost considering all elements in the dissemination of public opinion.
Publicity is a science, ignoring all subjective factors, just from the objective data, black publicity will also disappear.
We will excavate such traces together.

Mauritius and other countries have discovered the first cases of infection with the Omiyakun virus - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12. According to the reports of foreign reporters of Xinhua News Agency, Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have reported the first cases of infection with the variant of the coronavirus known as Oxford-AstraZeneca.
Mauritius reported for the first time two cases of infection with the Omisken strain on October 10.
According to Cailash Jahangirpal, the Minister of Health, one of the infected persons was a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27; the other infected person was a local resident of Mauritius who had contact with a person who had recently visited South Africa and returned to Mauritius on November 30.
After being isolated at the hospital, the two infected persons' nucleic acid test results turned out to be negative. They have now returned to their respective residences.
The Cyprus Health Ministry announced on October 10 that it had confirmed the first three cases of infection with the Ominiko virus.
These three are students. They came back from abroad earlier this month. They were not admitted to hospital because they are all mild cases.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omink戎毒株, the Sez government has continuously increased its prevention efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, all 12-year-old passengers entering the country by plane will have to pay a fee to undergo a nucleic acid test at the airport.
On October 10, the Ministry of Health also announced that it would begin to immunize children aged 5 to 11 in the country with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
Malawi's Health Minister, Qembu Chibuda, said on September 9 that the country had discovered the first three cases of infection with the Ominiki strain.
The country's health department sequenced the genomes of 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and discovered the three infected cases.

Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#
Do you need to stay in the conversation?
I called and explained to your staff
Your rider told me the address is too far

At first, it was recommended by friends because of trust, so I chose to see. At first, my budget was 7,000 yuan for basic construction.
He began a series of deceits at the store.
I came to the store for the first time, just to show them my floor plan, and they did not measure the house on the ground. They quoted me that my 135 house with a price of 7,000 yuan is achievable. I looked at their materials and did not know what kind of materials they are.
Their second trick is that once you go to the store, you will be dragged to hand over the deposit (and once you hand over the deposit, you will never be able to withdraw it, unless you have enough experience to fight with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay a deposit, they would invite the so-called manager to tell me that you can get a certain discount if you pay the deposit on today.
This is a big hole, and I am the example of a person who was deceived, when my mind was impulsive, I had paid more than 1,000 yuan in advance.
He gave me a lot of questions, including 7,000 including water and electricity renovation, including any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, and these are the main costs.
In addition, their service fees are higher than those of other companies.
I lost faith in this company, and I did not have time to clarify everything before signing the contract.
When I went to find them to return the money, they showed a lot of experience, with a special team to deal with you.
Anyhow, it is the problem of the customer. They have no responsibility.
All kinds of excuses, many details, I don't want to say one by one are tears, in summary, don't choose them, because my friend's house is also quality bad, and I will calculate various costs for you in the future.
Terrible, they are the original head decoration that used to deceive people, now they have become beautiful, and seem to have closed again.
So don't choose such a shameless company.
In the future, when choosing, you can look up these consulting, because the renovation is not small money.

Please cancel the order within 30 minutes!
Isn't there another way? For example, change your address?
Okay, then don't cancel the conversation. If you don't refund me within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely investigate.
I asked whether it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes.

The sky is full of stars, and there will be a great eclipse of the Pleiades on the 14th - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (reporter Zhou Ruikang) According to the天文科普专家, as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the twin stars in the North Hemisphere's third major meteor shower, the Pleiades meteor shower, will come to a climax on December 14, and lovers of meteor showers can observe it in the night of the next day.
Beijing天文爱好者安久在青海拍摄的双子座流星雨。
Most of the meteor showers are icy comets, but the mother body of the Pleiades meteor shower is the 3,200-year-old asteroid Faeghan, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The double zodiac meteor shower is also the second one not caused by comets.
The member of the天津市天文学会、天文科普专家修立鹏介绍说， like a Christmas movie, the double-polar star shower usually appears at the end of the year, and the "filming schedule" can be extended from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is famous for its large flow and steady, and is called the third big meteor shower of the Northern Hemisphere with the Perseid meteor shower and the Pleiades meteor shower.
One notable feature of the Sagittarius constellation is that the speed of the meteorite is slow, the color is rich, and there are a lot of firecrackers. It is suitable for beginners in the field of astronomy photography.
Yu Jing, a photographer of Tianjin天文爱好者, photographed the double zodiac meteor shower in Qingdao, Tianjin, on December 13, 2020.
According to the astronomical forecast, the double zodiac meteor shower will come to a maximum on the 14th of December at about 15:00. At the maximum, the ZHR (in the ideal observation condition, the radiation point is above the head) is 150.
The recommended index map of the double zodiac meteor shower.
Last year, the "beautiful fallen" double zodiac meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's double zodiac meteor shower will be affected by the moonlight, and the brilliance will be a little reduced.
On November 14, the lunar phase is a waning crescent moon, and the bright moon will cause interference to the observation. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the latter half of the night. At this time, the radiation point of the Sagittarius constellation will also rise higher.
Friends who like watching meteor showers can observe them in the afternoons after the moon sets, but be careful to stay warm. "
How can we observe more meteors as much as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with a high altitude, a small amount of light pollution, and a wide view of the east, and then wait patiently until the moon sets.
It is necessary to note that the flow of the Sagittarius A* Sagittarius A* star cluster is very large, so it is not necessary to always look at the Sagittarius A* star cluster's radiation point in order to observe the Sagittarius A* star cluster.
If you like photography, you should choose a wide-angle lens with a large aperture and use high ISO and the maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and sustainability, a tripod, a spare battery and a shutter line are also indispensable. "
He reminded that.
What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in the market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the subject means the LCD TV, while the difference between the market positioning of laser TV and LCD TV mainly lies in the following two points:
First, laser television focuses on the large screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of the LCD television, the laser television obviously focuses on the large-screen market, that is, the laser television itself is a product for the large-screen market.
At present, the mainstream LCD television sizes are in the range of 55 inches to 65 inches, while the laser TV sizes are generally in the range of 75 inches to 100 inches, fully meeting the user's demand for large-screen televisions.
In recent years, the proportion of the laser television's global sales and sales in the overall television sales has been increasing. It accounts for more than 60% of the overall television sales of 80 inches and above.
According to CIIHK's prediction, in 2020, the sales of laser televisions will increase by more than 140%, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The good performance in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of the laser television, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eye. Compared with the backlight source of the liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of the object in natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is smaller.
China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute Sesi Laboratory and Beijing協和醫院眼科專家, through the strict comparison test of laser television and liquid crystal television, obtained 144 sets of test data.
The data confirmed: Laser TV has a strong eye-catching property, and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
At a time when the importance of vision health is increasing, laser televisions not only attract more and more users, but also open up another breakthrough point in the television market.
Second, laser television focuses on the high-end market.
In contrast to the downward trend in the price of LCD televisions, the current market price of laser televisions is generally more than 10,000 yuan. With the upgrade of size and light source, the price gradually increases.
Why is the laser TV so expensive?
It is certainly right.
Under the continuous development of light source and technology level, laser television has many advantages that cannot be realized by LCD and projection television.
With the short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of the laser television is shorter than that of the traditional projection equipment. It can achieve the 100-inch large-screen experience in a short distance. The space requirement is small, and the mainboard is small, occupying little space.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser televisions can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
In addition, it has a lower calorific value and a small loss of equipment. The lifetime of the television is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser television models also include many cutting-edge technologies such as 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, and biological screen, which can bring the users a more shocking picture and sound experience.
It is not about fake demand, but the product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and investment and output ratio, Laser TV is not a dish for video players. If you want to balance the big screen and the insufficient viewing environment, you can try. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. After weighing the pros and cons, you can judge it on your own. It is too dangerous to listen to one-sided words.
To put it simply, the wide-angle near-focus projection machine, laser television, has to use the expensive wide-angle lens and reflector to get close to the screen, which is not in line with the optical optimal design.
In order to block part of the environmental light, using a micro-structure Fresnel screen, the cost is high, and the price of 80 inches is basically the same as that of 65 inches.
And one more thing, I especially dislike the projection manufacturers who use the phrase "good for eyes" as a selling point. Please, eyes can see the light on the screen of the projection is direct light, and the light on the ceiling is not visible to the eyes, so the LCD television is also "good for eyes", and the ceiling of the television is not also illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not reflective, it cannot be like.
The hot spot effect of the high gain screen was overlooked, and a large number of light rays were reflected back to the eyes at a certain angle, which was really uncomfortable.
The photo and visual aesthetic photography museum selects the quality store temporarily has no branches
When I added a WhatsApp appointment date, the sister arranged the available time for me and responded promptly.
Before going, I looked at the store's photography works, more outdoor wedding photos, which were very beautiful and involved a lot of photography styles.
When I arrived, I talked to my sister and explained my thoughts to her. She was very patient and helped me try two styles of clothes that I was indecisive. Finally, I decided to start makeup and hair styling. The photographer would set up some props before shooting, guide the action, and pay close attention to every detail.
However, it may be because I haven't communicated with me about the specific shooting ideas, so the style that I want is not what I got, but it should be beautiful🙊🙊
After the photo is taken, the photographer will help choose photos, exchange the style of post-production, and feel quite careful.
The repairing film will take about half a month. Wait for the effect~
Second chance to win a photo shoot! Most of the clothes can choose one.
Finally, she chose a black chiffon skirt to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about two hours. The photographer is the brother of the 95-year-olds. I feel a little awkward at first, but I hope to give more suggestions on how to shoot the customer's action instructions in the future. He is very talkative and the shooting process is quite enjoyable.

Go to the top of the page and see Queenie.
First, I filled in my name and phone number, then I chose the clothes, and the wedding dress can be chosen. I changed three or four clothes for a long time. After choosing the clothes, I spent a lot of time in makeup. The service attitude is also good. After shooting, I will teach you how to make up your looks. But the feeling on your face is big, and the post-production says it will be sent to you in half a month or three or four days. It seems like there is no difference from the original film.
The environment is generally good.
There are many options for clothing.
There are three makeup locations in the studio.
The service is very warm and very careful.
The hairstylist was patient.
The photographer will also be very serious about teaching you the movements.
If you are dissatisfied, the photographer will also ask for a redo.
The experience may have been a little out of place. The original eyelid was three eyelashes.
Her eyebrows were also shaved, which made her a little embarrassed when she didn't draw her eyebrows.
The photo was taken ten days ago, but the P-touch effect was not very satisfactory. I felt that the double eyeliner was still obvious.
Because I don't know what kind of style I want, I tried two styles. Finally, I chose black dress. The little sister said that this is a kind of retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to make my make-up and hair. The hairdresser and make-up artist sister were very patient in helping me. The make-up made me very satisfied.
After getting my make-up and hair done, I started taking pictures. The photographer directed me to pose throughout the whole process. It was very easy and harmonious.
After shooting, I carefully selected four of my favorite photos for retouching. The little brother said that I could make a film within 15 minutes. I was very satisfied at the end.
I've been without a response for three days... because your system can't identify my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card for every payment
I have to pay the fare every time
Can I be exempted from paying my monthly fee?
Does a small umbrella buy insurance?
The small umbrella is an internet insurance broker platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the Guiding Opinions on the Supervision and Regulation of Insurance Brokers (2015 Edition), to become an insurance broker, one must meet the following three keywords: shareholders, the last three years of no major violations of laws, the minimum limit is RMB 5 million, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are actually very strict, summarizing that they must have strength, must be approved by the National Bureau of Insurance Regulatory and Supervision (which regulates insurance companies and banks nationwide) and that shareholders must have a good reputation. As a small umbrella insurance, the insurance provided by the insurance broker company is not required to question whether the small umbrella insurance is legitimate or not, since there are three thresholds, and not all insurance companies can reach them.
On this point, it is not bad, and it is trustworthy.
From the insurance product point of view: Small umbrella insurance is a insurance supermarket. Many companies' star life insurance policies are sold on this platform. For example, the latest and Tai Super Mario 5 life insurance policy, the insurer and the insurer are the same as Tai Life Insurance, and small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so it does not need to question its reliability.
From the point of view of payment mode: The products of the Internet platform are generally more competitive than those of the traditional channels because they have less operating costs and the cost of business agents' salaries, so the products of the Internet platform are generally more competitive. The payment mode is flexible and supports monthly payment, which can help reduce the payment pressure of insurers while maximizing the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of professionalism: This is especially important, because insurance is a highly professional industry, and many Internet products can be insured by customers themselves. In this case, there will be many misunderstandings, and in the field of health information and employment, non-insurance employees often add their own subjective consciousness, believing that they are healthy or fit, which will lead to many potential liabilities, including the risk of being denied insurance.
I myself have done insurance telephone sales in "Tencent Micro Insurance (TMI)", a kind of Internet insurance broker platform, which is very responsible to tell everyone.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, but unreliable is human, and the Internet channel has no professional staff, and there are many sales misinformation.
For example, a 1 yuan insurance will provide 600,000 yuan, a mobile phone insurance will be provided, and a 6 million yuan life insurance will be provided for free, but these marketing strategies are not wrong. However, they will not tell the insured person that the first month is 1 yuan, and the second month will be paid according to normal fees. They range from 20 yuan to 200 yuan, and many clients are not clear about what they paid for a few years.
You think you can spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company pays 600 million.
If the mobile phone is free, it is only delivered to the special insurance number such as 66666 or 88888, and if the SMS is sent, it is not reminded by others.
(This is another pitfall for the insured) To get a free 6,000-dollar life insurance limit, it is short-term. If only relying on this, without other commercial insurance, if it really happens to have a life-threatening disease, 6,000 can do what? It cannot solve the problem, and the life begins to run naked.
At present, the misunderstanding of Internet insurance sales is also being severely punished.
Therefore, from a comprehensive perspective, the platform is not a problem, and the product is not a problem. The problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salespeople.
It is suggested that the subject should consider the matter in a comprehensive and careful manner. In fact, many offline insurance broker companies' products are broader, and the opportunities and products are more, and some products are also more favorable than the Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers, insured offline products, and saved the cost of insurance for each person at 2,000-3,000 yuan/year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
Me: Mingya Insurance Realtor, with 3 years of enterprise management training experience, served more than 1,000 enterprises users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies, and would personally tailor insurance products for customers before insuring, compare prices for customers in the course of insuring, and try to win the best insurance results for customers in the course of insuring, compare prices for customers in the course of insurance, and do the job for customers after insuring to make customers feel safe and secure.
Grow with each customer.
I hope my answer will help the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance supervision department, Internet insurance is insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance process by clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured does not need to sign, and the insurance adviser does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insured independently.
Although the insurance of the Internet is not "ceremony", even if there is no printed contract, the effectiveness and legal validity of the electronic contract are not affected.
This kind of model, a bit like "telephone sales," has a fatal problem, that is, the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "mediator" we choose is a "mediator" that can be with us for many years and will also provide services many years later?

From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of defamation and insult, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can all be tolerant, but we must eradicate this evil.
If you don't look at the party and the faction, the first thing to counter is this uncivilized style.
From the time you started asking me on Facebook to become friends, and then to post comical posts, and then to try to post the location of my home and the name of my father on social media, I have taken an unfriendly attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me every day for six meals, but also continued to discuss me with your so-called friends on Facebook in an undisguised manner, commenting on me in an obscure and humiliating manner, my appearance, my body shape, my good breeding, and so on, I... I... I...
I didn't know that later, I received a number of friends who posted a picture of your Facebook friends and statements with sexual harassment components.
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can't continue to be silent.
After I reported the news, you didn't stop, but you became more arrogant.
I don't care what political background you are, or what status you are, in our society, it is necessary for men and women to respect each other.
Yes, you can continue this kind of humorous, concealed, humiliating, insulting speech, or you can continue to say that you care about me, or you can continue to say that it's not harassment, or you can continue to deny that it's not your design, or to continue to make all kinds of offensive statements.
Yes, I can't, nor can I prevent you.
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and figure don't need you to judge.
I even don't think any girl would be willing to let others humiliate her to get famous.
My friend asked me, how are you?
I said so, and you will not believe.
I think no girl will be able to say that she is still alive after being so mistreated.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic ethics will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of man.
I cut some comments for you to judge
You should not be able to impersonate yourself by yourself.
I can only say that you are a civilization's enemy

The surrounding area is not bad, but there are few hardware stores in the restaurant, and the restaurant has a mediocre taste.
This elevator is also very dumb, just like having a serious illness. Negative 2 to Negative 1, and it goes back and forth, and it keeps interrupting me to go down to the first floor. From the safety passage to the first floor, it is also very dumb. It directly goes to a furniture store, and the furniture store closes, and the safety passage cannot go!

U.S. Three航母集结中国周边 最强大的武器罕见访问关岛 2022-01-17 多维 多维 亲中共媒体多维报道: 中美关系最新消息:最新卫星图像显示，美国三艘航空母舰正在中国周边集结；美媒还披露，美国海军的武器库中最强大的武器之一罕见访问关岛，向印太地区美国的盟友和对手释放重要信号。
According to the China智库“南海战略态势感知平台”, on January 9, a satellite found a U.S. “Carl Vinson” carrier warship near the巴拉巴克海峡.
The Strait of Malacca connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform predicts that the "Karl Vinson" will deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the F-35C fighter aircraft and the CMV-22 “Falcon” carrier transport aircraft on the “Carl Vinson” carrier.
The USS Carl Vinson, which is currently sailing in the Pacific, is not the only warship departing from the United States on January 3. Another warship, the USS Abraham Lincoln, departs from the United States on January 3.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C Air Defense Squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Air Defense Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two frigates, the U.S. Navy currently deploys the Ronald Reagan (USS Ronald Reagan) in the Asia-Pacific region.
Among them are the Missile Cruise Ship "Chengprang Lake" and the Missile Destroyer "Stark达尔".
U.S. Three航母集结中国周边 最强大武器罕见的访问关岛 2022 年 1 月 17 日，“南海战略态势感知平台”公布了最新卫星图片，显示美军的三艘航母正在中国周边集结。
(微博@南海战略态势感知) The United States deploys three frigates in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon rarely visits Okinawa in 2022. On January 17, 2022, the US aircraft carrier flight route.
According to CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy’s stockpile visited the islands last week, a rare occurrence.
The USS "Nevada," carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
U.S. Three航母集结中国周边 最强大武器罕见访问关岛分析称，这是向印度太平洋地区日益紧张的局势中的盟友和敌人发出的一个信号。
This is the first time that the US ballistic missile submarine has visited the island since 2016, and it is the second time since the 1980s that the US has publicly visited the island.
Three U.S. warships are assembled in the vicinity of China, and the most powerful weapon rarely visits Okinawa. China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea in recent years.
The picture shows the island of Yongsheng in the South China Sea.
(Forum on the South China Sea) In the statement, the U.S. Navy said that the visit of the俄亥俄-class nuclear submarine "Nevada," this time to the islands, strengthened the cooperation between the United States and its regional allies and showed the United States' capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and commitment to the security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
Missile submarines are usually called "boomer submarines".
The movements of the 14 "Rayon Submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secret around the ballistic missile submarines makes the "Red Flag Submarine" the "essential survival weapon" of the three-part system, including the launch field ballistic missiles in the United States and the B-52 and other nuclear-powered bombers.
When talking to friends about the recent Meta fall by 26%, the value of the company evaporated US$25.10 billion, Zuckerberg responded, "it is facing unprecedented competition. Why?"
Meta (originally Facebook) is a real advertising company. Its income mainly comes from advertising. Today, the advertising company that makes money is one that has a traffic channel.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and so on, whether they are any kind of functions, are meta traffic channels.
In addition, Meta is also the largest "affiliate network". Many advertisements are attached to Meta's advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, because the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta can't get the user's data information again, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is friendly to users, and will be obvious to users whether the App allows it to obtain its own information. Most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
If Google knocks another blow, the impact on Meta's income will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in the previous Meta's income growth has been weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it exists).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's income comes from China, mainly from the contribution of companies in China.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about a dozen people, and there are several in mainland China.
In order to expand overseas markets, Meta are all the advertising channels that cannot be avoided, and the money spent on Meta is mostly spent on Meta.
Interestingly, now TTT is one of Meta's main competitors, but in the last two years Meta has been able to make a lot of money from TTT.
All the local agents are helping Tencent to advertise there, and Meta in China is also doing well.
I haven't gone to study recently, but I won't be better than before.
Chinese companies have passed the stage of massive spending overseas.
Third, the expansion of new flow channels is not successful.
Facebook is getting old, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets are not only interested in income, but also in the future.
Clearly, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg told the "zero universe."
The Yuan universe is indeed one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the Yuan universe is long. This story is not enough to support Meta's market value for two or three years.
Therefore, in the next two years, Meta should be a difficult period.
Although Facebook is now very prosperous, it has 1 billion to 2 billion US dollars in revenue every year. In fact, Facebook is very worried about its current situation. It is not good or safe to compare with other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although his several social software have a high daily active user, they are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of rapid development of TikTok, Facebook has no confidence, and the disruption is just a blink of an eye.
And the concept of creating an unattainable universe has no chance of success in a short time, so Facebook is very dangerous, and this is also why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company again and again and again, but I think his choice of track is wrong. It is a one-way street.
