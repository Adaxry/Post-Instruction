The goods cost under 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the goods value...
I am #PRS_ORG# Gymnastics and that is no problem for me.
Only one number or instruction should I provide to track the package for you.
I have ordered the #PRS_ORG# for 249 euros a few days ago...
She costs 179 euros today.
I honestly find it very disturbing.
Can I cancel the order and resend it for a better price or is there another way to sign?
In principle, I also think that children should not assume a parent's role for their little sisters.
However, I find it great to get in touch with the small.
Quickly, quickly, quickly, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are associated with it.
As long as they can still be self-sufficient, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is occupied for the short time and it is OK for him, that's good.
You can best determine whether this is right for your children.
It is not so that he K2 wickeln und stundenlang begleiten soll.
Rein is probably questionable.
Perhaps the psychologist's statement is also true.
Because if something actually happens, such as a fire, an earthquake, an alien invasion etc., it would really be too much responsibility for K1 to worry about K2.
Of course, if you want to take a risk, that's your choice;)
Help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime or thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost all of the action, but I don't want to fall for the title any more... maybe you know...
The story revolved around fear and how to overcome it.
At the beginning of the story, a farmer commits suicide by suffocating himself with his own food and going to his grave.
The case is being taken over by a commissioner following a short investigation into his therapists.
The commissioner has a small niche that also has fear (before the fire) and lands at this therapist.
It gets more personal and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is assigned to go to the site of the suicide and to document it and put the photos on the internet.
In the end, however, it turns out that this therapist is treating a kind of underground therapy group where the patients are implanted a chip in the brain that suppresses an anxiety centre in the brain and ultimately forces the patients to make extreme choices.
(One woman springs from the window with an intention to commit suicide)
This is described in the book as "the fight".
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic of the one who had a fire.
That is the depth of the work I am certain that the book was written by a French author / author.
If anyone knows about this action or can reveal the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the password for my WiFi.
You must contact your man first.
It can take time.
What steps must I take afterwards?
Is it also possible to return the prize?
Kind, 4 j., Splitter under the Daumennagel
Kind, four years, has cut through the whole length of the wood splitter under the Christmas tree (side).
They have tried to pull him with a pin.
Very difficult to catch.
Did not slip and got done.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chances.
Today it is going to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of digital decoders and sound modules on a head plate, we can achieve resolutions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can thus be used in almost every shape of H0 and 0.
LocSound 5 decoders are available with all relevant lengths and come always with a 11x15mm gross "clamshell" speaker.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multi-protocol decoder.
It controls data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, there are 14 to 128 steps, as well as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoder is automatically connected to a designated digital centre.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to delay deportation
New Omikron cases worry politicians and scientists in the UK.
All eligible adults in England are due to receive a deposit by next year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to get tougher with coronavirus testing in light of rapid rise in coronavirus cases.
Every adult in England should receive a booster dose by the end of the year, as long as they have been taking it for at least three months, Johnson said Sunday evening in a recorded video message to his country.
So far, the yield date is at the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to help the agencies speed up their work in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the Omikron variant, Johnson said, urgent measures must be taken to strengthen public health protection.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose.
Now stop it, Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, the rise was 65 percent. dpa
Will the entire amount be refunded from the purchase price?
I want everyone to use pronouns
I have sent an application.
Today, the invitation came via email.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but something more complicated.
I have smiled at him and it is either a man or a woman.
**I don't know how to write an e-mail now.
Can you help me?
** I am an outsider and I also want to stay away from officials.
Conclusion: each should stand with pronouns.
There are a total of 5 books.
Four go.
Only one thing I don't buy today
Obviously, the store had a lack of customers.
How can such a disaster last for nine months?
First on the #PRS_ORG#.
It has already been in use since ca.
No more 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books on the website and then sent them to #PRS_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to add 2 euros to your order and put it in your account.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I will write something about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something from the sky.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence.
One theme that has nagged at me for a long time and unfortunately, too many victims are not helped, or we can't help them.
I'm absolutely clear that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are a few things in my job that make me more anxious than if I can't do anything in such a situation.
I see the blue dots, the blood, the exhausted eyes...
But even in conversation with four eyes, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of responsibility, fear to leave the new social environment, fear to entertain the children.
What I always wanted to make clear, partly because I am very close to the tears, all can live without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to take simple violence.
I often wish I could help in every case... I know that I can't.
But it never happens.
Please, always think about it, that without violence you want to live is so obvious.

Why do we love the already announced two concerts?
Football Bundesliga: Derby derby between MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg and Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick, there was laughter.
Again nothing: The Riesen in Crailsheim lost again within three months - and so!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with regard to the Pokal defeat at the end of October: "We still have something of a hangover."
However, after the game, he did not sit down - instead, he chose to congratulate himself on the basis of the 61-72 (28-38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Wobei more than the naked result the art and way of the appointment disappointed.
Stellvertretend is a statistic that puts the whole dilemma to the test. The three quotes alone amounted to 13 percent, four tries (all by young Johannes Patrick) at sage and written 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick's answer: "We were just not focused enough after the victory in Teneriffa and we didn't practice what we were trained for."
For example, to play the ball.
In contrast, his opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted in a different way: "A good game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It feels like there are 10,000 people ahead."
There were only 750 spectators at the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they came at their cost.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team to victory.
The best player I have trained," Gleim praised.
While in the Patriots' own team, the performance stars such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) struggled on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22.15) did the Riesen prevent a total collapse and came to eight points, after which they had already returned to 39.59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Viel Zeit zum Hadern bleibt glücklich nicht.
Already on Wednesday (19 p.m.), the Riesen will take on the skyliners Frankfurt, with a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We had another email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I already reported it a few months ago.
All fitness tests were rejected.
We have been informed and written to them again.
We have already reported this half a year ago.
Always like from the east: Max Raabe is 59
He conjures up his audience with new interpretations of blows from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on the programme "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he should dare.
In fact, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig on Sunday.
But nothing happens.
The planned concert is postponed in May 2022 - "on urgent request" to combat the coronavirus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season will also have to wait, as the website of the singer, who today is 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchestra.de) say.
From January, the artists then want to collect their 2020 works due to the pandemic.
Built in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, on December 12, 1962, Max Raabe has already sung many times as a child.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the orchestra together with the municipal councils.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of puns and songs in the style of comedian harmonists.
He was awarded many times with prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged"-Reihe (2019) - exactly like his success album "For Women Is No Problem" (2013) - the second place on the charts.
He has created it from scratch in the mainstream.
Always elegant, the blonde hair is tightly wrapped back and adorned with a label, is Max Raabe from the current German-speaking music scene not to be forgotten.
Since 2020, he has been on tour with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück". dpa

Bundesbau Ministerin Klara Geywitz: There is no new housing through negotiation
The new Federal Minister of the Interior, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the agreement, as it was demanded in Berlin by a popular vote.
With a settlement comes no single new housing, it only changes the ownership structure, Geywitz said in an interview with the Tagesspiegel (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain payable in the next few years.
Private landlords, tenants or housing associations are obviously the best protection against a monopolistic image.
In Berlin, the SPD, Greens and Linkspartei coalition will set up an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the popular vote.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz closed talks with the FDP in the parliamentary coalition about further tightening of the housing law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental subsidy until 2029, a reduction of rent increases in squeezed housing areas and the implementation of rental subsidies.
I will talk to the justice minister as soon as possible.
However, if the market does not collapse, "we will discuss further steps with the coalition partners," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 tornado deaths in Kentucky
There have been numerous tornadoes in the United States.
All alone in Kentucky could face more than 100 deaths.
The pictures there remind me of a war zone.
On Saturday night in the US, several tornadoes have been reported, and possibly as many as a hundred people have been killed.
The storms caused a 320-kilometer-long chain of white smoke, especially in the state of Kentucky.
After a visit to the disaster area, Governor Andy Beshear said that everything was all over.
House, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Industrial plants, dächer are in the buildings.
It's hard to imagine that it's actually possible.
He is alone in the state of Kentucky with as many as a hundred dead, official figures continue to rise.
Hello, I just saw the one you are selling.
That is very sad.
Will she still produce?
Or is she completely out of the running?
Is it possible to order this display in another country?
Where do you want to meet?
If the delivery does not happen in my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I can only order the curtains now and send them to Germany, are they in the warehouse?
I had sent back an article and received a response, and I wanted to know if the contact form is still open or is being processed, as I still have not received a confirmation.
Companies pay compensation and change advertising
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a compensation package, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative to offer their employees financial compensation.
This means that they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, who today are calling for financial incentives to be offered.
Even the alteration of advertising slogans to appease the public - following German example - is to increase the willingness to go to the doctor for a Corona infection.
He has been transferred to a company.
That doesn't make his situation any better than mine.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He did not even look at his old position and searched for something else.
You can do it too.
And that he didn't like at all: naja egal.
He didn't find his job too good.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That is then legally relevant.
I take a screen shot.
Good day - I have interest in the boone table, white.

Thanks to the damp grass, coffee milk and milch specialties can also be prepared.
Help with first campaign
Boron to the grave!
I just milked for a group of four friends over the search bar and want to drive my friends wild in an exclusive campaign for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big waves are coming, the surfboards and their motivation are written down, each individual act thoughtfully and now I am writing about the first encounter of my own stream.
The premise is that the people are to bring a fountain from Gratenfels in a small village near the Thuran Sees.
The further action will be developed there.
Some miles from the village, the villagers are said to have a group of goblins that they are supposed to chase and lock them in a cave.
I want to give the players the opportunity to confront each other on different topics: manipulation, actions, threats, early awareness of the danger, which always affects the players.
Group strength: Eight Goblins, two with spears, six with clubs and swords
At no point in the match do the Gobblins forget to help the team in a huddle and flank to the three left and right. The striker stops the ball, while two players with crosses stop the ball.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are under pressure, I have two solutions
First, the heroes were found and killed by the son of the sorcerer, a half elf.
Of course, the car is gone.
If necessary, this half-back with two of his crosses will score and help the team.
The car is still there, everything is still there.
How does her Deus ex Machina solve the problem of solution 2?
Is the encounter a stepping stone to heaven?
The group Goblins will play a decisive role later, so it is not just Kanonenfutter.
EDIT: wow, I had not counted with so many responses, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee that many of your ideas will be buried and now I also have more trust in my narrative.
I have built the lamp again.
And again together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to send her back

Ich bin genervt von Sky Sport F1
Hello F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German sky has been increasing, so I want to breathe a little.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted midway in the F2- race to start the F1 coverage at exactly the right time.
It was far back through the delayed start and the postponement of the timetable that we were able to plan the last ten minutes as well as the final (planned) decision.
It seems, however, that from a legal point of view, F1 is following in its footsteps and must therefore restrict itself to everything else, so that Sky DE will not have a chance here.
However, despite this, Sky UK may have to make up for lost time.
However, a small concession: The commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well-received the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident.
Then there was a rule change for commentator Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, who did not know that under a red flag the streams can be switched.
Although this situation has already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that Verstappen should be allowed to switch gears as appropriate, according to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately realized that Verstappen has this opportunity.
I think such elementary rules should be known by anyone who watches F1 on pay TV.
It is not the first surprise rate, which is now possible according to rules or agreed upon, both have steady uncertainties on the subject of rules.
In general, it does not appeal to me with the simulated commentary style of Roos, but the taste is there.
But I really like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
There are constant Albernheiten, both of which simply look amateurish, such as the coffee shops of the (uninterested) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UUuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the last sentence brings total gloom into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, the advertisement is simply overhyped at Sky, in which Sky is the only channel going into the advertisement, as you can only get the German toner without commentary after the race.
ServusTV or ORF does not.
These two networks also make less advertising than Sky, and as a free TV channel.
It is certainly necessary to put on gloves and boots for their work, but I cannot see through the holes on my own.
The original Sky Sport F1 programme is also very strong and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-language channel that F1 overtakes.
Unironically, RTL is making a better job of the four races that they still have to overtake.
For all intents and purposes, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it could be with a reliable broadcast.
Mich would like to hear your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# Pendelleuchte, Messing und mehrfarbige Glas x 1
Hello, I have an article that was due last week and is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me that it will be Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check an email and send it and she has never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on December 12, 2019.
One of them has already proven a mistake after a relatively short time (the product has a loch on the upper part of the shelf).
I want support.
Floating pumps make a sudden appearance in an aquarium in addition to oxygen.
It is also possible to control a filter system via air.
This series is offered in three variants.
Take a look at the table at the end of the session.
You can see the performances there.
If the pumps are strong enough, the whole system can be operated.
Owning a large aquarium can make pumping with 2 or more outputs a breeze, allowing more expansionists to be added.
The MK series has one, two or four seats, depending on the model, but also offers the option to set up an accent in the aquarium, for example with a ceiling fan (you can find them in the shop) or with a decor that turns the air openings into a function.
Here would be a stone wall, moss or similar.
The MK series has a special, special construction and ensures low operating costs.
The installation is very simple.
The lid is attached with a 4 mm hole to an adapter... and it can be removed.
The roof should be the same, or higher than the Wasserspiegel and should be outside.
The lower part of the door should sit as low as the water level should allow.
The wind blows through and the ventilator is set.
This would prevent one drop of water from running backwards into the bucket...
If you want to go outside, as other people do, you should be covered and protected from fire
The Pumpen of the MK-series are empty power packs that consume little energy
Even if we give the working time with 3 days, the packages will be packed every day and the packages will also be picked up here every day.
Light travels well, it goes very quickly.
We just want to give people a little bit of peace of mind, just in case something happens.
It would be so, not everyone has sympathy for the entire staff who also work in the running... of course here no Corona halt.
Please do not judge me too harshly, only because the delivery has been delayed.
Of course, man is happy about these holidays, even if we are at the moment... they have been difficult
This is also very regional.
You are not alone, you stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times to come.
How long does it take to make and without arms?
Can you also place the beads in hell?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronauts daughter and moderator to the world
The first American in the world, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short flight into the world.
They were transported from the racetrack system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on Saturday.
Start and landing of the ten-minute flight were found in the west of the US state of Texas.
Among the brilliant blue sky, Bezos took the newly returned astronauts by surprise.
Welcome back," Bezos said in a blue space suit as he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers then turned around and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were traveling at 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who was flown by Blue Origin's racquetball system, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were guests at the company, which had other four passengers pay for their tickets: room service executive Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not inform.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission.
He has worked hard at his competitions and has to do everything himself.
She just laughed, said the 74-year-old with a smile.
Michael Strahan was also excited.
He would like to return to all at least once, the moderator said.
New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometers high
The racket system "New Shepard" is completely automatic.
As the capsule descended from the rocket, it reached a height of around 100 kilometres above the earth, temporarily with severe dizziness, before the redundant object was finally engulfed by giant water jets.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers over the earth as the boundary to the world, but there is no internationally agreed-upon rule.
It was already the third successful all-out flight by Blue Origin. In July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old descendant.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was there, known for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy CEO of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of turning a blind eye to the environmental impact of the commercial space tourism business, while ignoring the well-being of the human race and ignoring the climate.
According to Knopfdruck, you can easily determine whether your 'Smart Stone' will always look the part or whether your entire colour palette should be played with.
Moving to the far right, the leopard shines a bright light for around a minute before turning its back on the nearest decorative colour.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone"-Leuchte is maintained throughout the year.
In a different environment, her light even works particularly well – just in case the days are too short, you can count on it.
In winter, please only rely on no snow to prevent the solar module from functioning.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the AA format, which will light up when needed.

Perfectly true:) I don't need anything else?
They just need the tracking number in my mail?
Someone who works in chemistry or studies chemistry
I am currently studying Biochemistry in the first semester and I find the subject fascinating, and I am not at all tired (I have already had the organic chemistry practice before me).
I have of course already been informed about career prospects ahead of time, but at the same time I also wanted to study for promotion.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, particularly concerning my job prospects.
On one side (Studycheck etc) you always hear superb offers and the job is completely sought after, on the other side you always hear from unemployed biologists and incredibly poor jobs.
Therefore, I would be interested in that:
(1) What is your current job?
(2) Are you satisfied with your work or salary?
(3) Was habt ihr Studiert/Welche Ausbildung habt ihr gemacht?
(4) Do you still want to do it all the time?
Many thanks for your answers!
I am currently quite uncertain and plan to withdraw from study in 2022, and to get a training in professional informatics.
If you have experience, write it down:)
Extra stress for holidays and weekend breaks
This topic came to me last week.
But now I have to use my long weekend to myself.
For now, a letter.
Not only during big holidays such as Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress at work.
As it seems, there are even more busiest days ahead.
It was like this: Last week, Mariä Himmelfahrt was "arriving" in Switzerland.
On Friday most people and businesses go on a strike, which is semi-official.
Last week there was also a long four-day weekend at home.
What was the last week?
Overall stress.
Lauter E-Mails, who still crave outing, are invited to come and have a look, wherever you are.
Weil... ja weil?
Because "next week then" sounds so much like it should not be?
Or because people all want to go to the movies as much as they do in a normal week?
Not only was I there on Wednesday, but also very hungry.
What should this self-reflection be due to holiday?
So why don't we have a holiday when we shouldn't have?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent.
My question is simple: Are only we Swiss?
Is this our reformed evangelical art?
Or do you know it in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld celebrates Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is happy on Christmas in her Thuringian home - but she has no memories.
The beauty, even if it's not snowing in Erfurt, just goes for Ilmenau in the Thüringer Wald, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will fall asleep by pretending to sleep with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
But by the sinister days, she still has something to do: "I have not eaten for the first time, I have to finally eat."
NEKTON-Bio supports the sustainable breeding of the Mauser and the reindeer breeding programme.
NEKTON-Bio contains all the essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio has a glowing and shining appearance.
The vast majority of the food waste in the household is ultimately attributed to food poisoning.
From the point of view of providing an abundance of food for the creatures that live in the wild, the breeding of an endemic species of eagles is a particularly rich and varied source of food for the birds of prey.
For a functional change of diet, sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements are necessary.
Most of the animal deaths that occurred during the drought are caused by poorer or deficient diets and/ or lack of vitamins and minerals.
In the synthesis of NEKTON-Bio, the unnatural relationship between the amino acids in most plant proteins is explicitly accounted for and calculated.
While the use of NEKTON-Bio should not cause another vitamin preparation.

Still not working
DDR working model Altbau E-Loc E 95 03 DRG/DR, which was in use in Schlesien and Mitteldeutschland, is believed to have been commissioned by the model manufacturer ME Heft 11/1968, with special features and parts, and looks good The E 95 section of the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRB) is a heavy goods locomotive of the German Railways Company (DRB), which has been involved in the construction of some of the heaviest coal trains in the Schleswig-Holstein network, possibly also by the engineering company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are engaged in work
The Deutsche Reichsbahn had commissioned AEG in 1924 to design a locomotive for the track, capable of carrying 2,200 tonnes of coal and 530 tonnes of passengers and goods with a speed of 45 km/h.
The speed limit was 65 km/h.
In March 1926, the DRG agreed to the delivery of the 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens cranes with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives, numbered E 95 01-06, were delivered.
All those who fought in the Second World War and found themselves back in the territory of the late DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were repaired in the Soviet Union.
She returned to Germany in November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn improvement works Dessau, all six locomotives were inspected.
In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01, E 95 02, and E 95 03 were commissioned, with the remaining locomotives being used as spare parts.
In the first place, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 were built in larger numbers.
First as regards the E 94, it was not possible to increase the number of construction workers, and the E 95 was put on hold.
First, the locomotives were stationed at the railway works in Leipzig Wahren.
They came to Halle P. in 1960.
They were put on a special tour around Kohlenzügen from the ski resort in Richtung Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated regulation of the locomotives becomes increasingly problematic.
So it came to pass that Schütze remained calm during the negotiations.
Then, the man on this locomotive had to lull the engineer into a trance with hammer and plank.
Schäden an den Fahrmotoren kam öfters vor und führten zu Monatelangen Ausfällen bei der Lokomotive aus.
By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new locomotives available and it was not planned at the time to switch to electrification, the state railways were able to use the old locomotives and most of the Splittergattungen, so the E 95 were put into service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn Elektrolokomotives only wanted to run them by one man, which would have presented a problem with regard to the operation of the locomotives due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the view.
After Mitte 1969 the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were withdrawn, followed by the E 95 01, which left service on 5 October 1970.
The previous new designation 255 001 has never been used.
All locomotives were removed until the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the museum's future museum locomotive E 77 10 at the Halle depot.
It took some time for the authorities to convince those responsible at the state railways that the E 95 was a museum car.
In 1979, the first serious operation of the locomotive began, with the goal of presenting it to a railway museum in RAW Dessau.
Since then, she has been working as a museum locomotive at the Dresden traffic museum.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
The locomotive will be displayed at the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, members of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have worked on the locomotive's construction.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at the museum in Arnstadt with a new inner and outer restoration, with the transformators checked and five locomotive engines working.
The locomotives were stationed on the Schleswig-Holstein railway until 1945 and were gradually withdrawn to their depot, where they awaited redeployment on the basis of their satisfactory operation and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were transported to the Mitteldeutscher Netz in Leipzig.
The main area of operation was Schlesien
Handcraft model H0 in OVP, function well, opting for optical maintenance on site is necessary, equipped with spindles, grinding tools!!!, very rare handcraft model, very small production, the assembly may also come from the small clothing company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packages can be marked with labels and colors.
Yes, the F-elements are there
I have received a book from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle part is held by two hands. Unfortunately, these are too sharp and the balls cannot be mounted on the hands.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle part is held by two hands, which are unfortunately not produced.
The middle part does not fit into the existing halter.
I also got new ones.
When will they disappear?
No flat.
According to the montage director, they were only to bad
But that's exactly what it is.
Main purpose is to fulfill their purpose
They are not flat
Can I get rid of this?
Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a house fire in Oberbayern.
In addition, a serious damage in the six-digit Euro area has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had spread from a garage on the outskirts of Kinsau (locality of Landsberg am Lech).
According to the information, two people were taken to hospital with mild smoke poisoning on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not come from a possible fire accident.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the investigation.
But it comes later
And I have to pay again for shipping costs
To combat fake news - Biontech CEO publishes impf photo
Uğur Şahin posted on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first encounter in early 2021
So far, Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin has not publicly acknowledged his impending departure.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his crown.
The illness of a friend has moved him, said Şahin.
Mainzer company Biontech CEO and co-founder Uğur Şahin has published a photo showing him receiving an injection against the coronavirus.
There were false information on social media that I was not invited.
In fact, my wife and I received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine, wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on LinkedIn.
For some months, I have been waiting for friends to take a photo of me, so that I could rid myself of the false accusations."
So far, he has refused, because the communication should not be about him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was very touched when I learned that an old school friend is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting against a serious Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family are not impressed, wrote Şahin further.
He did not ask for the reasons.
However, "the most common reason seems to be fear, which is often driven by false information and distrust."
Angst lasts only hard with facts, sometimes it's better to share personal experiences.
In an interview with the German Welle, Uğur Şahin says he is not impressed.
However, the video was recorded in December 2020, as well as the Deutsche Welle itself.
It is not lawful for me to get the impetus myself," said Şahin at the time.
There is a priority in Germany for the removal of the visa.
Gradually, the priority has been raised - and the Biontech chief has been allowed to resign three times.
Fire in a power plant: Ten thousand people without power
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday night: no more power and, in many cases, no heating.
There was a fire at a gas station.
After a fire with serious damage in a heating station, thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to endure 24 hours without electricity.
The flames reached 41,000 people in several municipalities through the fire.
The spokesman for Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous traffic jams had been caused, which had finally been overcome late at night.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered places in schools and called for nanny helpers.
The sender expressed his gratitude to those affected for their patience and assistance.
We are very conscious that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigade and the THW for their unremitting efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the fire protection department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few days, as Westnetz-mountain-mountain-mountain-mountain-mountain-mountain-mountains will be able to resume some operations only temporarily, he explained.
According to company data, a technical defect led to the fire.
Power returns
According to Westnetz, the fire, which broke out at around 7.15 a.m. on Friday, badly damaged parts of the 10,000-volt power plant in Neunkirchen, Seelscheid.
There are necessary rehabilitation and repair works there.
Parallel to this, a connection to a 30,000 volt spindle has been made.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is once again restored.
Since Saturday, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have again been affected by the storm.
More than 20,000 people from Neunkirchen Seelscheid have been sent to the hospital from 3.30pm.
Since 23.15, the power supply to the affected areas has also been restored.
Over 80 Monteures from Westnetz and partners were in use.
After the construction of a contingency fund for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called on neighbours to help.
It is now important that citizens and citizens in their neighborhood care about elderly or vulnerable people, and share information with local fire departments in case of need, explained Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU).
The focus was on the residents of old cemeteries when creating and operating the collective.
In addition, according to the authorities, emergency places have been set up in schools for people who could not afford to take care of themselves or for whom the connected medical equipment required medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.

It's about the sunset #PRS_ORG# in blue.
I hope you have a beautiful day and stay healthy ♡
I can't put it on the table.
It's about Custom #NAME#.
There are three visits.
We wanted those with tables to have a seating area of #number#
We have 155cm diameter.
Today, my #PRS_ORG# came, but I cannot separate it and thus shrink it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise I should send her back, because she is not qualified for the purpose.
I would love to hear back
That's really easy!
Then we do it!
Can you send me the receipt by email?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, before the purchase, I had not started the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Can I do this now?
I find it almost unbearable.
So we are not surprised

To make the flowers smell evenly and pleasantly, you should wash the leaves with a bit of soap, salt and finger nails, rinse them with clear water and discard them.
Before you take the pinsel for the first time with a new color on the model, it is recommended to wear 2 to 3 stripes.
You can no longer see this on the side of the bottles or on a hopper.
The first line on the page
Ziehe den Pinsel gleichmaßlich Strich neben Strich.
Leichte Überlappung der Farbsichten sorgt später für eine gleichmäßigen Fläche.
Vermeide swims slowly in and around the pond.
This leads to unrealistic areas.
One model is not a giraffe.
Start with the black colors.
They could have done so sooner.
Metallic and metallic colours come to the end with a separate pin.
Otherwise, it is possible to get even more beautiful metals by mixing them with normal colors.
After a day of climbing, the rest of the group take a rest.
The models can be seen through the decals or embossed images.
From royal insignia on aircraft to ship names and vehicle emblems: the decals give the model the last sip.
Bring the decals in the correct order, as long as the blocks are still well accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be preserved or cleaned before it is dismantled.
More important than the right tool is time, patience and a calm hand.
Every dog needs a decal and stick it right.
Decals are also called washboard pictures because you dampen the backside of them briefly with water until the tracing paper dries.
Then you only need to take a small piece of paper from the paper and place it on the corresponding place on the model (which you have already marked).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you tear the tape off.
Attention: Always check if the picture is right before you peel it off the paper so it doesn't bite you, knit or tear.
Upscale water with a household substance.
Attention not for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly when I start reading something else, then I can't read it any more and have to quit and join it again and search for the place I have read it.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get this email?

Because the lamp came in three individual packages to me
Thanks a lot!
Then I will buy elsewhere when the money returns.
But do I return the problem?
Kinderwunsch behandlung bei PKV / What is a "Confidence case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in child labour for a while, now as it relates to the payment with the PKV, it suddenly stopped.
The sequence:
We had applied for the children's desire to go to the PKV in advance and received the use of 3 attempts.
The attempts were restricted in terms of time (e.g. annual cycles, success, etc.)
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was corrected with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and after 2 (successful) attempts, we still did not get the PKV.
We again submitted the cost reduction to the PKV and received another three attempts.
After several other attempts (we have made more attempts than promised, and the most successful with the PKV) we reach the bill at the PKV and receive the terrible surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to make 3 attempts.
The explanation: With the drowning, the remaining two attempts of the first use failed.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to AGB, "the insurance case begins with the treatment, ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The experts in this round are:
Who has the right to the PKV (only three attempts are allowed) or we (five attempts are allowed)?
* The PKV needs to point out to us that with a birth the further attempts will fail?
* Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case?
The lack of fertility (due to blocked eggs) is not passed on to the first child.
It would have been super if the experts had given their opinion here.
Many thanks to Eure!
Could you please email me the three varieties and tell me how I find them best?
In order.
We will no longer order them.
If they add the profits from me and my friend #NAME# (the same address), they obviously lost good customers.
They should be allowed to continue with their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the class told me that the payment was cancelled and now you have to tell me that I must send it back.
I can probably do nothing about it that my comforter is completely ruined for me
Can you see what the class wrote in the screenshot?
It is clear and obvious that the refund has been made and I still have no refund per #PRS_ORG#
You can set your manager to have lost two regulars.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our home from his account.
We won't do that anymore.
No, the defect is only apparent after a few months.
An umbrella must be used normally.
Otherwise, they cannot sell him as a souvenir.
Unconditionally, the wage rate of 24 months is valid.
No, it is not possible for me to pack in another way.
I will get rid of the debt and put him on the waiting list for the Transplant Company.
Good day, I have a question for your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are usually accompanied by additional hockers, but unfortunately we cannot find them for you.
Can they help?

What exactly is a low budget film? There is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia says:
>A low-budget film or a low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little or no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find rich listening of Low Budget films on the net, like on Letterboxd.com.

Unfortunately, nothing has changed in the waiting position... then I will come back soon, because it simply does not work here.
Hello
Halber Siege" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half-success."
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the press service of the Evangelical Church (epd).
EU has not stopped confronting the issue, explained the Berlin-based research institute Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This sluggish state - Belarus does not give up completely, but the EU feels like a winner - it may still take a while.
The handling of people on the border is not in line with the European human rights convention, Bossong said.
There seems to be an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by single EU governments.
If the EU as a whole does not commit itself, this costs the rights.
This development also delayed the continuation of the union.
She apparently can't get over the fact that a member state in the head is trying to do something," as Poland, which does not even have access to the EU border protection agency Frontex.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its foreign policy on the border with Belarus: a basic agreement on asylum policy will be evaluated, as the line "boundary protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt at border crossing
According to information from Poland's border protection, migrants have again tried to reach the Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and returned to the border, a spokesperson for the authority said on Sunday.
Polish officials said they had thrown stones at the migrants with sticks near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, 52 attempts to cross the border within 24 hours were registered.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had already crossed the border.
Tens of thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or are trying to do so.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko of being a manipulator in Minsk, promising them entry into the EU with the prospect of joining.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed border controls.
The EU imposed sanctions on Belarus and threatened to suspend flights that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, the EU Commission is sending representatives to people in origin countries to prevent travel there.
The most important element of the EU reaction is the pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
′′ From this, the EU has thrown its market power into the whirlpool and exposed its commitment with tough measures and extraterritorial sanctions to operate".
Moscow must also account for political costs.
The Belarussian society is probably not prepared for the fact that security forces regularly shoot thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
Max Verstappen is said to have broken two rules during the race according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has appealed.
The silver plates displayed the same two rules in the last Grand Prix of the year.
The protest is focused on Max Verstappen's apparent mistake in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he should have overtaken in a straight line.
Another appeal was lodged against the judgement at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed as planned.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the last race and became the first Formula 1 champion.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the drivers in front of him had overtaken him.
I test it.
I speak to the bank and submit my application to you again
Thank you for the support
Free entrance for members: Europe Park organized by SC Freiburg
The Europa Park, the name of the Europa Park stadium of the sports club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg.
How the park is divided, members and members of the sports club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community can visit the European Park this day for free.
In addition, there were treats for drinks and sausages.
The last leg of the trip was made by the Trikots on this day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red balloons ensured the perfect clean lines," said the park.
Since the beginning of the 90s, the cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has been ongoing.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europe Park, the partnership has once again shown itself how well things are going.
Strange fans who have fun together on the Achterbahn are confirming that, says European Park owner Jürgen Mack.

He spends about 2000 pieces of bread every year.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many curious situations.
This makes the pre-Christmas time always a bit lively, he says.
And with the guts?
Unless I become a customer?!
Finally, I received a false delivery and now I have to pay the full price.
Then I will also evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both are made from meat that is grilled in a hot pit.
And both have their names.
In German, an equivalent could be "Dreher", which is not so easy to pronounce.
Problems with Glasfaser + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass door for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable WiFi network.
Earlier, I had a DSL connection of 50 Mbit and used Devolo's DLan, which has been receiving and sending data for up to a few outages.
The new Glasfaseranschluss sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan Modul, which is connected to the FritzBox.
However, on the other DLan Modul, which sends the WiFi, not the full 500, but I myself remove myself from the house with the Modul, so that less comes (use a dose, which removes 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms from the other Modul).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new glass fiber connection is now even slower than before (~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which seems to use a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similar losses.
Can someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is "lost" through the power supply?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely inconvenient to move LAN cables in the house.
I really am confused about why I have created an extra account here.
Therefore, I would be more excited about an answer.
When is the time to change the tire
Whoever thought that now there would be calm in the stock markets, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to showcase their latest tricks to reassure their customers about the rate hikes of the past, negative interest rates are also falling.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, lost a long time as relatively small.
Now she has halved the freebie and even offered to pay for a day's wages.
In a first step, the limits were only applied to customers of the Postbank corporate branch - on 50,000 euros in cash and checking accounts and 25,000 euros in day-to-day accounts.
However, these lower borrowing costs have fallen for the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesman.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "novel individual agreements with customer representatives".
The Commerzbank has already entered a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as did in ING Germany.
For the time being, the direct bank DKB has reduced the freebies to two levels, first to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
In the end: More than 100 banks have received a freebie of 25,000 euros or less after figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda bank in Berlin is worth 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which have in the first instance appealed against this ruling to the Berlin Supreme Court.
Now it is being debated in the banks whether the Institute should make possible revisions - for the case that the upper houses also explain the negative interest rates on the basis of unchangeable principles and pay millions of bank customers back.
The table was provided for 8 people instead of 6 for 6 people.
This is for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston uses a whole beauty arsenal
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is full of climbing and climbing.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman in the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" for the year.
For them, the success of the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" in 2021 is the result of a lot of discipline and work.
For their appearance, a whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers are on hand.
After all, so Aniston, she could have a chip on her shoulder (ja, literally: a single chip from the bag).
It is actually a good thing that she allows her female and male fans to fly at the same level.
Maybe because they just got lucky and still love each other.
And the baby's wish list has grown.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she will become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who questioned me have no idea why I can't go.
It was really sad.
Hope that success and humility will do well.
Unfair end to a career Räikkönen must accept
Kimi Räikkönens' withdrawal from Formula 1 remains a matter of concern.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne put his hands up and winked at the noise from the crowd.
That was it.
After a lap and a slight gear change, Räikkönen had to give up his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after notching up nearly half the lap time.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport elite.
At the farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children also left the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönens' biggest success was winning the world championship in 2007 in Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich Holt wins 60th World Cup cup - She takes second place in the doubles - Sport
The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen's mark of 94 success is the goal of the Bob pilot.
I have been through this countless times, I had to win by one and a half races this season, so I could reach Cortina in 2026, said the double Olympic champion from the BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days in Winterberg.
He first defended himself on Saturday against Johannes Lochner's attack of five hundred thousand, in which he was ranked third.
Then he changed something on the material position and pushed out a big lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team consisting of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer(BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he challenged Britain's Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We are taking a bigger risk today and are enjoying it, said Friedrich, who also won his 22nd Serie Sieg.
The Stuttgart-bound Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner came fifth this time after the race.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in fourth place in the first race.
If I wanted to do something else, I would do it, said Lochner.
Nolte with Heimsieg - Podium for Jamanka
At her heimbahn, Laura Nolte took the third win in two seasons.
After failing to reach the fourth place in the Monobob on the previous day, she reached the world cup final on Sunday with her partner, Deborah Levi.
Zweierbob Olympian Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thüringen came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She occupied the first place in this winter's Olympic qualification.
The Wiesbaden woman Kim Kalicki finished in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first place in the world cup, I am superhappy that Mariama takes me.
I'm super excited about the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but today's start times were okay," said Burghardt, emphasizing that "it is not only advancement, but there is also a lot to do."
Jamanka grins a little about the not entirely flawless vehicles, but says: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the curtains in the store and could now buy them!!!
What should I do?
I have not even met him and therefore cannot even leave him.
Last year, due to Corona, I had other problems and never had time.
And now it seemed that what I was very angry about.
Look at the chat about the Asare Sitzbank.
I want to take it back and then order again, because it's already reduced :)
How does the delivery start?
There was nothing like this long delivery time on your website
No, only if I tip
He was taken away by his colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures from the wrong time.
But we want to give the gift even if it is a new one
And not the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write down and maybe it's one - or the other...
I am 24, have PTBS, full-time student and dog mama - but I don't really think my dog is actually 1 to 1 with me in the kindergarten.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has taken a 2 grade and has been depressed (but is now in therapy).
Last night, I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we have been very shaken and it was beautiful.
I have helped him with this (weil Hand ist im Verband).
He is very down-to-earth and we are currently seeing fewer (1 to 2 x week) things that make me so happy and fulfilled.
My dog has just had a bath, I have cooked him and now he is lying on his back and is a bit relaxed after I applied the heat lamp and stretched for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and they're just a month away from each other.
Now also housework comes to us, which we naturally divide.
But cooking is just as much work for me...
My PTBS illness is just getting better, I'm walking pretty well and I'm getting real.
Not good, but I'm real and almost symptom-free.
My uni is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow I will have a written test I have yet to make and overwhelm an anatomical hour for which I should at least prepare.
And next week I will have a medical examination on Tuesday, and then there will be nothing in my calendar and not in my head because there is no place left.
Also this week: just over a month, then holiday.
But then what happens?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so this is what happens.
I believe that I just need to be so stressed out that I need this inner peace.
I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I don't...
Does it work?
Honestly, I am extremely grateful that I don't have to work.
In fact, thank you very much, I cannot do it in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I believe that some of it has something to do with the mental load of women, and therefore I thought I would find a soulmate here...
I hope you have a splendid evening, the week is almost over!
I have received my order today, unfortunately the whole other colour plus the surface is engraved and the dining table has a touch.
The first delivery was exactly as described on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we now take the table, will I get another color?
The email to cancel was sent on December 26th #number#.
Two times.
She was not confirmed.
Mal was completely different: I remember at school that many religious teachers did not believe in God and that it was only another subject like math or history for them.
For me, this was always something strange, perhaps because I was born into a Christian family and I always believed in something.
How does this affect you?
Maybe you can also tell about work and or study colleagues with different stops.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is easy to separate.
Yes, there is also a training plan.
But is there just one physicist who doesn't believe in relativity?
If you don't believe in religion, what do you want to do then?
What is culture?
The question is not private.
Can it not be changed or not? I understand English well
That is too long, so I will look away
Great, thanks.
I expect a reply by the end of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Filmsuche Hilfe bitte
Hello people,
I want to see a film from my childhood (24).
I think it's a film for young people.
There are two parallel lines in the film.
For one, the modern (real world).
For the other, the past (or the Reich of the Dead).
In the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the Caribbean).
From a certain cause, the path diverges and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Reich of the Dead who wants to live in this Reich.
I also think the stationery of the soldier.
At the end, both soldiers believe I.
If you say something, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has slept on the couch for week 1.
Fast forward: life still: D
Relieve yourself.
So a child holds more out than you think.
For this reason, everything must be done quickly, no slip-ups, more often than not, but not for a minute's consideration.
That is amazing!
Fresh air in the room.
Good memories.
No cuts.
Achso and our had no sleep, but always a bed.
Watch out for your child if it is running away.
Is the head on the side?
Can something come from the bottom?
Or is the face directly in the mat?
You can check if everything is in order.
We are all big, and as my husband is to the world, it was like putting the kids on a sleepover.
In addition, we have "stocks" for you and have already sold many articles
But why only 20 euros?
Hello, I have already written with a colleague of yours and so far no reply.
It is about my necklace, which arrived recently (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right blade doesn't fit in the tight.
I would like to contact you as soon as possible.
The problem is currently not being used.
To be completely clear.
RBTV has much to offer.
And yes, I myself know that not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
All it is is just that the politicians of this channel are now all over the map.
Fast every format is responsible (ok), but then go at the same time on a large tour.
It was said that you were a "non-independent" Internet sender.
Zitat Arno: You want to "keep your mouth shut."
What am I now?
An 0815 telephone number, trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marahs Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, Simon and Etienne are included.
Of course, people should continue to apologize.
One Krogmann completely lacks empathy and tries to make a profit from the exploded apartments.
How should you find it all?
If you like it, I find it lovely.
Ich bitte um Rueckruf, weil mein geliefert Holztisch zustellt wurde.
Korpusbruch through failed delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
As a Tröster at Bauchweh or just for crunching – My little warm friend is very versatile.
Kirschkern-kissen are a traditional home remedy for warmth-inducing ailments, as kirschberries are very good at absorbing heat and returning it.
The internal cuts can be warmed up easily in the microwave or in the back of the hand.
The bright idea makes the use particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel comfortable even if it doesn't go well for them.
The Kirschkern-kissen with reference is only suitable for the following application areas:
Before the warming of the kiss, check the type of scent, soaked or burnt, and notify the person immediately.
Please take care of the heating before leaving the room!
In the Microwell at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (information from the Microwell manufacturer)
Directly after the rise, the warmth spreads evenly through the socks!
Finally, the kitchen returns.
In the first applications, it can be difficult to achieve a slight color change, but with repeated applications, this becomes more difficult.
You must always stick to the specified heating method, as long as it can cause damage in the long term or at higher energy levels (explosion and combustion resistance!).
Before heating the kissing sensation in the microwave, you should check that the manufacturer's instruction allows the use of muscle relaxants.
After the heated news items returned to the subject, please check the temperature of your armchair for babies (max. 43 °C)!
Do not use it on acutely or chronic wounds, blisters, fresh cuts, blood sores and open wounds as well as on people with lowered blood pressure.
For existing high blood pressure, heart disease, venous disease, diabetes or cancer as well as for vaginal dryness, consult a doctor before using.
If they open their mouths and lick their ears, worry about the product and the licked ears immediately and unconditionally for children.
If the product is used for babies under one year, the temperature of the child should be regularly monitored to prevent irritation!
All the cases connected with the product are to be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authorities of the state in which the user resides.
The focus is clear and is visible in the machine at 30 degrees Celsius.
Please note the hygiene symbols on the product!
Darmstadt to Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the football Bundesliga.
However, Hannover 96 are from the league.
Ingolstadt is also not under the third coach.
Jubel in Darmstadt after the late victory in the spitting game, happiness in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed start under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and ca. 3 years old) was no longer charged by my network.
This has been bought for about five months, so it should still work.
I thought the network alone can also operate.
Fehlanzeige, der Akku ist leer, und das Laptop startet nicht mehr, trotz eingestecktem Netzteil.
Then I disassembled the battery, but I don't have anything here either.
Do you have any ideas?
One new battery is installed, but how can I use the laptop online?
Is it different?
Many thanks for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I buy it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# booth.
But we don't know how high the seats are.....
On a tour and despite all the preparation?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
20 liter fassungsvermögen schlucken auch große Foto-Ausrüstungen ohne Probleme, die mit der gepolsterten FlexFold-Teiler sicher verstaut werden können.
And what else do you need on a daily basis, thanks to practical access in the individual configurable indoor areas, and easily distinguishable from the photo editing.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to the version 2 (V2), the series presented itself in a new look.
The minimalist design has a sharp edge - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some of the most innovative solutions to protect the interior of the rucksack and still allow quick access to the photography equipment.
This works with two methods: One way is to use the card slots that can be locked with the MagLatch closure system, a brilliant solution for effective protection already used in the Messenger bags.
There is a zippered pocket on the front side of the rucksack, containing a zippered shake from metal with adjustable straps.
In contrast to most rucksacks, Peak Design has thought of different "fill stations": there are four anchor bolts, which can be stabilised with screws.
Is the bag full, just take the highest balls, he is rather empty, a bit.
Clamps and hinges are also magnetic.
So the bag can also be securely closed without the handles being tightened.
The second option, on the other hand, also differentiates itself from everyday backpacks by others: besides the zipper pocket, there is also a slip pocket on both sides of the bag.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of ordinary rucksacks with access from above - you don't have to feel the contents anymore!
At the same time, this simple detail enhances the casualness of the rucksack: if you don't only take your photo, but also everyday items or travel packages.
In the everyday backpack, you can individually configure the interior space (more details here) and separate them both from each other - and through the two openings, also independent of each other.
You can also take out the backpack from the right side of the body, for example to access the camera lens on the right front panel, while the all-star players will stay in the left half of the backpack and not come at all.
Bequeme, uncomplicated tragegurte help here.
And because the front pockets of the rucksack are also made entirely from recycled 100 per cent nylon, which is drier, the contents then exchange themselves when it is to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I forgot the email from your support.
Today, I received an email from confirmation for the submission of the
Contact has been established since the speeding up of the removal of the false information.
So far, I have not received any message.
I would like immediate relief.
I have already written to the third support employee, and in no case have I received a confirmation email as promised.
It is about the return of the wrong delivered custom #NAME#
It is only a matter of time before the wound can be healed.
It is not an option for me...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
Wishing you another beautiful evening
Hello, my order number is #number#. When will the article be delivered?
Delivery and payment was on 12.1.21.
Mir was given a completely different light than I asked for
Please call me
If you give me the chance, I will give you a big order, but at the same time I will keep the damaged furniture and not return it.
And that last year was different than I could have imagined and could not have resolved and cleared up.
But I don't accept the damage as compensation.
Rotinger brake components are designed for the claims of the dynamic driver, who needs to be able to rely on their brakes under difficult conditions.
Rotinger bremscheiben are made from guss and then mechanically processed (mixed and ground).
All tears are displayed in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain tears and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical notation, a special production program is set up, which is directed by the characteristics of the original montage.
The comfort and efficiency of the seats are enhanced by this method.
In addition, the heated oil streams increase the effectiveness of the heat exchangers, which improve the cooling of the brakes and brake lines.
The aesthetic characteristics of our distant scenery underline the character of each car.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event took place in the history of the west coast.
In winter 1848, a man discovered a man on the southern bank of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the newness spread quickly and triggered the so-called "california gold rush" of '49.
Thousands came from Nah and Fern and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and florest cities in the state.
Vast amounts of gold, silver, and copper were concealed, jewelry was smashed, and casinos and hotels were nearly empty overnight.
Everyone wanted to have a say in the country's future.
For many, it was: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrott)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who is looking for a name in the West.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, train horses, and build companies.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the nearby river flows and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You must meet your pioneer colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with them.
Coloma is a fast game with many reasons to win.
You are simultaneously launching your campaigns, you have to keep your resources in check and build a table that is working for us more and more.
The buildings on your map allow you to be more efficient, take additional measures, or change your rules.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridges, you can develop your individual playing style with helpful adjustments.
Coloma played for a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California sought to regain its official status).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players choose a location on the game plan from which they can take actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers at the vacant positions.
If a place the majority of pioneers have, he receives a shock!
This deactivates one half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players switch off actions, such as winning resources, driving vehicles, setting up traps, searching for flights, building bridges, opening shops and positioning snipers.
If all campaigns are closed, the pioneers return.
The buyer starts each round at a new location and changes the existing actions.
This goes on for a long time, until the buyer has moved five times, so that each place is covered once and the year ends.
There is a shootout, in which the players Coloma have to defend against a devastating avalanche.
If the players have enough revolvers and pay regularly, they get housing.
However, if they fail, they receive less housing or end up at the shelter.
After the third shot, the game ends.
The player with the most points wins!
With free shipping, I can take up to the dimensions 35 x 25 x 4,5 cm the shipping type, mail order (games printed).
Mostly other DPDs and with delivery tracking (games spoiled, with flies enveloped and packing paper).

Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychische Gewalt, sexuell Missbrauch, Machtmissbrauch
The ARD documentation is currently on my Twitter timeline, and I have already posted it.
The children's psychologist Michael Winterhoff is enthusiastic guest at talk shows and holds European contracts.
With his book "Why our children are tyrants" (2008), he triggered a heated education debate.
Former patient: birds and teachers now make severe accusations against him.
Please bear in mind that the film is difficult to rent.
And I am very grateful that so many people are now thinking and acting differently.
No one should ever take power over the child!
Our goal must always be to give Freiraum to the child for his development and to make the child's role as big as possible, as is possible in the situation.
Brrr, I still feel chilly.
Holetschek: States warned over test obligation for three strikes
Health ministers from the states will decide on their next meeting on a national roadmap for the three-pronged test obligation at their next meeting.
Health Minister Klaus Holetschek (CSU) said, "We need to get to grips with the issue of whether and when the test obligation can apply for three times in a row as quickly as possible."
The 2G plus upgrade for three mobile phones is "not only medically beneficial, but also provides an additional relief," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has said that "he will make a proposal to the health minister's conference next Tuesday". − AFP
I also want to return the lamp
How do I feel best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# seat very nice, but I can't see how high the seats are.
Can you please help me?
I can't buy anything more through my #PRS_ORG#.
Report: Ups, it's a mistake.
Shopping on the #PRS_ORG# website.
My data has been updated.
Can this happen?
What is being described as *Awareness*, that is, the ability to perceive wisdom.
These are with a frequency of ca. 1 to 1000.
Most often, it comes to heights of fear, some to the sight of pictures, and rarely to the understanding of suffering.
Relevant for this topic: Kaiserschnitte are operations that have a very high rate of awareness, as they involve dealing with a very low blood sugar level to protect the child from hypoglycemia.
Vorangegangenene Episoden von Awareness sollten bei der Narkosevorgespräche erwähnt werden.
Specific anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) have a slight increased risk.
**EDIT** Love all, this commentary from me describes awareness correctly, but had **u/Nitemarex **per definition no.
Their comments were wrong.
The chair is wrong.
We can't help the 20 euros either.
These are statutory minimum wage agreements.
The absolute minimum would be to return the false seat.
This is also standard in the area of e-commerce.
Please check that at least the defected seat is returned.
We then sell the second seat privately.
We also lose money.
I have already sent you a message that you have not answered.
Another question.
In the order and billing, the goods will be delivered to my choice in one room.
The sender is company #NAME#.
I was just there.
He told me that she only delivered to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If that is the case, I must cancel the order, as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
I didn't call you?
I had a question formulated
Theater historian Günther Rühle dies at 97
He has become a theater critic and an administrator.
Later, he wrote a monumental theatrical history.
Günther Rühle, 97, died on Friday.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly written: "One old man will grow up".
The disturbing diary of a long-distance farewell from the world, led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle is the message that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads, "I have already used my life debt here."
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most common are European plywood pallets, mainly used as flooring in Europe.
They will be certified by the European Palette Association EPAL
According to data from Austria, over ten million palettes were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was at a good 79 million euros.
How many palettes are imported annually to Austria is not known

Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had received many great tips for the perfect gulash a week ago.
There was Christmas and it was delicious and delicious!
Thanks again for that:)
Now I have come to the taste and I want to cook a roll for Silvester for the first time.
Today I will set a rabbit fund.
Do you have any tips for me?
Remark: I don't have a hat, but only a big top.
How is it going on?
What is with the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is no longer so good, but that's OK
It is about a reduction of €#NUMBER#
I have already been informed by mail on January 18 that the reimbursement has been completed.
But until today, the money has not entered my account.
Would you like to examine it?
Where there are still Christmas trees in Lübeck
For many people, gans or ente are part of the Christmas day like the tannenbaum and the decorations.
Do you still have a plane?
The time is almost up.
We promise you that you will still have a Christmas treat in the room in Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a subdued tone is mainly concerned with the warmth and intensity of the Gitarren sound.
These symptoms are perfectly reproduced by the valve reactor control.
With the volume, gain and master volume controls, you can individually set the desired pitch and adjust the retention of your sounds.
Ferner provide the boosters of the VT+ series with a one-of-a-kind power level regulator, which allows you to reduce the throttle response without changing the gain or compression.
Further up, it has already been said that with the POWER LEVEL REGULATOR one can even float a reserve of performance.
Thanks to the power level regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The ticket counter can also be used as a line entrance.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression when using a speaker or when taking pictures.
The AUX port can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so that you can jam your favorite songs.
There is also a tuner function - they do not need a separate battery.
If you also invest in a VFS5 foot pedometer, which can also be used to call the sounds per step, adjust the effektblöcke and change the tempo of the corresponding effects.
For live use, this is actually unavoidable.
With its new power pack, VOX goes on another step in the future!
But it's not like that at other places.
Does it then return the lamp?
Is it too low for her?
I would then like to send her back.
Can you help me further?
And the clothes?
We will receive another update to the exact delivery date next week?
Hello, they have been singing at the #PRS_ORG#
If it doesn't work, I would also be happy with a pen or pencil.
Under circumstances, I find an associate for the furniture.
I don't need anything more than 1,000 euros for goods.
I have received my order and I should have known that shards were part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# spiegel (Tür) at the intended angle.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting period has not been completed
Is there a premium customer status at Euch?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreement
According to Iranian sources, progress has been made in the negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
Both sides are just now getting to grips with the issues that are on the agenda, according to Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Ali Bagheri on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development" because at first there was not one single agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were continued for almost an hour.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia are taking part in the discussions.
Another US delegation is also in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - federal state now with highest Corona index
Thuringia has dislodged Saxony and currently leads the country in terms of population.
As a single federal state, the value is over the 1000 mark.
As a single federal state, Thüringen has stayed away from the Corona brand on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections for 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has the highest income in the country, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the number of inhabitants in Thüringen was low, but more than 1,000 were left alone.
In Thüringen, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported in a day.
200 seriously ill with Covid were treated in intensive care on Sunday.
One weekend can lead to complaints.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and are coming up with new cases hardly any more.
I understand that.
It is possible that delivery will only start in early March.
I must knock it off and put it in the package and send it to the post?
Do I have to do anything else here?
Exactly what I want to avoid, so I write to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own cost.
8 euros is a fair price in my eyes.
It's time for change
I am delighted to welcome you, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall of Europe on a fantastic day!
Where is the post?
If you look at the activity in the last few months of the MBundestag, you can make a decision: It is not extinct.
We arrived in a winterstart and extended the summer lake for a few months.
What is the problem?
Yes, what happened?
Most likely, this will simply relate to unhappiness, as some things have disappeared and how we generally feel about it.
In recent days, the impression has emerged that many here still have a bottle on the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community is asking about the MBundestag, which they want to keep alive.
The challenge came from u/edizVEVO, which has been active on this project in recent days and has found just one, a simple shrine.
After agreeing to disagree, several people from the community have found common ground and are determined to rebuild the project.
However, I would like to once again appeal to all to take part, just as this project can have a future.
We have set up a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can discuss and work on specific things.
The server can be accessed via this link.
Purpose:
How should the MBundestag function in the future?
* What orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
What should we do in the future after going abroad?
How should new members be introduced?
How do we create a fair voting system?
I am pretty sure that I have forgotten something, but not really bad, so we have the Discord at the end.
If you have passion and time, come to the Discord, work with and decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade so that it will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/cluttered for my taste.
For this, I have already made another appeal to you.
I made it together and then noticed this when I looked at the filthy room.
Very sad about it.
I hope this is resolved and I have received full compensation.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the daydream #PRS_ORG#, is there the same in size, 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# has to promise me that the false alarm will be caught up.
And I ask you to leave now.
I don't have a designated package, but I can arrange to drop them off for collection - they'll need to call #PRS_ORG# to figure out how that works.
#PRS_ORG# can call me at any time to arrange a meeting.
Does there exist an instruction for the montage?
How long would I have had time to worry about this or decide on the return?
How does she respond to the question of why she is vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I liked.
She herself has been vegetarians for a while, which is probably also quite rare.
I myself have been vegetarian for some years.
On the question of whether I always want to be vegan, and whether Vegetarianism is a planned step forward, I honestly answered without much thought.
And, of course, I longed for me to support the vegetable garden, but at some point I realized that I was ultimately supporting animal agriculture.
Therefore, my decision must be made.
At that moment, I had the impression that she was mad at me, she defended veganism and said she knew where her meat came from and reduced meat consumption as a vegan.
Now I ask myself, was my answer "plump"?
How does she respond to the question?
If you feel like a vegan and want to get into conflict without starting one, do so.
It greets a harmonious vegetarian (;
It is not an exception to section 312d BGB.
You do not have to comply with the legal requirements for the emergency service.
I do not attend the meeting on the date indicated, and I do not attend the meeting on the date indicated.
Because I cannot be there due to a meeting, this too unfortunately cannot be changed.
Can you please refer me to an alternative exit.
I will return from 01.02.#NUMBER# immediately.
Lahnsteiner Wehr für Wasserrettung gerüstet: 45.000 Euro Zuschuss vom Land
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz, in the Lahnsteiner Municipal Council, approved a subsidy of 45,000 euros for the new water treatment plant at the Feuerwehr Lahnstein, owned by mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in service since November 2020, amounts to 135,000 euros.
Invest in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate has supported us here, says Lahnsteins mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is being used by the Lahnstein force, one of the seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in water and sewage treatment as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one can expect long-term benefits: The boom in the hotel sector in Rhein and Mosel as well as the further increase in the use of the lake as a leisure waterway will bring long-term benefits.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, they have synchronised, deleted and reloaded the app. NICHTS has not worked.
I am disappointed because I have already spent a lot of time on the whole campaign and now I am hoping for help.
Okay, then so.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# in June.
Can I put a date on the order?

Thank you for giving me the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the public service in a similar capacity, I didn't want to go further!
The question of right and left always finds me very confused.
In principle, however, one should say that the state service is more likely to come from the liberal to the conservative spectrum than from the revolutionary left, which should be obvious to everyone.
Of course everyone should be clear that in particular uniform and weapon-crew members should not be magically equated with conservatism, that is to say, that these people should be able to move comfortably into the real world with the appropriate reality, that of course is clear, because you have of course in addition to the average white, many German immigrants with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I am not exaggerating at all, for I am now noticing that there are more and more women of this type in the real world, many of them with a background of migration, women and also homosexuality (and I am noticing that there are more and more women of this kind in the real world, many of them with a migration background, women and also homosexuality (and now I am noticing that there are more and more women with a migration background, many of them with a background of immigration, women and also homosexuality (and I am now noticing that there are more and more people with a migration background, many of whom have a background of immigration, women and also homosexuality, and I am noticing that there are more and more people of this kind, many of whom have a migration background, many of whom
But even these small groups also hold out when it seems like my experience after a conservative approach, and they are proud of Germany and feel strongly about left-wing politics, even if that policy seems to them to be right to do, and they want to be treated simply normally.
Back to the rights, of course, because police and courts are also a part of the society, and they have extreme rights to say whatever they want there, but they should at least be allowed to say whatever they want in a way that does not offend any state-sponsored plans. This also makes me angry.
Of course, there is the danger that even police and soldiers, who have often been involved in overseas missions, will start to panic at the beginning and say things that are politically incorrect.
There is also the possibility that at least some of the rightful owners will also meet.
Still, I think it is good to fight and also with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationalized that I think it is also good that we cannot have any real racist and Nazi in our ranks!
Yes, I did not understand that the other Korb I also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I called, it was not sold.
I have already ordered in November.
However, it was confirmed in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I have previously used #NAME#.
Alternativ, could you still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# Korb for #NUMBER# Euro to Germany or is this Korb in Germany also available.
I always see you as a partner company.

Ordentlicher durch Kind?
Hello, my (w32) is already busy.
I am highly specialized and organized (I am self-employed, very little freelance), but I have long found my life more difficult than it should be to maintain a steady and decent income.
There are always phases where everything is possible, and then and when I feel tired and fall asleep.
But it is actually never so "that someone could come spontaneously."
My husband is (sorry) not much better, but at least it keeps me alive.
The food is still cooked in the regular way.
Now to my question, do you want to be decent with children?
We still have work to do, but this question has been on my mind for a long time.
Because for me, there is no shame in it, it is just not as cute as it should be if there is no visitor and so on.
Does a man have a bigger appetite or stays calm?
Thank you for your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a personality disorder?
I have made an education in the field of software development and have learned since about a year ago.
Unfortunately, I always feel more and more that this job is not the right one for me, for which I have already waited a long time, to start again and study social work.
The problem: I have a self-limited personality disorder (AVPS).
This means that I do not have a sense of self-worth and, consequently, I look down on myself.
I don't have a problem with talking to people at the same level, but it gets very difficult to keep the conversation going and I was even told I sounded ridiculous (I already think better of it).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a streetworker or in the open youth sector, but rather, for example, in the search and rescue or the family aid sector.
I do not know whether the actual working day is really as I have imagined it, and it is difficult to find something online.
The VPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotional), because it keeps crashing whenever something on my code is wrong ("just the most annoying things") and it makes it hard for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I'm going to learn how to do it by myself in the meantime" etc.).
The problems will probably have occurred in every attempt, but I wanted to mention them.
Have you kept the sofa?
Because there is no proof of this.
I wanted a place to go
What did they give me back?
If I have read a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message comes from your #PRS_ORG# authorised this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I had received a confirmation for my order.
The protein contained in the meal, Eiweiß (protein), is absorbed by the bird in its gizzard and converted into its amino acids, which it also needs for digestion.
The nestling photo and the nest building photo at the nest are extremely complex and related to the overall animal's behaviour with a very high level of credibility.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be released during the race, as it can cause disruptions in the race.
In addition to this regular supply of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (Multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (Mineralstoff preparation) will be resumed.

Resignation of a member of the community in favour of settlement
Hello, German,
I have this problem.
On our site, a walnut tree is to be planted.
Also set bail for the community.
One employee writes to me that the fall of tree branches and trees themselves are not part of the calculation.
In the arrangement, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a secure tree.
Can I now leave the statement of the employee?
On one side, I must leave myself to an expert.
On the other hand, the arrangement is definitely clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use these new packaging.
I have received no message
Naja, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you please give me a pen or a pencil?
What was it?
Yes, that is what I believe, only the question is whether I can pay in euros and hand over the keys to Germany
Can you check it?
Payments: Heavy traffic accidents on your own
Recently, a severe traffic accident on the St 2179 between the access point Selb-Nord and Plößberg has occurred.
According to the police alarm (14.03), a car crashed into the opposite traffic.
There are injured.
Okay.
Thanks a lot, then, for being so easy!
Rat and ideas to further career
First of all happy Christmas!
My Christmas is unfortunately good because my favorite head is completely naked, what you can see.
Before I leave here for a short time: I need a rat and from people who know my situation - of course from you.
I am actually making the request as an interpreter.
Originally, I studied something else there and also worked in a field (at least somewhat anonymously).
However, it was too long for me and I had eaten after alternatives that could make me more happy.
At some point I landed at the school and I was sure it was - although the terms of reference are clearly less flexible than in my previous job, but that was okay.
I have now arrived at the third "ich google andere Stellenausschreibungen."
And it's only half a year.
In the past, I have always decided to continue to do so and at least to end it, and then I can still forget it.
But I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month, I completely exhausted myself.
Nowadays, holidays are over, but there is still a lot of work ahead of me.
I always thought I was stressed, but my weekend was also my weekend and my holiday my holiday.
I was free.
And the stress at work was equal at the time.
Now I myself am too stressed about the family festival.
And then these structures stand up, which I add to my nerves.
In principle, it is fun and from outside, the ref also looks good, what feedback and so.
But I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely dims - if it doesn't already do so.
I ask myself whether I want to have done the rest of my job that way - exactly when I got some of my EU contributions here - or whether I should not have gone back into the old area, where I was appraised and I was allowed to take my time when I needed it, and the work was long and boring, but it was paid fairly and done in a team, rather than as a fightback as the case is now.
But then I ask myself, whether I will not be back at the same place in one year as now and unsatisfied.
You think it's all a bit weird, but maybe it was your acting as an outsider or your ideas, as I came out of this situation, which I am completely finished with and almost ready to cry.
I'm not going to make decisions right now, which is likely to lead to nothing good.
But maybe help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, which I already have for the first time.
Thank you for reading and sorry for the embarrassing situation.
I hope my situation is at least somewhat clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has continued to develop, which led to the combination of the advanced modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" system, which enables the behaviour of a heart pump to be perfectly reproduced.
With the VT20X/ VT40X/ VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modelling engine that is absolutely at the top of its game in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology (Virtual Element Technology), which relies on the analysis of the hardware and amp settings, the VTX boosters are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also contain the most numerous Valvetronix valves.
This is partly due to the fact that these are easier to hear than the pitch variations and nuances of a piano.
In addition, the VTX boosters offer a closed cabinet and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only so echo.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct historical facts on the virtual level, up to the point where the amp and effects sound like you have always imagined them.
The perfect combination of Röhren-Sound with modeling technology is the first line of the 2001 VOX Valve Reactor technology.
She herself has since been revised several times in order to accommodate new sound demands, which VOX's Valvetronix series introduced again in 2010 - with more dynamism and numerous and improved enhancement models.
From the hands-on VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed to make all boaters feel like they are searching for a maximum sound diversity here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and the dynamism of a rhythm guitarist: They expect a smooth sound, a nuanced delivery of sound dynamics and Saitenanschlag as well as a prompt response.
During an ongoing analysis, the VOX engineers have discovered that, above all, the endstoppers determine the reliability of a boost, and developed the VOX valve reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor of a VT+ Verstärker, equipped with a 12AX7 valve, forms the behavior that subtler nuances and the sound character of a valve are perfectly reproduced.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic loses to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but they cannot reach the victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven assists from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main focus is also adaptable: with three individually adjustable plazier- and flatbare lens elements, it is completely adapted to the needs of your photo editing, so that it is suitable for every kind of camera - from simple system cameras to full-format lens reflex cameras.
Finally, what is in the pocket, depends on the size of the camera and the objective.
One possible drawback would be a DSLR camera with an attached objective, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
More DSLM cameras such as the Sony a7 series or a Fujifilm X-T2 leave room for additional objectives.
In addition, you can also buy a lot of supplies.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) you can use it for your equipment and for photo-related things.
Drohnen pilots also opt for the Everyday Backpack 20L as a good choice, because the rucksack offers plenty of space for a DJI Mavic Pro including a webcam and accessories.
Vulkan eruption on La Palma: probably longer history
In the almost three months since the start of the operation, the lavatories on the Kanarian island have suffered considerable damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 has been the longest eruption on the Atlantic coast in Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed Vulkans in the Cumbre Vieja volcano has been somewhat reduced in recent days, but volcanologists have not made any prognoses on when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island region, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to state TV station RTVE.
Schäden in Millionenhöhe
In the nearly three months since the start of the eruption, the more than 1,000-degree hot lava has destroyed almost 29,000 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
About 1,200 Hektar were covered by a flooded area.
That corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 people had to be evacuated, with damage estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new landscapes with a size of about 50 hectares were created by the caldera of lava.
The most seriously affected areas were the banana plantations for the island, from which about half of the around 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which were already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectare banana plantations have been destroyed, other areas are heavily damaged, the newspaper "El País" wrote.
Christmas and gifts
Christmas is right before the curtains and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for it.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have been associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the tense atmosphere.
Christmas is one of the few traditional holidays that keep our increasingly fragmented society connected.
The most important thing is to be aware of the holiday tradition of the skink, so that the gesture of the skink, which according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a "community contract of natural populations," is maintained and in context of this tradition can be filled with life.
How Nikolaus the Christkind was born
The protestants were very strong, by which the Weihnachtstage was enveloped with the people.
Previously, on Nikolaustag, arrangements were made for a one or another kind.
The backdrop of this still-lovely spot is that the holy Nikolaus threw three women in a night into his window to save them another life in Spain.
From this unconventional way of sealing, the demand for which is popular in Germany, the Stiefel is particularly good for filling the eyes of children.
Protesters complained about this need, because they claimed to be intermediaries between God and the people.
For these reasons, they are against the institution.
Martin Luther derived from Nikolaus the Christkind and founded a new tradition line.
The focus of the crowd shifts to the evening.
However, most protesters do not see the need for such detail questions anymore, only a few see the need for the same kind of service for Saint Nikolaus as that provided for Saint Martins, with Martins songs and Martins procession.
Today, in Stiefeln, you can find yourself in front of the clock and under the Christmas tree, and enjoy luxurious relaxation all the way.
Various traditions in Christian countries
Records trace a tradition of cheese-making dating back to the 13th century on the day of Saint Nikolaus.
With the Reformation, the day of the church festival is disappearing.
In all Christian states, however, there is a fragrant smell over the question of who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region, whether Christkind will appear on the holy evening or the Christmas man, who in principle is a kind of Nikolaus, who has been associated with certain types of time.
For example, his white lace, which is only slightly worn with the more traditional Assyrian lace of the historical figure, his scuffs, which are pulled up for access to the houses, and the prettiness of the carriage, to get to the houses.
In the Netherlands, the holy Nikolaus remains the central figure at the Weihnachts festival.
In Spain, the holy three kings are giving the keys, while in Italy the Hexe child is said to have led them to the way to Jesus.
In Scandinavia, the dishes are often accompanied by fables, while in Russia, it is the master chef's frost that brings them together.
Here there are not tenants, but three horses that are drawn by the Troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars, Christmas is responsible for the distribution of the gifts.

Many thanks.
Police arrest suspected bank robbers near the palace
On Saturday near the Kensington Palace in London, a man from the police was shot.
Police said callers had reported a man with a gun in a bank and the business of a bookstore.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was later stopped by officials.
There were blows and the man was hit.
He was finally explained at the scene.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
In the case of the Kensington Palace, several messages have been sent.
The palace is the official residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
We also have other members of the royal family living there.
What?
As soon as I click, I will be redirected to your side.

In the Hollywood spectacle, it is the most dangerous objects from distant galaxies that are at the forefront.
However, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: The sun alone makes this solar energy so fascinating - using white or blue light (in six different colours).
The anonymous, amorphous design is cleverly disguised: How a nature-inspired large grey cat presents itself this modern light object at day.
His organisational meetings take place in any natural environment - on the terrace, on the lawn or in the vegetable garden.
He also grows a lot of cabbage and sweet potatoes in his backyard, where he makes a living by selling them.
Major preparations can save you: as a solar powered "Smart Stone", you don't need batteries.
Set the 'Leuchtstein' on a popular, sun-baked spot.
Two roadside stands provide food for those in need.
The matt-washed artwork itself is robust and moist.
Its solar module rotates »Smart Stone« discreetly in its inner, together with its battery and two LEDs - one for white and the other for bright light.
The battery is already charging when the sun is shining on the roof.
At breakneck speed, "Smart Stone" begins to glow; in which colour do you want to be chosen: beside the day's light colour, there are six attractive colours for you to choose from - apart from the colour of your skin.
Finally, the power supply is automatically switched off when the battery is at its minimum capacity, or when it gets worse.
As soon as the sun appears again, the Ladezyklus starts on the earliest day of the year.
I've done this many times and it doesn't work.
Shame, I would have liked to have asked for more from you, but if my chance is not taken, then I will not be calling again.
If it's different, give me a choice.
Only then was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.

The sound reproduction of the LokSound 5 was once again improved.
An adjustable variable PWM pulse frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz is exactly what makes a silent car move – the typical "rumble" comes from the past.
The rule can now be applied to even difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "autotune" function allows the automatic adjustment of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder delivers up to 1.5 A motorstrom for older motors.

Pill problem
Hello beloved women,
I hope I can do everything right, after a year Reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I had to take the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such terrible pain during the period and I had PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave it alone, because I have to take chronic medications that I cannot afford.
My main problem, unexpectedly not the pain, but my skin.
I had received about 200 explosions in my last about two years of 0 to 100.
We were so excited, but I didn't feel it at all.
In the two years since the pause, it has never really normalized.
Perhaps there are some tips to avoid this.
Fresh and without regret, my cosmetics are already there, but maybe that's what someone else can do for me.
Frauenärztin hat mich leider so ernst genommen, und Hautarzt Termin kommt noch.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the book!
Yes, love is such a thing.

I have also tried to eat as much as possible during the course of my illness and have been on milk, cheese and poultry products, because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It can also be good that hormones just drive the fire, but if you want to go all out, you should stop looking as soon as possible.
I had already told her everything.
I have lost the conversation and I don't know what was answered on my side.
I have to work all the time and suddenly everything disappeared...
If the money was there, I would have seen it

110 kV electricity cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the transfer of the new high-tension class to Tann is legally binding.
The government of Niederbayern's planning committee has freed the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayern.
The approximately seven kilometres long cable will link the power plant in Tann in the north of the district and the existing 110 kilovolt power station between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast near the town of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts.
Blue bet number #PRS_ORG# with the sending number #NUMBER# was sent back to #PRS_ORG# with the message "Not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a display is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the further process is now?
Good start to the week!
You can forget that I have already explained this more than once!!
This is a comforter made of glass and all the sides are flat, so the glass and the cardboard are broken
The comforter is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the comforter cannot be pulled up because no one in my apartment can
Thank you for the message
But why only 20 euros?
The origin value of this seat is #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is in all books, so the question at #PRS_ORG#, because it is certainly a general problem
Ref: Training plan (EK)
Hello, colleagues and colleagues,
I have been at school since summer, which makes me happy, but at the moment I still have a lot of problems planning my studies in the field of history.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so I can use the table, the textbook and an OHP as a medium in principle.
In the school, I can only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for me).
I need to plan my hours in a very long way at the moment.
For example, we are currently discussing geophysical factors, and in my case, every hour counts.
In principle, the methods continue to be repeated, but I also don't want to invest too much time for one-to-one lessons (I also don't want to go to UBs).
I always go through the planning from the starting point (what I want to achieve), and then I manage how I can build it (usually I use a work sheet with text from books that my school does not have).
We have read the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks.
So also the workforce.
Maybe one day I can work as an editor as well as you can with the book.
I really like it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I actually would have voted for a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would have done so at least as quickly as possible.
The trade is threatened due to the 2G regulation.
In most businesses, only those who are sick or elderly are allowed in.
The trade is unnecessary and annoying.
He also proposes a possible solution.
From the point of view of the trade association Germany (HDE), the 2G regulation is the most important Christmas business.
In stores that do not carry non-perishable items, sales receipts must be filed, criticized HDE chief executive Stefan Genth.
According to a recent HDE survey of more than 1,100 managers, more than 70% of companies are pessimistic about the rest of the year.
Many had already written about the Christmas business.
What should really be the positive point of the year is now often a lake without a bottom, Genth said.
Manufacturers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their sales in the past week.
It is only available in the life insurance and online market.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The sale with the mask, distance and hygienic concept is a safe bet, said the chief executive.
He stressed that "2G brings us further in the fight against the pandemic."
The current rules devastated customers and required high personnel investment.
He demanded that the ban should be lifted nationwide.
Afterwards, each customer would have to be controlled on 2G (wired or wireless) and would have access to all stores this day.
In addition, in the individual market - as already in the 3G regulation (imputed, generated or tested) - stick-probe checks should be sufficient.
The specialist real estate group Deutsche Euroshop also spoke of a difficult Christmas sale.
The frequencies were last without 2G at about 75 percent of the pre- Corona level, with sales at around 90 percent.
These numbers will certainly fall in the middle of the important Christmas business," said Wilhelm Wellner, chairman of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high number of personnel and administrative tasks, the Center is trying to find solutions and get them approved.
This includes the so-called Bändchenlösung, in which "visitors, for example, once their 2G credentials at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel - can disrupt all businesses." dpa
I recently received the #PRS_ORG#.
The paper has a crate and on the cover is also a mistake, which was attempted to be filled with a good additive.
It looks beautiful.
I would like to return the mirror and have it packed up again and put in storage.
How do I go about the return now?
The light is built for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high bandwidth.
For setting the colour temperature and brightness of the light bulb, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities.
In addition to the reduction of the humidity, there are two standard color temperatures: daytime and nighttime.
It is also possible to manually set the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K and to save it.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
One of the most special moments of the controller is easy and intuitive.
The leech produces a very bright light with a high quality of light, completely free of water.
The 120-degree reflector, which allows you to cover a large area at a relatively low angle, is extremely popular.
Especially in reporting situations in small rooms or in isolated locations.
They can practically adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great piece of work for both filming and in the studio.
The optional DMX512 -Controller allows you to control the smoke in television studios or when the smoke is mounted at difficult locations.
At the back of the glove is the control panel, consisting of tests and a glowing display.
The display shows the current humidity level in percent and the current temperature in Kelvin.
There is also the slot for the NP-F Acquis (not included in the delivery)
Backlight The backlight has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To follow the settings of the individual settings on the memory cards, just drag one of the memory cards over the other.
The flash controller stores the current state of the light bulb when switching, so that the known situation is restored when new switches are inserted - very practical for studio work when the camera is set to specific temperature levels.
Work with battery one of the major strengths of the DL3120 functionality derives from the possibility of operating with low NP-F battery.
These often belong to photographers and cameramen (and women) - so that you can return to existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check whether the battery has enough power - it is a battery tester that measures voltage and current for each of the two battery terminals - for each of the two battery terminals.
In addition, it is naturally possible for the stewards to continue to ensure the safety of the steers over the provided network.
The construction of the shaft is very simple.
They have used a 16mm lens as an accessory, so that you can take a direct snap of your subject.
The challenge is to make a secure connection between the two sides.
The mechanical components were also extremely well made, and according to their reliability and hard work, they were deployed.
In addition, a snowball is included in the delivery.
This is also a bag in the delivery.
So you can buy the lace with all the help you possibly can, without problems, transport it or store it.
Shame, I have gotten and it is too small:(
Party that we wanted to make up”: Frankfurt celebrates its comeback against Leverkusen
Was for a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in the series without a win, Hesse were apparently on the way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then, the SGE struggled, and within a good hour, the disappointment over a disappointing start to the season from the seating area and scored 5-2. "It is incredible, what the boys have done today," trainer Oliver Glasner cheered on DAZN and spoke of a "pauschal lob, to each individual who was with them," from.
There was initially a renewed appeal for Frankfurter, who are now ninth out of nine.
Patrik Schick had led Leverkusen with 2:0.
What happened then, impressed also the SGE coach.
How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner added.
I am delighted with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
As well as defence player Christopher Lenz, who was back on the pitch for the first time since his devastating muscle injury in the fourth game of the season, his team mates praised his morale.
I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old and pleased with the result, in particular for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to see today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on itself, but sees a good situation for the staff.
It is unusual that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top form.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professional lives.
Now you want to "go one step at a time and stay focused" and transfer tasks to this level by the end of the year.
As for next Wednesday, in the course of the English week, there will be an autumn game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky).
I returned the mail to myself because of a mistake.
I have tried to contact #PRS_ORG# and make it happen.
Can it be sent back to me again or must I wait for the money to be withdrawn and the order again submitted?
Unfortunately, I will not be able to make a reservation for me because it has already been very long.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# stage?
Dämpfer für Handball-Frauen vor Quartalsfinale gegen Spanien
After defeating Denmark, Germany's women’s handball players clenched their fists and shouted slogans from the stands.
At the end of the World Championships, the DHB selection beat 800 spectators in Granollers by 16.32 (8.13) and now faces Spain in the quarter-finals.
We were very afraid and had a lot of respect for the opponent, said the federal coach Henk Groener.
We must behave differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the top group with 8.2 points as second behind the Dutch (10.0).
It's sad that we couldn't take the flow into account.
This was a bad game that we have to get over," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the race to reach the semi-finals of the World Championships, on Tuesday, against the second place in the 2019 World Cup, a significant improvement is required in order to keep the dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Another German runner in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Rückraumspielerine Alina Grijseels with six goals.
We were simply not there - not in the attack, not in the defense," said Rückraumspielerina Xenia Smits, and demanded, "Now we must look forward."
Up to the height
In contrast to the previous five matches, the German team was not at the same level.
Fehlwürfe und technische Fehler in der Angriffe und Lücken in der Abwehr hätten für einen schnellen 0:4-Rückstand nach sieben Minuten verantwortlich waren.
Only the widow of actress Dinah Eckerle was so hot that she had to be taken to the emergency room and had to have her throat cut.
The first Tor came from the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-attack.
However, this was not the case.
In the face of the aggressive deck of the dancers, the German women could hardly set a scene - and even if they did, they mostly failed on the strong Althea Reinhardt in the centre of the Scandinavians.
So, the game ended early at 3:10, with Rückraumspielerine Mia Zschocke a little later for a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, however, she can still help.
Only in the closing phase of the first half, the DHB selection came a little better into play and at least five goals were scored until the break.
The only consolation was that after seven minutes at 9:19, there was still hope of a comeback.
Again, the Green supporters in all areas shouted and made it clear to the well-meaning opponent that he should easily win the medal.
As a result, the German team could no longer reach a performance goal and went clear of the park.
DACH-Adventskalender Tag 6: Familientradition in the Weihnachtszeit
As part of the Reddit advent calendar, we celebrated Nikolaustag and took this opportunity to deepen our understanding of family traditions in the pre-Christmas season, the Advent, Nikolaus, Holy Night and Christmas festivities.
How was it at home then?
What about our partners?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is best for the children?
The stump?
Plätzchenbacken?
Tree sap?
Will it be used?
Does the Christmas man come, the Christkind or is the gift just from Oma and Opa?
Egal, as it is, everyone gives themselves a chance and tries to have a good time around Christmas. It is so nice to have a family around.
Does this now have a tradition, or even every year is different: tell us how it happened in your family!
Please send me some sort of transaction number. Or otherwise, what can I help you with
Confirmation... etc
I would like to take a selfie
So as with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Does that happen to them?
The title means that I am working as an ambulance driver in mobile ambulances, in which (to date) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is impfled.
As a result, I am going to have to go to the doctor's office for further treatment.
I answer questions without any time limit to the organisational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, provided they are not personalised (e.g. "I take medication X, which is attached to the infection..").
In my area of responsibility, the declaration for the exemption, the indication (people have appealed to the exemption in accordance with the Corona regulations and have not found any grounds to the contrary), the medical documentation and other things. The event of allergic reactions (I have never happened).
The attack itself is delegable to qualified personnel, for example medical assistants.
In impending months, however, we do not have any here, but "only" (to please God) pharmacy technical assistants for the preparation of impurities, but cannot conduct any impurities, so that I can also experience the majority of impurities myself.
Major "hound question": Amberger knows the solution
What do you want to be a "hunter"?
With this dialect word, from an Amberger, it has been carefully prepared for the BR television broadcast "We're in Bayern".
But unlike many other days, the term "host my?" this time from the callers unerringly.
No, it was not a "man who is nervous".
And no one, "who must go quickly."
This, the people of the TV moderator heard, is completely false.
Why the man from Amberg shared the solution and thus probably also for many Oberpfalzers for the first time.
The "hunter", the audience are told, is a dog with a human face.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, from the Bavarian television station as an expert, confirmed this.
With the inscription, this is a typical oberpfalzish term, derived from the nearby word "houdern".
There was a gap in the education - perhaps even among those who live in Amberg for a long time.
I can't buy any more books for 2 weeks.
There is always a follow up error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have the #PRS_ORG# installed, new, with the PC connected, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing has happened.
Reifenwahl beim Rennrad - really so pannensicher?
Today morning I was full of excitement because I wanted to prepare for my bike tour in the coming week at least a little.
Said, bought and I drove with my racing car, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then it happened, what in any inner city (this time thanks Krefeld!) looks like.
Glassplitter on the line.
Zack, the laughter and my interruptions did not want to participate in the rest of the line.
Since I had no real chance of getting replacement gear and spare parts, I had to turn around and take the first bus home.
War is not as bad as it sounds, maybe it's better when I try it again before the tour.
Now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have been on a relatively long journey over several days, I would be extremely happy to get this problem under control.
Now, in fact, it is not really bad, because the old trails of the former owner (a very nice old man, I got off the bike at 1.30am on the day he bought me the bike!) and the former owner, who had them for years as a suboptimal asset because he had played with them for years.
But if I think I still have to make a change of direction at 80-90 km/h, I'm really bad at it:)
Now I'm talking to an older man at the train station, who was astonished by the fact that I didn't want to run the Marathon Plus; they should be easy.
Of course, the whole thing is very disappointing now.
But are these really so unbreakable?
I now have little appetite for paying 40 euros for a drink, only to be disappointed afterwards.
I still ask myself: I believe I am currently 25x622.
There are also (apparently) at the Marathon Plus Reifen, but the majority is already broad.
Is this a problem?
Or does she want to give me a ride to another race?
The walnut side seems to my absolute! Do you prefer Durano DD?
Thank you again in advance for the help and love!
Auto hits tree: Driver killed
The 53-year-old was hit by his car on the B57 motorway between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car on purpose, according to the police.
There was a frontal collision with a 27-year-old vehicle.
The car of the 53-year-old was then driven against a tree and the man was detained in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to various hospitals.

After the publication of our new High End Breitbänder B 100-6 OHM, there was only one question of time before our SOLO series would also receive offspring.
SOLO 15 is the new sprinter and reminds us of the great images with the B 200-6 OHM.
However, in this building proposal, a passably designed foot directly enters into the room to raise the sound level to the correct level.
This has no effect on the sound and can therefore be adapted to fit the surroundings.
The SOLO 15 is well suited for people who have a maximum heart rate that is somewhat below average, but a surprisingly high level should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not in the position to generate nearly undisturbed large sound pressure waves.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 is loud.
On the other hand, she seems to grow up slowly and impressively for her age.
The SOLO 15 was toned down with a gentle climb.
This is common practice in many countries around the world to improve the high frequency.
Exactly at the Hörplatz, the SOLO 15 is very clear and sharp.
The Highlands can be reduced in colour and the sound can be made more muted.
Thanks to the pitch scale, the positioning of the individual components of a musical piece in optimal stereo three-dimensional space and blending is perfect.
The reference-related extreme low mechanical loss of B 100-6 OHM causes a sense of urgency in his search.
The SOLO 15 not only adds to our SOLO series, but extends it in terms of range and accuracy.
As it is recommended at the beginning, think about the final optic of the speaker to make corresponding changes to the construction with a plan.
If necessary, the rooms can be furnished, and the reduction of the sea speaker must be adapted accordingly, as the supply of materials is again increasing.
After all the plates had been connected (e.g. in the furniture market), you should first drill a hole of 8 mm in the floor plate at the corresponding location, so that later the cable can pass through it easily.
With the help of an Oberfräse, the front opening is now followed, so that the B 100-6 OHM can be joined later.
This opening should take place with a 45-degree phase as close to the launch areas of the submarine as possible.
The four rocket boosters of the B 100 - 6 OHM will receive an abort in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
After that, you begin to build the box and place one of the two sides on a flat surface.
The back, deckel, front and bottom are now covered.
The three reinforcements are to be deployed and destroyed.
The adjustments themselves can vary depending on the demand in terms of material strength, so long as you want to return to the woodshop to make them yourself instead of using 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side will be introduced.
After that, all the plates of the foot, the two sides and the front follow.
Through a passing loophole or a fortress door, the opening of the bass reflex hood and the connection to the back wheel are facilitated.
Finally, one uses a round brush to brush all the cards of the actual box.
The surface of the footplate can also be covered.
In addition, the footplate is fixed with the step of the staircase and, in addition, long wooden beams are attached.
It follows the marking and mounting (2.5 mm bore) of the expansion components of the speaker case and the connection screw.
After the house of holzstubs has been consolidated (dismantled / dismantled), the removal of the tower begins.
This is achieved by simply opening the 35 mm Bass Reflex opening in the back.
This way, the entire and undiluted cable piece is threaded through the 8 mm bore, up to the terminal opening, and can be raised by ca. 30 cm.
In the upper part of the building, the cable leads to the seawater opening and is also lockable there.
After that, the frequencies are prepared and used.
The frequency plan and corresponding access plan can be found in the following document: Montageanleitung Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency is installed and the termination terminal is decorated, the 8 mm cable opening in the inner box is closed, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little trick, you can let small children get up and leave.
By opening the B 100-6 OHM and using a small light bulb, one can check the abdication accordingly.
Now the attack follows the description.
Finally, the B 100-6 OHM is closed and the corresponding screws are fixed.
Here, the polarization plays a significant role, so that the relay (marked cable) must be terminated at the plus pole of the submarine (greater contact).
At the end, the bass reflex is cut to the appropriate length of 28 mm (the length of the shaft) and embedded.
To combat the fire, a matte of the fire suppression material is spread in two layers and stacked in the room.
The opening of the bass reflex channel should be kept open.
Can I even submit an order now and start to deliver in early June?
Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will also host the OSCAST this year!
It is unfortunately not possible from well-known reasons to get more than four people into the studio, which is a higher planning level and explains the shortness of the announcement.
ABER: We will have at least three people on board, so that we can follow the Oscars 2021 with at least seven nominations and hope for a thousand!
