Judge Dugan said she took into consideration factors such as the former teacher's admittance of guilt and lack of prior criminal history when deciding on an appropriate sentence.

A federal judge has ordered the Internal Revenue Service to hand over a list of the 298 tea party organizations that it targeted with broad and often intrusive questions when they applied for nonprofit tax-exempt status. The decision from U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott means right-wing groups are a step closer to being allowed to pursue a class-action lawsuit against the IRS. The agency has admitted playing political favorites with the tax code beginning in 2010, when it began applying extra scrutiny to groups with red-flag words like' patriots' or' tea party' in their names. While those organizations' applications were held up for years, liberal groups sailed through the process. Federal tax-exempt status is confered on groups that serve a public purpose, including issue advocacy, and allows them to promise tax deductions to their donors.

This means that larger animals need more resources to survive, so are less common than plentiful ants, for example.

Earthquakes shake the planet in such a way that the Earth can oscillate for months after the seismic event. This oscillation is caused by vibrations and researchers in the mid-1980s found the hum can drop as low as an E flat, 20 octaves below middle C on the musical scale. In the late 1990s, seismologists found that the planet doesn't just oscillate following quakes, and instead is vibrating at extremely low frequencies all of the time. A team of Japanese and Californian seismologists first suggested ocean waves may cause this constant hum in 2004. They proposed that as ocean waves move in opposite directions and collide they create microseismic activity. But Fabrice Ardhuin, a senior research scientist at Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in France, and his team wanted to put this theory to the test. They began by studying and measuring seismic activity across the globe, including earthquakes, storms and the movement of ocean waves, throughout 2008. During this time, two seismic events

Remington' Remi' Walden, four, was killed three years ago when his family's Jeep Grand Cherokee exploded when it was rear-ended. Jurors in Decatur County, Georgia ruled on Thursday that the SUV manufacturer, Chrysler, acted with reckless disregard for human life in selling the family of Remington' Remi' Walden a 1999 Jeep with a gas tank mounted behind the rear axle. Walden, of Bainbridge, Georgia, was killed when the Jeep driven by his aunt was hit from behind by a pickup truck. The fuel tank leaked, engulfing the Jeep in flames and killing the four-year-old. The verdict came nearly two years after Chrysler compromised with a federal safety agency and agreed to a scaled-down recall of some older-model Jeeps with the rear-mounted tanks. The tanks have little structure to protect them if struck from behind, making them susceptible to punctures and fires. Federal documents show that at least 75 people have died in post-crash

Britain's leading art gallery has uncovered new evidence in its attempt to keep a #1million Constable masterpiece that was looted by the Nazis from its Jewish owner during the Second World War.

Easter is here! And whilst many Australians are enjoying an abundance of sugary treats, many are wondering how much it's going to cost them around the waistline. According to the ABC, the key is to maintain an even balance of' energy in' and' energy out.' This means that the energy we put into our bodies through food and drink must be equated with exercise to burn the energy and avoid gaining weight. A small chocolate bunny contains 2212 kjs and would take an hour and ten minutes of swimming to work off.

It may be surprising how much physical exercise it takes in order to burn off even the smallest of Easter treats. For four solid mini chocolate Easter eggs it would take 30 to 40 minutes of walking to work off the 550 kilojoules. A female of average weight would need to walk for the full 40 minutes, whereas an 80 kilogram male could burn it off in 30 minutes

Materials scientist Ryan Consell studied which materials could create a similar sword. He began by looking into whether spring steel could be a contender for a modern, real-life version of Valyrian steel. It has 0.6% carbon, with silicon and manganese . This would provide a balance of properties including a sharp edge, but a spring steel sword couldn't handle high temperatures. He then moved onto the option of using air hardened steel. It is cooled off in the open air when it's forged and doesn't lose its properties when heated up. As Mr Consell added, Valyrian's colour, pattern and weight make this option unlikely. He suggests Valyrian steel isn't steel at all. Instead, the' best possible match' might be a metal matrix composite.

Last month's average temperature of 56.4 °F (13.6 °C) was the hottest March on record. This was the highest for March in the 1880--2015 record, surpassing the previous record of 2010 by 0.09 °F (0.05 °C).

Methane, the principle component in natural gas, is usually produced by organic material decomposing.\nBut there is another form of the deadly gas, dubbed abiotic methane, that is created by chemical reactions in the crust beneath the seafloor.\nNow scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the Arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane--a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide.\nThe gas forms through a process called serpentinisation . Serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor.\nThe reservoirs are secure, and scientists don't believe they will impact climate change . Instead, they say similar formations could someday be used to store methane, that can later be used as fuel.\nOne reservoir was recently discovered on the ultraslow spreading Knipovich ridge, in the deep Fram Strait of the Arctic Ocean.\n' This ultraslow spreading ridge shows that the Arctic environment is ideal for
