Unlike Christmas, it doesn't fall on the same day every year but shifts around in spring depending upon cosmic events.\nAnd that blood moon we just had--is it pure coincidence that it fell around Easter?

But the ball just lacked pace, Cook was through the shot too early, the angle from round the wicket tucked him up and the inside edge came into play . He cannot admonish himself

Q: I have been suffering from mouth ulcers for the past five months and feel I'm living on Bonjela and mouthwash . I get them all around my mouth and on my tongue . I've been referred to hospital but the appointment isn't for three months . Although I'm otherwise in good health, I'm quite worried.  A: Mouth ulcers may seem like a minor ailment but can actually be incredibly distressing . The pain can severely impact on quality of life, as eating and drinking are significantly affected.  We have a rule in medicine that any single mouth ulcer lasting longer than three weeks should be investigated in order to rule out a cancer of the mouth, but this would usually be an isolated ulcer that does not heal, rather than multiple lesions.  Multiple ongoing mouth ulcers are quite a different issue and certainly warrant further investigation.

Astronomers say the unique event happened in an ancient cluster of stars at the edge of the Milky Way galaxy. A white dwarf star - the dense core of a star like the Sun that has run out of nuclear fuel - may have ripped apart a planet as it came too close, they believe. When a star reaches its white dwarf stage, nearly all of the material from the star is packed inside a radius one hundredth that of the original star. This means that, for close encounters, the gravitational pull of the star and the associated tides, caused by the difference in gravity's pull on the near and far side of the planet, are greatly enhanced.

Sarcasm is often described as the lowest form of wit, but it seems you need the right kind of wits in the first place to be able to recognise it.\nNeuroscientists have identified the area of the brain that is the key to picking up on when someone is being sarcastic.\nThey found that people with damage to the right sagittal stratum - a bundle of white matter that lies between the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures in the brain - are unable to detect sarcasm.\nStroke patients with damage in the sagittal stratum in the right hemisphere of the brain (shown in the image above) were far poorer at detecting sarcasm when listening to sentences, according to the new research.\nStroke survivors often suffer damage to this area of the brain and struggle to recognise when family and friends are being sarcastic.\nAccording to researchers at John Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore, the level of damage to this area of the brain seems to directly affect a persons ability to detect sarcasm.\nUsed effectively, sarcasm can provide a devastating put down.\nBut it turns out

The U.S. Supreme Court's arguments on Tuesday over same-sex marriage will cap more than two decades of litigation and a transformation in public attitudes. Based on the court's actions during the past two years, a sense of inevitability is in the air: That a majority is on the verge of declaring gay marriage legal nationwide. Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's pivotal member on gay rights, has been marching in this direction with opinions dating to 1996. In his most recent gay rights decision for the court in 2013, rejecting a legal definition of marriage limited to a man and woman for purposes of federal benefits, Kennedy deplored that U.S. law for making gay marriages' unequal' When states appealed rulings striking down their same-sex marriage prohibitions, the Supreme Court declined to intervene, most notably in October 2014 when it denied appeals in seven cases on a single day. Instead, the nine justices are hearing in Tuesday's oral arguments an appeal of the sole decision from a regional U.S.
