Libya: Plan for presidential election on 24 December close to collapse
Libya's chances of staging its first presidential elections on the long-planned date of December 24 appeared to collapse on Sunday after the body overseeing the election said it was unable to announce the approved candidates due to continued legal doubts.
With less than two weeks until the elections and virtually no time for campaigning ahead of them, a postponement would represent a bitter blow to the hopes of the international community of reuniting the deeply divided country.
Foreign powers will also fear that the overall momentum towards democracy could dissipate.
In the short term, they will have to agree on whether or not the interim government continues to fill the political vacuum and prevent civil war.
Несколько правообладаний утверждали действия Libyan Electoral Commission, которая запретила популярные литературы, включая Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, сотрудничество с прежним государством.
The interim prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, and warlord Khalifa Haftar, head of the self-proclaimed Libyan National Army, have been approved by the commission, but subsequently appealed by other parties.
In a statement on Saturday, it said it could not announce the names of the approved candidates from the nearly 100 applicants because it was "keen to exhaust all means of legal action to ensure its decisions comply with issued judgements."
Rival factions accuse each other of intimidating or bribing judicial officials in order to secure their reinstatement of their candidates. The commission is looking to see if the decisions were valid.
In the case of Dbeibah, he had promised as a condition of becoming interim Prime Minister that he would not stand for election, but since then he has argued in court that this was a moral pledge without legal force.
Saif Gaddafi was convicted in absentia in 2015 on charges of war crimes for his part in fighting the revolution that overthrew his father, Muammar Gaddafi.
Он отклоняет, что произошло не так.
The presence of thousands of foreign fighters, mercenaries and indigenous militias makes the country a tinderbox, and there are fears that an election conducted with disputed candidates will only lead to a result that is not recognized.
In a sign of tensions over foreign forces, France is pressing the EU on Monday to agree to impose sanctions on Russian private military contractor Wagner Group, which it says is operating in Libya and the Sahel.
Moscow denies Wagner is linked to the Russian state, and has said it would retaliate against EU sanctions imposed on its citizens.
The ability of the international community to demand that the Libyan political class stick to the 24 December date of the election, which was first agreed in February, has been hindered by the appointment of a UN special envoy, Jan Kubis, who resigned three weeks before the elections after just over a year in the post.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres has since appointed Stephanie Williams, a forceful former UN Deputy Special Envoy, as his Special Adviser.
Russia blocked her appointment as a full ambassador, but she has deep knowledge of Libya and last year showed a willingness to confront those in the political class opposed to the elections.
The UN mission issued a statement urging all parties not to reverse the gains made, pointing out the registration of almost 3 million voters, the successful distribution of voter cards, and applications of large numbers of candidates for the presidency and parliament, as signs of deep popular support for elections.
Richard Norland, the US ambassador to Libya, said, "Refusing to go to the elections and mobilizing to obstruct only puts the fate and future of the country at the mercy of the people inside Libya and their external backers who prefer bullet power to ballot power."

South Africa pays tribute to last apartheid leader De Klerk
South Africa paid an official tribute to FW de Klerk on Sunday, the final president of white rule who freed Nelson Mandela from prison and led the country from apartheid to democracy.
De Klerk perished on November 11 aged 85 after a battle with cancer.
Four days of national mourning have been declared in his honor.
Являлся администратором от 1989 до 1994, императором, императором императором, а также за имперацией, имперацией имперацией, а также за имперацией.
De Klerk also received the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993, after freeing him from prison in 1990.
Mandela became South Africa's first black president after the African National Congress party won the 1994 election.
President Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday morning attended Cape Town's Protestant Groote Kerk, one of South Africa's oldest churches, to deliver a eulogy in De Klerks honor.
De Klerk's widow, Elita Georgiadis, told around 200 attendees that "he was often misunderstood due to his over-correction."
Ich werde diesen Mann nie vergessen, der mich erschüttert hat, der mich dazu gedrängt hat, ihn zu helfen, diese riesige Aufgabe vor ihm zu erfüllen.
Первая математика и national anthem precede ceremony, featuring a portrait of De Klerk between two candles, and a choir decorated with white flowers.
Malgré une bonne réputation à l'étranger, De Klerk a divisé l'opinion en Afrique du Sud et sa mort a provoqué des réactions mitigées.
Critics say he remains inseparable from apartheid-era crimes and could have been held accountable for them if he had lived longer.
De Klerk was a member of the National Party, which, in 1948, officially established apartheid's racial segregation and deprivation of South Africa's non-white majority.
Outside the church a small group of protesters held signs saying "justice denied" and "justice for apartheid victims" and were swiftly led away by police.
Відкриті місця, захищено.
De Klerk's image in his final years was also tarnished amid criticism for his failure to officially apologize for the crimes of apartheid.
In 2020, he denied apartheid was a crime against humanity, before retracting the statement and apologizing.
De Klerk's foundation released a posthumous video apologizing "for the pain, hurt, indignity and damage apartheid has done" to South Africa's non-white populations.

Авалаанс в Washington State Skieresort, кошув 1, взяв 5
Авана леса, которая присутствовала в Washington State, которая позволяет доступа к северном картам, присутствовала, которая присутствовала, присутствовала, присутствула, присутствула, которая присутствула.
Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Darren Moss said the avalanche was reported about 10.50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of the Crystal Mountain, located about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southeast of Seattle.
The identity of the man who died has not been released, but authorities say he was not breathing after being pulled out of the snow and did not survive despite CPR efforts by another skier.
The other skiers in his group saved themselves with the help of two witnesses who saw them getting swept up by the snow.
All of them were wearing avalanche beacons.
Während alle, die in der Avalanche erwischt wurden, Backcountry-Skiers waren, wurde gegen das Skiieren in der Gegend, die knapp in der Grenze des Crystal Mountain Resort liegt, eine Warnung ausgestellt.
The private ski resort determines the conditions, but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there, because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.
Frank DeBerry, President and CEO of the resort, said all six men held uphill travel passes for the ski resort, meaning they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation session on how and where to access backcountry skiing through resort property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursions.
"Skiers могуть навсегда, где-нибудь в государством, зайти.
They had gone out into the forest, but ended up back in bounds (of the resort), where this slide occurred," DeBerry said
In addition to closing the area where the slide occurred, the resort closed the Mt. Rainier Gondola earlier in the day due to winds reaching 100 mph (161 km/h).
The avalanche came amidst the season's first major snowfall.
Area is under winter storm warning until Sunday morning, with National Weather Service saying possible 12 to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow for areas above 2,000 feet (610 meters).
“Сейчас началось всё невероятно.
People got excited," DeBerry said.
Все мы должны помнить, что это математическая игра, которая carries risk.

I'm still with you
Oh, so glad you asked. I have a lot to say about this.
Yes, there has been a pretty drastic change.
I have been overweight/obese since I was three years old, so existing like that is all I knew until the age of 30.
The vast majority of my family and friends, who knew me before, treat me the same and are SO.
Damn.
supportive.
I do have a select few familial relationships that were strained to begin with, where it seems like my weight loss has exacerbated the existing problems.
This could be the result of their complex or mine, because I think they are used to being able to shit on me and I am now even less willing to take their shit.
One person in particular, very weirdly, has tried to take credit for my weight loss.
To put it simply, they implied that they were the driving force that got me here, in the guise of being supportive, when in reality they didn’t even know I was making these changes until I had already lost well over 100lbs.
In fact, they were the last to know, because I just didn’t want them to try and take control and bully me into things I used to let them do.
Naturally, now they’ve taken to insulting my other features, like telling me that my nose and forehead look too big because I lost weight and that I need a nose job and fringe to fix it - this is typical behavior from them.
Сначала, они только моили меня, а когда я не ответил, они публиковали на социальных сетях, без сомнений, об этом.
When I was bigger, that would have destroyed me, and I would have listened, but now I just ignore it.
Дякуюсь, моя температура тем большой (не только тем, что она больше).
The strangest part for me is the attention from strangers.
Ukrainian people really did not pay me any attention when I was bigger.
Как, немного, немного.
Не могу сказать “hello”, або “smile”, когда мы пройдем на улице, а не забыв, что мы ещё ещё.
Definitely not going out of their way to help or compliment me.
It was more isolating than I realized because it's what I was used to.
I knew people could be judgmental of my size – with many doing so openly – but I never realized, until I lost weight, the micro- level of it and just how subtle it can come about.
Not only was I unaware of it, simply because it’s what I was used to, but I also don’t think those who perpetuate it are actively aware they’re doing it.
Я действительно считаю, что субъективная ошибка, которая составлялась и улучшалась от обработки и ограничений огородных людей в мультимедиа, что многие люди не понимают, что они проживают.
Сейчас, каждый, везде, смотрит на меня, слышает меня, и т.д.
Male and female interlocutors engage with me differently, making more efforts to talk to me/get to know me - and that's just platonically.
Romantically, my dating pool has expanded from what were willing to be seen with me to what feels like everyone lol.
Это тяжело.
I assumed that at the very least, the fact that I am morbidly obese, have lost all that weight and now have excess skin would deter some people. Despite the fact that I put my weight loss and excess skin at the forefront (because I don’t want it to be a secret), it has bothered/deterred approximately no one in my experience.
Является, скорее всего, противоположно, и сделает их больше интересованными.
I am shocked.
Я также не могу отказаться от попытки упомянуть, что мужчинам, когда ново обращаются к/существующему женщику, которая снизилась весом: комментарии, например, "Я также очень удовлетворяюсь, что вы снизились весом, вы уже не поняли, скрасивые вы" - это не правильно.
I've heard some variations of this more times than I care to count, and they all thought it was a compliment.
Hey r/Military!
I'm from a country where military duty is mandatory and I'm just wondering how it's like for other countries.
Hello everyone!
I'm from Estonia, where I'm part of the National Defense Force.
Here militia service is mandatory for all men from the ages of 16-29.
You have to complete either 8 or 11 months of training, after which you are sent to the "reserve" unit until you turn 60.

I am just wondering how it is for other countries?

Kiev, Ukraine (AP) - What do you guys think about mandatory military service?
При обучении, когда я в Tapa 2018-2019, ещё есть от UK, US, France, Belgique, Denmark и Canada.
W unfortunately, we did not have much time to socialize and I did not get to ask those guys in person what it is like for them to serve in their country’s military.

I enjoy articles like this, which help untangle the convoluted web of sociopaths with megalomania and the plurality of leaders he decried.
Не знаю, где попало Nixon и Carter, а его голубой герой Reagan никакие нельзя.
Während ich lange bekannte, dass diese Weltanschau komplett BS und tatsächlich ich jede dieser Megalomaniacen von Caesar bis Bonaparte, Nixon, Reagan, Bush und Trump,
I can appreciate the historical significance of Caesar or Napoleon but the quasi-sacred nature of their sanitized histories turned me off of them later on in life.
До текущего момента, я всегда отказываюсь, просматривать историю Polska, так как это только позволит меня, чувствовавшей сомнений моих детей, продолжать.
Повторяюсь в этом теме, люблю маленькие детаILS, которые запомнили меня, что на самом деле есть одна корректная выбора (в том числе ещё маленькие ошибки - а в большинстве случаев правильно сделавшееся) и одна сторона, которая не корректна, не правильно сделавшееся, и где сердце, а также сердце, более вероятно принцип, чем глупость.

Years ago, I worked at a cabinet shop.
Переключился на место, где находится загрузочный транспорт, и когда мы внеслись, загрузочный транспорт, загрузочный транспорт загружался.
No reason in particular, there was just space there, that's where he left it.
The next morning I came into work and Jerry (not his real name) came up to me looking pissed about something.
Nothing new, he was always sort of grumpy old man.
Conversation went something similar to below (18 years ago).
Jerry: Did you park that truck there by the dumpster?
Me: No, the owner drove yesterday.
Jerry: Ви нельзя загрузить транспортер туда, тогда меня нельзя загрузить!
Я: Ще не парковал, а собственный.
Jerry: Neznanie, chyba ich, znakišenie toka na toku.
You know, we need to have access to the dumpster.
Me: but I didn’t park it there.
Why don’t you talk to the owner about it?
Jerry: blah blah blah your fault, damn kids no respect, blah blah blah
Me: Nami nie.
Conversation continued in that manner for several minutes, with him scolding me for leaving the trailer in the way that I did not leave in the way.
From that day forward, until I left the cabinet shop a couple of years later, every time I worked late (which was more often than not), and the 5x8 trailer was at the shop, I’d pick up the tongue and roll it up to the dumpster for Jerry to find the next morning.

Family pays tribute to "energetic" 18-year-old stabbed to death in Birmingham
The family of a teenager stabbed to death in Birmingham described him as a "young, energetic 18-year-old" who dreamed of being a digital marketing specialist.
Yahya Sharif was found seriously injured on Friday afternoon in Coventry Road, Small Heath, West Midlands Police said.
Федеральная Социальная Организация Федеральной Социальной Организации Федеральной Социальных Организаций Федеральных Социальных Органов Федеральных Социальных органов Федеральных социальных органов
Malgré les efforts des paramédics, Yahya, de Nechells, a été confirmé mort sur les lieux.
Post-mortem showed that he died from a stab wound to the chest.
In a statement released on his behalf, his family said: "We cannot believe that Yahya has disappeared from our eyes.
Я тоже не понимаю, почему они его убили.
Young, energetic 18-year-old, his dream was to be a digital marketing specialist.
The whole community is shocked.
May God be with the family he left behind, especially with his parents."
Detektivів загружають CCTV і другие документы, когда они пытаются понять, что произошло, а также идентифицировать и атакующиеся.
Detective inspector Hannah Whitehouse, from the homicide unit, said: "Yahia was just 18 and with his life ahead of him.
This has now been taken away in the most tragic circumstances.
There is no clear motive for the attack and we're working round the clock to identify and trace who was responsible for it.
Witnesses много, а всегда нужна помощь.
I would appeal to those who were there at that time to do the right thing, come and talk to us and tell us exactly what happened and why.
It's the least Yahya's family deserve."

Alamo location in California pulled a similar scam on me.
При отправке моей карты, нашелся внутри моей карты (которая мне не создана).
Had to sign to acknowledge the "damage".
I also had videos and photos which did not cover the bottom of the car.
Несколько недель тому, когда я снова в дом, отправлялась меня почта, содержащая список других угрождений, которые являются следующим образом: угрождение карты, следовательно, невозможно, непосредственно перерисовка карты.
None of that damage was visible to me (or the representative when I returned the vehicle).
None of this was visible on the photos I took when I returned the vehicle, so I disputed the claim.
They denied the dispute, and demanded immediate payment for the damage.
Потому, что работу, передал собой фотографии.
Shortly after that, I received a letter from Alamo saying that they would waive the charges in the interest of customer satisfaction.

Decoupling требует, чтобы они убеждались, что их приложение работает на всех разных iOS-версиях.
This is not even necessarily true.
Just put a cap on the versions of iOS supported by the app and only push out updates for devices with the most recent compatible versions of iOS.
That's how most apps work now.
> In addition, since Apple can release new iOS and macOS versions often.

纵使苹果公司将 OS 更新率提至可为少数应用中的小bugs 进行修复，为什么用户每次都要进行“全盘 OS 升级”？

This is in contrast to Google.
Google had to delink because there were a lot of versions of Android in the wild, each with a huge market share.
I can say without a doubt that if Android versions on smartphones were consistent like iOS, Google would never have made the releases with OS releases for these apps.

Gabba double power failure explained and why it could happen again
Risk of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound setup are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
SOURCES TOLD THE AGE AND THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD THAT THE GABBA IS THE ONLY MAJOR STADIUM IN AUSTRALIAN CRICKET WHERE THE MAIN POWER SUPPLY AT THE GROUND IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO FIRE UP THE VAST ARRAY OF BROADCAST TRUCKS AND DEVICES NEEDED TO BEAM PICTURES AROUND THE WORLD.
Первичные и активные генераторы, загружающие глобальную просмотрку Gabba Test, стало 25 минут на четверг.
Потому, что необходимо, чтобы базовый уровень в районе подготовлялся, чтобы подготовился, чтобы подготовить светные волны Габа - из них, одна из которых, сказалось, упалась в 2019 году в Big Bash League.
As a result, broadcasters are drawing their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power to be derived from a back-up generator.
Notably, on the fourth day of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator, fused with the back-up generator, caused both to go down simultaneously, resulting in the total or partial loss of the broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes.
NEP, the company that provides outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, have sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators.
All other grounds used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, MCG, SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up.
This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for Fox Cricket host broadcaster in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff who were unable to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls kept in the air throughout the match.
Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that it would be safer to play the match elsewhere on a technical basis but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in allowing a skeleton crew into Queensland.
I will send you a transcript of our conversation.
Should you have any further questions or concerns, please reply back to the email and we will be able to assist you further.

My neighbors got a dog about three years ago.
These neighbors and I share a fence.

I've tried to ignore it, talk softly, etc.
Этот дога достаточно страшен.

Поэтому, я отправился и сделал собственный действие, и запрашивая, чтоб они могли мне помочь, понять, как сделать, чтоб этот догой chill.
I can't even use my yard at this point.
Этот дога держится вкладками всю день, глядя и поглядя.
I have asked if I can give it healthy treats through the fence.
Owner says no.
I asked if we could go in halves on a non-shock bark collar.
Owner says no.
(Edit to say I asked the neighbor to help her dog at least three times.)
Фрустовано, а не хочу, что-нибудь обьяснить, я создал план.
I bought a very nice portable speaker that is loud.
Как, я сохранил и внесил в эту.

Liz Truss добавляет ещё 75 миллионов в подготовка к Afghanistan
Liz Truss has announced that the UK will give an additional £75 million in aid to Afghanistan to help address its worsening humanitarian situation.
The Foreign Secretary said the commitment would help save lives and "support stability in the region."
После обсуждений G7-го федераций в Liverpool, на sabbatу, о том, что в阿富汗 согласованное действие следует принять, а также, как согласованно с Taliban-ом работать.
The militant group stormed Kabul in August in a lightning advance, as 20 years of occupation of the Central Asian country came to a close with a hurried allied withdrawal.
Ms Truss said: "The UK is providing vital humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan this winter.
The funds that were announced today will save lives, protect women and girls, and support stability in the region.
Wojcięte się na zewnętrznymi zagrodzień w Afghanistan."
The additional financial support will bring the UK’s commitment to Afghanistan to £286 million this year.
This will be used to provide support for victims of gender-based violence and to fund essential child protection services.
United Nations and aid agencies will prioritise those most at risk, including households headed by women and disabled people, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said (FCDO).
Officials said no funding would go directly through the Taliban but instead would be funnelled through the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, the World Food Programme (WFP) and other organisations.
WFP will receive £34 million of funding announced on Sunday.
David Beasley, the executive director of the organization, said that the donation would "help us save many lives."
Як мы видим на земле, это сердцевое - 23 миллионов людей столкнутся с тяжелыми угрозями в стране, которая затрудненна загрязнением, конфликтом и экономически.
"Women and children bear the brunt of this suffering, and as the harsh winter descends, more and more are falling into malnutrition and starvation each day."
This week, the UN humanitarian chief warned that Afghanistan's economic collapse was "happening before our eyes," and urged the international community to take action to stop "the freefall" before it leads to more deaths.
Martin Griffiths said: "By the week, it's getting worse and worse."
The funding announcement follows ministers this week facing awkward questions about the Afghan withdrawal effort after a whistleblower's evidence to MPs.
Raphael Marshall, who was employed by the Foreign Office during Operation Pitting, claimed just 5% of Afghan nationals who applied to flee under one UK scheme were helped as a result of the "dysfunctional" and "chaotic" handling of the situation.
Marshall told the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons that some of those hoping to escape had been murdered after being left behind in Kabul.
He also claimed that Boris Johnson requested that "considerable capacity" be made available to evacuate animals from a shelter run by ex-Royal Marine Paul "pen" Farthing, putting the lives of troops at risk in order to help evacuate them on a privately funded plane.
Prime Minister has called the claims "complete nonsense."
On Sunday at the Museum of Liverpool, Ms Truss will have discussions with foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, who are attending the G7 gathering for the first time - most of them virtually.
The Foreign Secretary will stress the importance of working with South-East Asia's "future economies" to tackle the current challenges facing the West, FCDO said.
The invitation to Asian ministers comes after the UK’s integrated review on foreign policy announced in March a “tilt” towards the Indo-Pacific, in a move seen as aiming to counter China’s growing influence in the region.

I was buying new tires.
I've found the ones I wanted on a tire store website.
I printed the page and took it to my local shop.

The guy at the shop checked things out and it turned out that the current price of the tires was higher than my printout.
Не знаю, откуда более высокая цена.
幸亏，这名男子诚实可靠，他并没有试图抬高价格，而是以我打印的价格出售了轮胎。

Most boards are mass market boards such as Sector 9s or Loaded Tan Tien’s … I have both and I’m not hating.
If I want something out of the ordinary, I buy it directly from the manufacturer or through Muir.
Подгрузка всегда является проблемой, а загрузка всегда составляет опыт.
I really wanted the Tortuga, but when all was said and done, it was over AU$500 (including shipping and exchange rate).
Составлялся только доставка.
I understand this is not something you have control over... I only wanted to illustrate the considerations and trade-offs made from this side of the world.
Love your boards!
Much respect.
This is the thing people don't get.
Mathematics doesn't say you can't get really sick if you're young and healthy.
Maybe I'm a pessimist, but that's better than thinking you're invincible.

I think I took it seriously because I've been sick a lot, and I hate it.
I'm generally healthy, but the flu always hits me very hard.
I was afraid that Covid was going to be worse.
No, probably because I didn't get exposed to a lot of the virus. But it was bad enough.
My body still took months to return to normal.

Russia warn of 'consequences' if Ukraine attacks
The G7 has warned Russia of massive consequences and severe costs if President Vladmir Putin attacks Ukraine, according to a draft statement.
United States intelligence agencies assess that Russia could be planning a multi-front offensive on Ukraine as early as next year, involving as many as 175,000 troops.
The Kremlin denies it plans to invade, saying the West is gripped by Russophobia.
Moscow says NATO's expansion threatens Russia and has contravened assurances given to it when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
G7 delegats, at a meeting in the northern English city Liverpool, said they were united in their condemnation of Russia’s military build-up near Ukraine and called on Moscow to de-escalate.
The draft statement, confirmed by G7 sources, said: "Russia should be sure that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and serious cost."
Як правило, мы утверждаем, что у нас единственный цель - утверждение, что Украина имеет право на единственный страх.
For Moscow, the growing embrace of NATO of a neighbouring ex-Soviet republic - and what it sees as the nightmare possibility of Alliance missiles in Ukraine aimed against Russia - is a "red line" that it will not allow to be crossed.
Mr. Putin has demanded legally binding security guarantees that NATO will not further expand eastward or place its weapons close to Russian territory; Washington has said repeatedly that no country can veto Ukraine's NATO hopes.
Россия, 2014, привязалось Кримское пенсиону Украина, что позволяло Востоку принять сотрудничества с Россией.
The Kremlin said today that Mr Putin had told US President Joe Biden that Russian troops posed no threat, and that Moscow was being demonised for moving its troops around its own territory.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that there were significant conceptual differences between Russia and the United States regarding Moscow's "red lines."
The G7 includes Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada, and the United States, along with a representative from the European Union.
The G-7 said in the draft that it calls on Russia to de-escalate, pursue diplomatic channels, and abide by its international commitments on transparency in military activities.
Як правило, мы подтверждаем усилия Франции и Германии в Normandy Format, чтобы полностью выполнить Мinsk Agreements, чтобы решить восточный Украина.
China's Xi and Russia's Putin dominate the G7
Papa calls for ‘serious international dialogue’ to defuse Ukraine tensions
Papa Francis, in his first comments on tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine, called for serious international dialogue to resolve tensions today and urged both sides to avoid an armed conflict.
He said he was praying "for dear Ukraine, for all its churches and religious communities, and for all of its people, that tensions there are resolved through a serious international dialogue, not with weapons."
Weapons are not the path to take.
May this Christmas bring peace to Ukraine," the Pope told thousands of people in St. Peter's Square for his noon blessing and address.
Ukrainian population is predominantly Orthodox Christian, with Catholics of either Latin or Byzantine rite making up about 10% of the population in the former Soviet republic.
Separately, Mr Biden said he told Mr Putin that Russia would pay "a terrible price" and face devastating economic consequences, if it invaded Ukraine.

Scholz, polish prime minister discuss migration, energy, EU
Germany's new Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, came to Warsaw on Sunday for talks with Polish Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, about migration, energy, European Union issues and tensions east of the bloc's border.
Morawiecki l'accueillit avec des honneurs militaires devant le bureau du Premier ministre polonais.
It was one of Scholz’s early visits after he was sworn in with his coalition cabinet on Wednesday.
Poland, a vocal opponent of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will carry Russian gas directly to Germany, says it makes Europe dependent on Russia's deliveries and exposes it to pressure from Moscow.
Jerman's regulator has suspended the approval procedure for the completed pipeline due to legal issues.
Warszawa's government is also involved in an intensifying dispute with the EU executive arm, the European Commission, which is withholding pandemic recovery funds from Poland, saying the government's policies erode judicial independence there.
Scholz and Morawiecki shall also discuss complex bilateral relations under Germany's new government.
Добрый государственный здоровье ограничено, чем мировой второй мировой второй мировой годы, в том числе, когда польская традиционная партия, которая указывает, что Германия планирует оплата попавшихся снижено.
Agnieszka Lada- Konefal, Deputy Director of the German Institute for Polish Affairs in Darmstadt, expects Scholz's government to continue dialogue and contacts with Poland, which is an important member on the EU's eastern flank and Germany's fifth-largest trading partner.
The visit coincides with the 30th anniversary of the two parliaments ratifying a treaty on good neighborly relations and friendly cooperation.
Deutschlands neue Außenministerin, Annalena Baerbock, war am Freitag in Warszawa.
She voiced Germany's support for Poland, which has sealed its eastern border to migrants who are apparently encouraged by the Belarusian government to seek illegal passage.
She also called for humanitarian treatment of migrants stuck at the border.
Poland and the EU say Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko's government is seeking to destabilize the bloc by encouraging migration to its countries.
On Friday, Scholz met in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron and later with EU and NATO officials in Brussels.
Scholz, a center-left politician, became Germany's ninth post-World War II Chancellor, opening a new era for the EU’s most populous nation and largest economy after Angela Merkel’s 16-year tenure.
Government of his center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats.
Enterprise-D Shuttlebays
Enterprise-D of The Next Generation had three shuttlebays.
On the show, we always see Shuttlebays on decks 12 and 13.
Эти две shuttlecraft модели были представлены на формальном уровне, а также на формальном уровне.
Я всегда любовало, когда альбомы менялись на двойные shuttlecraft в правом углу.
Weshalb wir es nie in den Augen sahen?
It was located under the main bridge on decks 3&4 and was presumably a massive facility.
Смотрев в сторону, нашелось, что достаточно прямо перед собой, чтобы нашелось достаточно прямой перед собой.
In the original *Star Trek*, miniature sets were built and used with miniature shuttles to give the shuttlebay life.
Феноменты, когда-нибудь, были обнаружены, где-нибудь, где-то, где-то, где-нибудь, когда-нибудь, обнаружены, где-то, где-то, когда-нибудь, где-нибудь, обнаружились, где-нибудь, геометрически, геометрически, когда-нибудь, геометрии, геометрии, когда-нибудь.
Не могли они это сделать на TNG?
Worf and Data launched a shuttle from the main shuttlebay in "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II", but the shuttle launch was seen from inside the shuttle.
Я просто вижу границу внешнего окна, заменяющейся за нее пространство.
The only time we saw the shuttle bay in full scale was in "Cause and Effect."
We see a space shot of the roll doors opening, decompressing the main shuttle bay, and we get a quick glimpse of the inside along with a few parked shuttles.

Of course, they don’t.

How was the farewell to Etho?
First of a quick disclaimer: I am not the account user but her wife.
I have permission to use this account because I suck at tech and it helps me with mental health issues.
The second and far more important disclaimer: I do not want to stir drama nor suspect something was not right.
Является ли это только переключением вода?
I'm just an old fan satisfying a nostalgia streak.
With that out of the way...
I used to be a massive Mindcrack fan back in the day.
Never missed a release from Guude, loved the collabs, etc.
While watching a random YouTube feed, I came across a video detailing Etho's channel history.
Near the end, it touched on Mindcrack going commercial.
How he did not see it in a positive light and the inevitable refusal to sign the relevant contracts.
Encore, neither going 'pro', nor wanting to keep it casual is a wrong decision, and I know people go in different directions and such.
Quick Google led me to this old thread, which shows his side of things.
Значительно много, что необязательно сказать, а что на первый взгляд пришло в голову, это, что вы смотрели в другой стороны, а в целом ок.
Это всё, что произошло, произошло после, когда я перешел на другое, поэтому это все новое для меня.
What I am after is the other side of the picture.
As I said, my mental health is not stellar, and seeing an old group I was attached to, as a fan, parting ways without some dumb explosions, which are all too common in the polarized public discourse, could be kinda nice and stuff.
So, was the response from 'the old gang'?
Did you keep doing stuff together?
Did you drift apart slowly?
Are you still chatting or inviting each other to events?
Ich glaube nicht, dass ich etwas dramatischeres erwarten werde oder, dass ich Menschen bei jedem anderen Throat sehen werde.
The opposite.
I guess in a way, a form of low-key closure of something kinda small in my life to reflect some positivity on my own mentally troubled butt.

Before 2018.
Я столкнулся с US Air вPhiladelphia, а не снова снова снова снова на Newark, а меня и десять других людей пытались получить домашние товары.
The counter people were the worst I have ever seen.
После того, как они вышли за границу, они остановились, и рассказывались о нерабочих внедрениях.
I had a confirmed reservation.
После того, как мы ждали, я сказал ей, что я зарезервировал, и она увеличивала меня, что я ей сказал, что я сказал.
I finally gave up and walked over to Hertz. They charged me a fortune but they got me a car right away.
I swore to never use Avis again.
Worst car experience ever.
National and Hertz have always been good experiences for me.
Those two, Enterprise.
Enterprise was not really bad in any way, but they were never as convenient as National, where I could walk up and pick out a car, and drive away without waiting forever at a counter.
Ich wisse, dass es anekdotische Erfahrungen sind, aber ich werde meinen Weg herauszufinden, um jede Person, um Avis wie die Plague zu vermeiden.
Я точно правда, что хорошо услуг-сервис позволяет клиентам охватывающей, а не удовлетворяющей, услуги.
French fishermen threaten to disrupt British imports in post-Brexit fishing row
French fishermen have threatened to disrupt British imports as tensions escalate between France and the UK over post-Brexit fishing rights.
The threat was made on Saturday, a few hours after Britain agreed to issue another 23 licences to French fishermen to alleviate tensions between the two neighbors, who have been at loggerheads over the fishing dispute for the past six months.
France is seeking 81 more approvals to reach 104 licenses it needs for its boats to operate in British and Channel Islands waters under the Brexit agreement signed last year.
European Union had specified a December 10 deadline for London to grant licences to French fishing boats under Brexit. Paris threatened European legal action in case of no breakthrough.
The group, representing fishermen in the key port of Boulogne-sur-mer and others along the northern coast, threatened late on Saturday to launch protests, underlining that France is entitled to around 80 more UK licenses.
CRPMEM, a local fishing industry group for the Hauts-de-France region, said in a statement: "Protests should be expected... protests that will target British imports."
The group said its members were "exasperated" by the news of only 23 new licences and felt "betrayed" by the European Commission, which could launch legal action against the UK over the issue.
The CRPMEM said the protests would be "in line with the blockade of ports in Brittany, Normandy and the North of France which took place on November 26."
French fishing boats briefly blocked ferries and other boats in Calais, Saint-Malo and Ouistreham ports that day, while vehicles were sent to disrupt traffic seeking to use the Channel Tunnel railway link.
Since then, several rounds of talks between the two sides have been held, but a durable solution has yet to be worked out.

Time is running out for Iran nuclear deal, Germany says
Foreign Affairs Minister of Germany, Heiko Maas, warned on Saturday that the time was running out to find a way to revive a nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, after meetings with her counterparts from G7 countries.
Повторяющиеся обсуждения в Вьетнам, пытающиеся внедрить новый согласен, снижены, поскольку оба сторонам пытаются оценить схожие понятия после текущих переменных.
„Time is running out“, sagte die deutsche Außenministerin Annalena Baerbock zu Reportern in Liverpool, England, wo sich die G7-Außenminister sind.
In den vergangenen Tagen ist es gezeigt worden, dass wir keinen Fortschritt haben.
Baerbock said Iran resumed talks with a position that put the negotiations back six months.
The current round of talks in Vienna follows a five-month pause after the election of a hardline anti-Westerner as Iran's President, Ebrahim Raisi.
Earlier, US officials said Secretary of State Antony Blinken had held a “productive” meeting with counterparts from Britain, Germany and France on Friday discussing the way forward for the Iran talks.
One senior State Department official said there was an "intense" conversation among the G-7 countries, which were united in their position on nuclear talks.
"The statement will also emphasize the importance of getting Iran back to the table and that it's possible to conclude a deal, but that the time is shrinking, so we're united in that," the official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said.
The official added that Robert Malley, U.S. Special Envoy for Iran, was heading back to Vienna for talks.
Iranian officials have previously said that they were sticking to their tough stance.
Under the original nuclear deal, abandoned by then-President Donald Trump in 2018, Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from US, European Union and UN sanctions.
The West fears that the program will be used to develop weapons, something Tehran denies.
Raisi on Saturday said that Tehran was serious in its nuclear talks in Vienna, IRNA news agency reported.
The indirect talks between the United States and Iran, in which diplomats from France, Great Britain, Germany, Russia and China shuttle between them, because Tehran refuses direct contact with Washington, are aimed at getting both sides to resume full compliance with the accord.
The G7 meeting, which is expected to lead to a joint call for Iran to moderate its nuclear program and seize the opportunity of the Vienna talks.

Aston Villa, latest Premier League club to suffer Covid outbreak
Астон Villa становились последним Premier League клубом, к которому пришел Covid-серо.
The training session at Bodymoor Heath on Sunday was cancelled as a result, a session designed just for the recovery of a small number of players after the loss to Liverpool on Saturday.
This is not thought to be a serious outbreak at this stage with The Athletic reporting that just one player has tested positive with the rest being staff at the training ground.
Villa faces an away game at Norwich City in the Premier League on Tuesday night and there is no suggestion it will be cancelled, with training also expected to continue as normal on Monday.
The identity of the player that tested positive has not been confirmed, nor whether it was one of the men who were involved against Liverpool.
Manchester United also suffered a Covid outbreak on Sunday and there is more concern about that situation, with the Red Devils' trip to Brentford on Tuesday now reportedly under threat.
Tottenham Hotspur, who have already been struggling with the virus, have postponed their match against Brighton after eight players and five members of staff tested positive.
Championship side West Brom and Queens Park Rangers have also suffered outbreaks, with QPR's clash with Sheffield United on Monday postponed.

Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at Crowdstrike, a cybersecurity firm, said: "The internet is on fire right now."
"People are scrambling to patch it," he said, "and all kinds of people are scrambling to exploit it."
On Friday morning, he said, in the 12 hours since the bug's existence was disclosed, it had been "fully weaponised," meaning perpetrators had developed and distributed tools to exploit it.
The vulnerability may be the worst computer vulnerability discovered in years.
The vulnerability was discovered in a utility that is ubiquitous in cloud servers and enterprise software used across industries and governments.
Unless it is fixed, it grants criminals, spies, and programming novices alike easy access to internal networks, where they can loot valuable data, plant malware, erase critical information, and much more.
Cyber attacks are now considered the biggest threat to financial stability.
Joe Sullivan, Chief Security Officer for Cloudflare, who protects websites from malicious actors, said, "I'd be hard-pressed to think of a company that's not at risk."
Неизвестные миллионов серверов его установлены, а специалисты сказали, что некоторое время нельзя было определить, когда она срабатывала.
Amit Yoran, CEO of cybersecurity firm Tenable, called it "the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade" — and possibly the biggest in the history of modern computing.
The vulnerability, dubbed "Log4Shell" was rated 10 on a scale of one to 10 by the Apache Software Foundation, which oversees development of software.
Anyone with the exploit can obtain full access to a computer that uses the software.
Experts said the extreme ease with which a vulnerability lets an attacker access a web server – no password required – is what makes it so dangerous.
New Zealand’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) was among the first to report that the flaw was being “actively exploited in the wild” just hours after it was publicly reported Thursday and a patch was released.
The vulnerability was reported to the foundation by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba on November 24, it said.

Missed Out on Shiba Inu?
EverGrow Might Be The Next Big Crypto to Explode in 2022
Shiba Inu is the latest meme crypto to go viral and despite being down almost 60% from its all-time high, the market cap still stands at an eye-watering $20 billion, making it the 12th biggest crypto in the world by valuation.
$100 investment at launch would be worth over $2 million today!
Несмотря на том, что множество людей, скорее всего, затруднились ограниченными условиями, чтобы не пропустить такой улучшение, реальность сказуемо, что продукция на Shiba Inu - это прямая погода.
Shiba's race was a combination of some very smart marketing and a lot of hype, which led to a flood of investors with FOMO (fear of missing out) rushing into the meme coin.
Even the name, which was a homage to Elon Musk-backed Dogecoin, was all part of the design.
In reality, Shiba Inu provides no tangible utility or value, with little effort required to do so in the future.
Несмотря на наличие Ethereum- blockchain, если сотрудники Shiba Inu сталкивались с условиями, чтобы продолжить разработку, они были очень позиционированны.
Notably, there are several cryptocurrencies working to rise above the pack and back their popularity with real utility and fundamental value.
Hace 10 semanas, EverGrow Coin ($EGC) fue lanzado por un equipo de expertos en finanzas, blockchain y marketing.
One groundbreaking element of their project is the fact that the token pays a stable currency to holders.
Since launch, holders of EverGrow Coin have received over $30 million of Binance pegged USD rewards - a stable, regulated currency pegged 1:1 with the USD.
The project has 110,000 holders according to BSCScan.
With their revolutionary contract, EverGrow Coin grew rapidly to over $1 billion in market cap, but then a major data error on CoinMarketCap just weeks into the launch caused mass panic amongst investors.
Such a new project can take time to build trust, and that panic was exploited by a series of articles purportedly paid for by rivals of the project, using incorrect data to try and draw EverGrow investors away from the project.
По следующему месяцу ошибки продолжались, а EverGrow уменьшалось до 300 млн.
Yesterday, CoinMarketCap placed an alert on EverGrow’s page, confirming that the data error was fixed.
The price has now stabilized, and signs of returning confidence saw an increase of 22% from the recent lows.
Nevertheless, EverGrow remains well below the highs achieved before this error.
EverGrow is very different from Shiba Inu.
In addition to obvious benefits of USD rewards, the team behind the project has already launched a SWAP dApp on their website, recently revealed the upcoming release of a Crypto Wallet and promised to surpass features offered by Trust Wallet or Safemoon.
Is EverGrow Coin the Next Shiba Inu?
With Shiba Inu offering little to no utility, priced at around 66 times that of EverGrow Coin there is a clear argument for an innovative and ground breaking project like EverGrow to see some serious upside out of their current low market cap.
If the team can continue to impress the crypto community with their innovation and transparency, and can shake off the fear spread among investors by CoinMarketCap errors, there is a good chance that EverGrow Coin could be one of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in for 2022.
There is a circularity to it...

Wages didn't really go up, but shit got cheaper.
The problem is that we have sold out the people below us.
I agree with you.
Some of us need to give up at least some convenience in order to make society better.
Even if I'm not at the income level that would pay more taxes, I still buy fewer things that are more expensive, so that they can be made by people earning a living wage, and I can be willing to wait a few days for it so that some gig worker doesn't have to be worked to the bone...

Molecular Diagnosis Test May Detect Omicron Variant In 20 Minutes: Report
Korean researchers have developed a molecular diagnostics technology that can detect Omicron variants.
Technology development has been completed and it is expected to take time for commercialization.
POSTECH on the 10th announced that a team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Chemical Engineering Department has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect Omicron variant in just 20-30 minutes and will publish the results online.
Omicron - модель, в которой 26-32 изменений в spike, которая позволяет COVID-19-virus, чувствуя клетки.
Як правило, технологія молекулярного проверка позволяє отличити мультинucleotide, а також " Stealth Omicron ", за якою PCR-тексты невозможно проверити.
At the moment, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are using three methods to detect COVID-19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as the spike protein) analysis, and PCR test.
In the case of Delta variant, it can be detected by current PCR test, but Omicron cannot.
This time the newly developed technology is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences but the molecular diagnostic technology.
The existing technology can only screen specific areas of the virus, but the molecular diagnostic technology is designed to cause nucleic acid-binding reactions only when the COVID-19 RNA exists, enabling rapid detection.
According to Professor Lee, Omicron has strong signal for N genes in PCR tests but has weak signal for S genes.
In the case of “Stealth Omicron”, both N and S genes confirmed positive, which made it difficult to distinguish from other variants.
The molecular diagnostic technology works in different mechanisms from PCR, efficiently detecting the Omicron variant.
Unlike conventional technology, which processes up to 96 samples per device on average, the new technology can process more than 125 samples in 30 minutes (more than 250 samples per hour).
In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, so it can make diagnostic kits simply and easily.
Потому, что метод могет 4 дней составить прогнозированный код, очень реагирует он, даже если в будущем новая версия, алиас, алиаса, алиаса, алиаса.
I hope the disclosure of this technology will help us as soon as possible return to normal daily life," said Professor Lee.
Wir werden versuchen, schnell zu diagnostizieren und zu reagieren auf neue Varianten, die nach COVID- 19 kommen könnten.
This technology is currently before commercialization.
Однако, она могла применяться в текущих состояниях, когда PCR-тест для Omicron ещё не разработан.
Lee教授说：“我认为，在明年下半年，这项技术将接近商业化。”
The reason for me to disclose the technology is to share it with others so that they can develop better technologies to overcome COVID-19 and allow underdeveloped countries to also analyze COVID-19 variants."
I told ya so...
The supermarket where I worked was undergoing a complete and total reorganization.
Стенки менялись, а мы все смотрили, где всё находится.
Of course, it was chaos.
Naquela época, estávamos bastante ocupados, e eu tinha uma fila de clientes, mas Karen decide pular a fila para perguntar a mim onde algo estava.
I don't remember the exact item but it was something like paper plates (or something close to them...plastic forks?)
?
Since I had a line of customers, I couldn't leave to help her locate, so I told her "I believe they are now on aisle 7."
Before I can even get on my walkie and ask someone for sure, she storms off.
После того, чтоб меня сказали, что они ещё не присутствуют.
Now there is a manager nearby so I ask him if he can help her and I tell him that I thought they were on 7 but she said they were not.
Я смотрю, чего-то не понял, и говорю: "OK, могу-тоже, 8.
I'll help you find them, ma'am."
Потому, когда они начнут двигаться, обращаясь к меня, она сказал: "Вы должны понимать, что нельзя сказать кто-нибудь, где что-то находится, если вы еще не поняли".
Long story short, she comes back to the checkout but goes to another line.
Когда менеджер снова войдет, стремится он к меня и сыграет: "Я тебе сказал, они остановились на стадии 7."
HA... ты меня сказала!

Water heater temp and bath issue.
My water heater is set pretty low.
It's a small tank in a closet (I'm living in an old pre-war apartment).
The question is, does it fill the bathtub all the way without going cold?
If I only take a bath once a week (but shower every 2 days or so), and the heater has enough water for quick showers, would it be worth turning up the heat for the once-a-week bath?
Or would I save more electricity heating up my stockpot on the stove and adding it to the bath when the water heater is emptied?
Editor: Thanks everyone for the advice!
Я увеличил температуру только некольким, а это заработало.
The comment about boiling being inefficient is probably correct, because even though the water heater is running continuously, it has SO MUCH insulation.
It's hard to get to, so I'm leaving it at that temperature and calling it a day.

I get what Dave's point was.
To kill black people is worse than to make fun of trans people.
Naturally.
But Dave forgot something.
Many people who hate trans people also hate black people.
He hasn't endeared anyone to #blacklivesmatter.
He's just given transphobes another hero and more anti-trans rhetoric.

Thief's pants fall down as he attempts to flee.
To note, I did not witness this.
I am told this by colleagues at my first retail job.
These two guys came to the store.
One of them was pretty infamous in the town for always being in trouble with the law.
After browsing for a while, the infamous one left and returned to his vehicle while the other one took a shopping cart and put a large 500 dollar socket set in it.
После чего, когда администраторы, находящиеся в сторону выхода, занимались в работе, протягался сотрудник и вышел.
Каждый из них заметил, и вопросили друг другу, если человек оплатил.
When it was confirmed that he did not, one ran after him.
I was told that the cashier shouted for him to stop while she chased after him, but he started running with the cart to the getaway vehicle.
Не могу понять, являлся ли он одним из чего-то, кто-нибудь, кто любил порядка порядка.
На мой взгляд, сказалось, что его квадраты появлялись, и он пытался их сверху сдвигать, а вместо того, чтоб двигать, пытался сдвигать карт.
Then he dumped the cart, leaving the socket in it as he pulled his pants up and ran to the getaway vehicle, jumping into it with his infamous accomplice diving them off.
I'm in HR and have worked payroll in the past.
If someone comes to me and tells me that they are working to get out of a financially abusive relationship, and their abuser looks at their paystubs,

Depending on the company.
I haven't had to do any of the above but I've had to keep staff off our directory and teach reception to pretend they didn't know who someone was and how to identify the abuser, if he came by.
I could make an arrangement to siphon money as an after-tax deduction, give the deduction a misleading name that makes it look like some sort of mandatory deduction, and then remit that deduction back to you separately.
Я скорее всего необходимо, что вы согласились.
Another thing I might be able to do is have a fake email conversation with you about why your pay stubs are going missing or why your password isn't working (after you change it) and how we're "working on figuring this out, thank you for your patience!"

The best way to lose a new young worker is by shocking them with that.
Потому, что мой друг, когда я с Pizza Hut работал некоторое количество лет (не действительно, до месяцев, когда я начал работу и обучался), сделал, что-то подобное.
They proceeded to put him on two close in a row.
Он отказался.
Unless you advertise a job as a "closing gig" late at night, expect to lose your workers if you strike them too early.

Борис Жоансон на край фavour с Tory MP
Персонально, Борис Жуанненко (Boris Johnson) является сомненным.
And some Tory MPs hope he will continue that streak by managing to rescue himself from plumming poll ratings after a string of Downing Street parties in violation of Covid laws.
Prime Minister had tangled himself in knots by repeatedly denying that any rules were broken, before more reports and evidence emerged to suggest the opposite.
First there was the video of aides to No 10 laughing while they discussed a Christmas gathering on December 18 last year.
Then Dominic Cummings, once Johnson's closest advisor, promised pictures had been taken of parties, and so, with bated breath, critics of the government waited for them to surface.
When an image was published on Sunday showing Johnson hosting a Christmas quiz for staff tuning in from No 10 and at home, it wasn't quite the smoking gun some thought would finally skewer him.
The Sunday Mirror image shows Johnson with two aides dressed up with tinsel and a Santa hat, not socially distanced from one another and clearly engaged in a social occasion while mixing households.
But it could have been worse.
Media outlets including the Guardian, Mirror, BBC and Times have been told of other parties hosted in No 10 and Conservative party headquarters where people drank copiously, played party games, exchanged secret Santa gifts, and socialised into the small hours.
Ministers will quietly breathe a sigh of relief - no pictures of these scenes have been leaked yet.
While Johnson's attendance at the quiz broke rules, according to Keir Starmer, Labour leader and a former public prosecutor, Tory MPs think people will look at photo and judge it really shows him hosting virtual quiz - familiar sight during pandemic.
The staff, dialing in from other rooms in No 10 while drinking and not social distancing, cannot be seen.
On Sunday, Nadhim Zahawi insisted that the picture was just an example of Johnson "thanking his staff" and used it to downplay the party scandal as "hype."
He told LBC: "Your listeners will look at that front page and see a PM in his office, with two close people who work with him, no alcohol, taking 10 to 15 minutes thanking and motivating his staff, who have been coming in because they can't work from home."
Великое угроза уже произошло, а мутинные члены пытались, чтоб министер позволял, чтоб сценарий "одна правила для их" становился в порядке, от Cummings до Matt Hancock и, более_recently, Owen Paterson.
Johnson тяжело с тобой, и если появляются дополнительные фотографии, они могут его с тяжелыми сторонами перевести.

Lonely queues for Banksy's shirts supporting statue-toppling protesters
Культуральная музыка.
They were released in support of protesters on trial for toppling a statue of a slave trader during a Black Lives Matter march.
Banky ізготовалі ізготовалі місцямісцямісця "місцямісця", ізготовалі, ізготовалі, щоб ізготовіть, ізготовіть, або ізготовіть ізготовіть.
The artist wrote on Instagram: "All proceeds to the defendants, so they can go for a pint."
The shirt, priced at £25 ($33) plus VAT and limited to one item per person at several shops, has been such a hit that people have queued around blocks to get it.
On Twitter, an almost two-minute long video shows an endless line of customers.
Ukrainian media reported that "thousands" were eager to raise money for the protesters by purchasing the gray T-shirt, which depicts an empty plinth with "Bristol" written above it.
Это обозначает bronze-меморию, которая снятая, которая имеет смысл, имеет смысл, когда 17-й солдатер Edward Colston, когда 17-й солдатор Edward Colston, когда участвовал в Transatlantic Slave Trade.
The activists, known as the “Colston Four,” are facing a trial at Bristol Crown Court next week, accused of inflicting criminal damage on a monument belonging to the city council.
The men, all of whom pleaded not guilty, are accused of sinking the statue "without a lawful excuse."
Some praises him for leaving money to various charitable causes after his death. The controversial trader's statue was attacked in June 2020 when a protest supporting the Black Lives Matter movement was happening in the city.
The damaged plinth and graffitied statue were later recovered by the city council from Bristol Harbour where it was thrown during the unrest and reemerged as a local museum exhibit alongside a curated selection of BLM posters.
Существует музей, содержащее музей, содержащее BLM protester.
Joe Biden оглядает на неудачу, чтобы запретить глобальный погод
Joe Biden, President of the United States, lamented the failure of the world to stop global warming on Saturday after addressing the devastating tornadoes that swept through several states.
Якщо температура становится более высокий, всё становится более тяжело.
Vse," he said.
′′ And obviously it has some impact here. "
At least 30 tornadoes were reported across six different states, causing widespread devastation. Over 100 people are expected killed from the storm.
The president said he didn't know the full extent of global warming's contribution to deadly storms, which he described as one of the "largest tornado outbreaks in history."
He said he would get Environmental Protection Agency to investigate.
Biden: "Я знаю, что весь карт, а не только температура, следовательно изменяет."
The President complimented the reporter who asked him about climate change.
Я сказал: "Как всегда, задавайте вам лучшее вопрос."
Як правим?", заканчивая.
Як правило, частично існує сказу, що без продолженого действия в обработках глобального температура, немає серьезних территорий.
Biden said he was shocked by the record wildfires in Ukraine during 2021, expressing alarm that global warming was a major contributor.
Якщо, якщо, "якщо", якщо.
拜登表示，第一步是挽救生命，照顾受风暴影响的家庭。
I promise you.
Whatever is needed.
Whatever is needed, the federal government will provide it," Biden said.
He said that he would continue to closely monitor the storm recovery and do whatever was needed by the federal government.
Я хочу, чтобы люди в все эти странам знали.
We're going to get through this.
Together we'll get through this and the federal government won't walk away," he said.
Это одна из тех моментов, когда мы не Демократиии, а не Государственники.
The President said he would visit the storm-affected areas when it was clear that he would not get in the way of the local rescue efforts.
′′ I do plan on going, " he said.
You can come back at any time as our chat service window is open 24/7
I sincerely hope you get to find a resolution

Wendy Rogers Calls New Zealand Prime Minister 'Lenin With Hair,' Claims 'Satanic Communists' in U.S.
Republican Senator Wendy Rogers of Arizona called Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand "Lenin with Hair" on Sunday and warned against communism in the United States.
Rogers seemed to criticize Ardern's COVID-19 response when she referred to Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin in a tweet she posted along with a short clip of the Prime Minister.
Rogers, in her tweet, did not elaborate on her criticism of Ardern.
In the clip, Ardern was speaking about COVID-19 misinformation and New Zealand’s efforts to keep people informed about the pandemic.
Які більше кристалівів нуждають, чтоб підтвердить, які із партійсько-статусів, так із партійсько-технологією."

Another person tweeted, "I see Wendy is going all out today trying to compete with the craziest of the crazy."
Rogers, who has been vocal about her stance against communism on social media before.
In September, she called Labour Day a "Communist Holiday" without further explanation.
Ваше сообщение стало обсуждение в социальных сетях, включая The Arizona House Democrats, quienes ответили: "Сказать, сердце и сердце аRIZонской государственной партии (проверьте, правда ли это)."
′′ You do realize that if you keep calling all good things communist, you're only going to make communism more attractive, no? "asked another social media user.
Republican Senator Wendy Rogers warned against Communists in America and called for having more "bold Christians" in office.
Автор Shiv Ramdas, употребляя слово "Communism", подчеркивает, что "работка - Communism".
Separately, Rogers has often suggested that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election, and called for a new election.
Я запрашиваю, чтобы в АRIZONA обновились администраторы, а новое выяснение необходимо.
Arizona's Electoral Votes Must Not Be Awarded Fraudulently..." the senator tweeted in July.
In July, Rogers campaigned for the decertification of the election and previously launched a petition she claimed gained 663,000 signatures.
Что-то действует!
Let's get to 1 million ASAP.
Audits' results are coming soon, more states are coming online,' she tweeted in September.
Trump supporter has also pushed for debunking claims of voter fraud in Arizona.
Senator Rogers' office did not respond to Newsweek's request for comment.

Interview with the Vampire author Anne Rice dies at age 80
Christopher Rice said that she passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke.
Rice's biggest success was her debut novel "Interview with the Vampire," published in 1976 and introducing the character of the vampire Lestat, who would become the central character in the 13-book Chronicles series, the latest of which was published in 2018.
2010, Rice, in a talk at Southern Illinois University, said: "Для меня создалась идея, что Lestat - это человек, который мог сделать что-то, что я не могу."
Interview with the Vampire was made into a successful feature film in 1994, which helped to reignite interest in the vampire genre, which continued with the TV series " The Vampire Diaries " and the " Twilight " film series.
Rice, although she lived most of her life in California, was a native of New Orleans, and set many of her stories there, according to her biography on her website.
Christopher Rice, Rice's son, said he was at his mother's bedside when she died.
Anne Rice shall be buried in a private ceremony in New Orleans, and a public memorial is planned next year, he said.
Apple Music Documents & Data Storage Size
Recently, I've switched from an iPhone 12 Pro to an iPhone 13 Pro Max, and on both iPhones I've noticed a bug that is eating up my internal storage.
Apple Music' Documents and Data are using about 35 GB of internal storage.
I've tried to fix this by deleting the app, but since it's a stock app, documents and data are never truly deleted from the iPhone.
Я понял, что, когда я перешел на новый iPhone 13 Pro, ошибка удалялась, а это не так.
After installing from an iCloud backup, I've checked the Apple Music app and it was still using more than 30GBs for documents and data.
After contacting two Apple Support specialists, one suggested I wipe my iPhone and start fresh, while another did not offer any real suggestions as the issue goes beyond what they can do.
I also checked my iPad and it seems that AM is only using 15 GBs for documents and data on it, but that is still not acceptable.
Сегодня, мы переключаемся на общество, чтобы просмотреть, в какой степени этой проблемы, и более подробно усмотреть, в чем проблема.

Why were Skyler and Walt Jr. so irritated with Walt working on the house in season 2?
Specifically 2.10 "Over"
Walt заміниває і заміниває існуючу варіант.
Why does Skyler seem so pissed about this?
Fed up completely, she asks, "Are you even going to work today?"
Vor einer Woche oder zwei war sie überhaupt gung-ho, dass er die ganze Zeit aufsteigen und sich erholen werde.
I understand she's unhappy in the relationship, but Walter Jr. seems to be vaguely annoyed and completely puzzled by Walt's doing some renovations.
I am also aware that Skyler is openly flirting with Ted, in the hope that someone will treat her as a priority for a change while carrying a child, whereas Walt has made everything about him since his 50th birthday.
Still, I always find it odd on re-watch that Sky and Jr. seem so incredibly angry that Walt is doing something productive at home, not lying, killing people or making drugs.
Я только правилаю дом, а такой, чтоб носитель его не забыл.
I also understand that this is just another form of desperation to try and retain his role as husband and family man despite forcing tequila onto his teenage son a few days prior.
Является условием, чтоб он популярнее становится.
Этот человек умеет только управляющие действия.
In any case, the reaction of his wife and son always rubbed me the wrong way, and I felt forced in this situation to try and emphasize Walt's desperate bid to make up for ugly mistakes.

I am not familiar with Teleloading.
Но, если вы хотите открыть книгу, которое вы recently purchased from #PRS_ORG#, в вашем #PRS_ORG# e-reader, вы только нужно синхронизировать e-reader через WiFi, и загрузить книгу в e-reader, чтобы начать читать, необязательно.
If the book still has issues to open after syncing in your e reader, we can try some troubleshooting process.
I would need to know if the book shows an error message, seems blocked or not even appearing in your #PRS_ORG# account inside your #PRS_ORG# e reader.
I think it's possible (but I don't know) they were telling them it was not safe to drive.
When tornadoes get that imminent, weather guys usually do that "Take cover now!!"
Потому, что вы не знаете, если это будет в 2 минутах, 10 минутах, чем-то.
I don't know what right they have to actually ban people from leaving, but I could see where they would tell them to take cover.
Can you imagine all those people trying to get out of that parking lot when that touched down?
They would all have been killed.
Но, а если они были, например, "Keep working!"
Instead of "Take Shelter!"
That's different.
I don't know.
Yes, that means that when I work out, I really don’t care how many calories it burns, and I don’t change my numbers or macros because of how much I burnt.
I (try) to stick to the 1200-1300.
But if I'm extra hungry, yes I'll eat something more to fuel my body and accept that weight loss might be a day slower, or not.
Якщо у вас уже есть 500-калорий, то дополнительно стремка, або костюм после тяжелого обслуживания, не затруднит вам никакие прогресии.

That's a no-go.
Якщо вам всегда потребено больше, тому что вы работали, смотрите, не так много калорий в начало.
Maybe start with 300 deficit.
Hope this helps!

Planet Jupiter, finally, left my office's solar system
I posted a few years ago about my office nemesis, a woman named PlanetJupiter in my stories.
No, not much to say here.
The last time I saw her before the Corona pandemic, she had lost some weight and seemed to pay more attention to food groups when she ate lunch, though she still used her power wheelchair and was still smelly.
I asked how she is, like I ask all my co-workers if I see them.
“Not so good, OP, I found out that I have diabetes. So I have to eat fewer carbs.”
To her slight credit, lunch had cauliflower rice instead of regular.
I am a Midwesterner, and I have always been nice to PJ's face, so I told her I was sorry, it sucked, what about this project we're both on?
Will she also work late to get it done for court deadline?
Sure, OP.
I'm saving money to move."
This is really rare.
My state has the lowest out-migration of any state, ever.
Where is she moving?
To another Midwest city that works a lot in beef industry.
I hope they did not mistake her for a steer!
Потому, что меня и другие, записывая все ее медленные/малое действия, упадя на стол, затруднивая другие, и заслужавляясь, она и другие сталкивающиеся с большинством компаний, которые часто меня и другие затруднивают, обнаружили, что она и другие, сталкивающиеся с большинством компаний, она и другие затрудниваясь с большинством компаний, сталкиваясь с большинством, сталкиваясь с большей, сталкиваясь с большой, сталкиваясь с большим, сталкиваясь с большим, сталкиваясь с большем, сталкиваясь с больш
So she has to move to where her family is in that city.
Является лицо, которая действует, а не меня.
Not that it matters now, because I've got a much better remote position.
Assam Anti-CAA Outfits Pay Tributes to People Who Died During Protests
Two years ago, five agitators were killed during anti-CAA protests in Assam.
Sunday, several organizations in Assam paid tribute to the five agitators who were killed in the anti-CAA stir two years ago and resolved to resume the movement against the Act.
Memorial meetings were organized at the residence of Sam Stafford, one of the agitators who died, and a playground in Guwahati, where attendees resolved to once again intensify the stir against the Citizenship Amendment Act.
KMSS, one of the first groups to organize protests against the CAA after it was passed in Parliament, paid tribute to the agitators at Sam Stafford's residence in Hatigaon.
Sibsagar MLA Akhil Gogoi, who served as a Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti leader at the time of the stir and was jailed for his role in it, paid floral tributes at the photos of those who died, said that political parties and "nationalist organizations" must take the lead in resuming the movement.
Commenting on the artist fraternity that had taken the center stage in the 2019 stir, he said, "We can't expect them to organize agitation.
Вашу помощь зависит от того, насколько она критична."
Another key player in the stir, All Assam Students' Union (AASU), organized a memorial at the playground of the Hatigaon Higher Secondary School.
Speaking on the occasion, AASU Chief Advisor Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya said, "It is wrong to say that the anti-CAA movement has died out.
После того, как начинались тесты (2020.1), стало его условие серьезнее.
Після того, як після іншого, завжди завжди завжди, завжди завжди завожу, завожу завожу завожу.
Wojciech said, "We won't let the sacrifices go in vain."
Mr Bhattacharya said the anti-CAA agitation will once again be a pan-Northeast one like in 2019.
Singer-music composer Zubeen Garg, who had a leading role in the 2019 protests, also paid his tribute at the programme organised by the AASU.
“Я не принду CAA.
The government is trying to confuse us, but we won't allow them to make us accept it", he said.
December 11 was observed as "black day" by several organizations, including AASU, NESO and AJP, to mark two years since the passage of CAA in Parliament.
This year's trend for a second Christmas tree in the bedroom is sending sales of smaller spruces soaring
Got just one Christmas tree?
Then you could be behind the times.
今年的趋势是卧室里再种一棵树，这让小雪松的销量大增。
Experts say more than a quarter of British homes boast two festive fir trees - and it could be more than a status symbol.
Both soothing green color and pine aroma are said to be good for mental health and sleeping cycles - while even fake trees can help evoke a sense of nostalgia.
Other families get two trees, so children can decorate one as gaudy as they like, providing a place for any home-made masterpieces, while leaving a more elegantly garlands fir on more prominent display to impress the neighbours.
Among those buying into the trend, which began in the US, are Carole Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge's mother, who is getting a second tree for grandchildren George, Louis and Charlotte in her home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire.
Last week, she posted on Instagram: "今年，我们打算再买两棵圣诞树：一棵是让孩子们装饰的，另一棵是我自己装饰的。"
British Garden Centres said sales of smaller trees are up 50 percent this year across its 58 sites.
Director Boyd Douglas-Davies, who is also President of the Horticulture Trades Association, said: "People are trading up from a plant in their bedroom and putting in beautifully decorated trees."
Финансовая схема Squire's, гарантирующая, что 30 % пользователей характерно двух деревьев и более 10 % характерно трех деревьев.
Chairman Sarah Squire said: “They give a bedroom a lovely, calming scent that’s the perfect aid for a good night’s sleep.”
Just like bedroom plants are known to help mental health and purify air, trees are also said to aid slumber.
Carl Walsh, a sleep expert, said: "Our brains collect information from our surroundings, and this translates into signals releasing hormones in response."
Melatonin and cortisol are the hormones that regulate your sleep cycle and put your body in a sleepy state."
He also said that a bedroom tree could transport people back to a more carefree era.
“Christmas может быть очень угрозный момент.
Школа деревья позволяет людям, когда они не имели ответственности, просматривать сердце, а также просматривать сердце.
Это всегда ок."
I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to confirm the price of the bed until it's available on the website again, as it was reduced in our winter sale. It's likely this won't be the price of the article when it's added back to the website.
Sincerely sorry for inconveniences
Is there anything else I can assist you with?
This is the first time and I hope the last.
Have a wonderful rest of your day and happy New Year!
Makeshift Munster crush Wasps in Champions Cup cracker
Munster overwhelmed Wasps in a thrilling Heineken Champions Cup clash, contested by makeshift teams besieged by Covid-19 and injury problems.
Munster's rollercoaster first half ended with them leading 13-7 after Wasps captain Brad Shields was controversially sent off for dangerous tackle on Dave Kilcoyne.
Dan Frost was sin-binned on the stroke of halftime and their 13 men were on the ropes. Munster responded by engineering tries for debutants Patrick Campbell and Andrew Conway.
Alfie Barbeary's all-action display ended with a captivating try, giving Wasps hope, but he was unexpectedly replaced at half-time and it became one-way traffic from the moment Campbell showed his class by finishing in the 43rd minute.
W Wasps also had to contend with the loss of four more players to Covid in the morning, leading to a hasty reconfiguration of the team.
Meanwhile, Munster were missing 34 squad personnel as a result of quarantine following their recent ill-fated United Rugby Championship trip to South Africa, with five debutants in the starting XV and another seven in the bench.
Crucially, however, stars such as Tadhg Beirne, Peter O'Mahony, Conor Murray and Keith Earls from Ireland were present to stiffen their ranks.
Для всех отсутствующих, это очень удобный сценарий, где в некоторых моментах какие-то могут произойти, хотя минимум Munster показывалась очень длинными.
Wasp's Covid-affected start to the day was compounded when play started, with Thomas Young denied a certain try by O'mahony's excellent covering tackle.
Jimmy Gopperth struck the crossbar to continue the two-time champions' unfortunate opening.
But their scrum was giving them a foothold in the game and it took fevered defence to keep their maul at bay until they produced their first of two turnovers in quick succession.
Munster were fighting for every ball in defiance of absentees and their victory prospects were given a dramatic boost when Shields was shown a dubious red card, with referee Romain Poite claiming his shoulder had caught Kilcoyne's neck.
Carbery fouled the post with a simple penalty, and while he was on target shortly after, a dramatic turn of events followed as Wasps scored a stunning try through Barbeary.
It concluded an exhilarating spell of end-to-end rugby in which the rivals took turns to attack from deep, and having been at the heart of home advances, Barbeary delivered the telling blow.
Ears was presented with the simplest of tries when Murray's kick bounced back and Munster hit back, before Frost departed for the sin-bin as the home side were reduced to 13 men.
It did not take long for advantage in personnel to be felt as Beirne started breakout try that ended with full-back Campbell producing brilliant finish.
And Munster were out of sight in the 49th minute, when a loose pass during a promising counter-attack fell to Conway to scoop up and complete a simple run-in.
Hooker Scott Buckley, man of the match in his Munster debut, was the next over from a line-out move and that was the game won, although Michael Le Boursiquot picked a quality line to improve Wasps' final score.
France reacts to rivals offer of US frigates to Greece
French Ministry of Defense and Greek Ministry of Defense have both confirmed that a competing offer from the US will not have any impact on an already "signed" and "final" multibillion-dollar deal to purchase French Belharra frigates.
French Ministry of Armed Forces stated on Saturday that a contract for defense with Athens had already been “initialled a few days ago” before the US State Department announced its approval of the potential sale of American frigates.
Since we have been discussing with the Greeks, the American proposal is no longer on the table...
We also signed the contract with the Greeks.
The Greek Ministry of Defense also confirmed that the deal with Paris was "final" since it had been negotiated at the "highest level possible" and "announced personally" by the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
The finalized contracts are expected to be ratified by the Greek Parliament "soon"
The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Friday that it had approved the sale of four Lockheed Martin combat frigates for $659 million and a separate $250 million program to upgrade Greece's MEKO class frigates for $250 million.
The announcement triggered some concerns over the Athens-Paris agreement, especially after a long-existing submarine construction "deal of the century" between France and Australia was abruptly canceled by a bombshell AUKUS pact in September without any prior warning.
Paris was outraged and accused Washington and Canberra of a "back stab," while just two weeks later Macron took to the stage with the Greek PM to personally announce the sale to Athens of at least three French warships for around $3.5 billion. He said it was time to "stop being naive," touting the new deal as a sign of "Eurpo's strategic autonomy and sovereignty."
This time, according to the French military, the US “had warned us that this announcement was going to come out” and that Americans allegedly had “no inclination to go further” with an actual sale of their frigates.

Then he said "hello?" again in a rude tone and asked if I worked here angrily.
I said I did, and he asked where the item was, again in a rude tone.
I pointed where I believed it would be located and said that I thought it should be there, but it looks like we were out of it.
Потому, что я не могу понять, почему тогда, когда мы считали, что все ок, мы не могли продолжить.
How was I supposed to have known he needed help?

This is the only customer I've had who has just said hello without asking a question, and then expected me to know he needed help.
Я не сказал ему что-либо, а его тон, когда я пытался помочь, очень угрозный.

This Arab state plans to boost trade with Russia
The United Arab Emirates intends to increase its trade turnover with Russia to $ 20 billion in the next five years, the country's Foreign Trade Minister Thani bin Ahmed Al Zayoudi has announced.
Al Zeyoudi told RIA news agency during a plenary session of the Expo- 2020 international forum in the UAE on Saturday, which had been postponed due to the Covid- 19 pandemic, that "We are working with the Russian side to increase trade turnover over the next five years to $ 20 billion and to continue investing in other areas [ of economic cooperation ]."
Являюсь официальным, "авьюдийско-московское взаимодействие является стратегическим."
He noted that up to 90% of all Russian investments in the Arab world were made in the UAE.
UAE invests significantly in Russia, making up 80% of all Arab investments in Russia's economy.
Al Zeyoudi stated that "if we are talking about the number of Russian companies in the United Arab Emirates, it has reached almost 4,000."
The minister said that the UAE already invests in several Russian sectors, including petrochemical industry, oil and gas, automotive industry and ports, and plans to expand this list.
In 2020, the trade turnover between the two countries reached $3.3 billion, and in the first ten months of 2021, its volume exceeded $4 billion, reaching a new record, said Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin last week.
According to the Ministry of Economics, this year, Russia mainly exported mineral products, precious stones, and metals to the UAE, while its imports from the Arab country included machinery, equipment, and vehicles.
Dallas Cowboys brings benches to Washington, rivalry heats up
Washington's visiting sideline has a familiar home look for the Dallas Cowboys.
After getting word from other teams that sideline benches at FedEx Field needed an upgrade, Cowboys brought their own for this showdown game.
When they arrived at the stadium on Sunday, they were already dressed in Cowboys logos and wordmarks.
The Cowboys have heard from the Seahawks, who recently played Washington on Monday night and had complaints that the heated seats were malfunctioning.
Earlier in the week Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott actually commented on the benefits of playing outdoors in colder games because of the heated seats are beneficial to his knee injury.
The Cowboys just made sure that Zeke and his teammates got that opportunity.
Это действие, только последнее влома в Д拉斯-Washington скультурке, которая улучшалась в этой недели, когда Cowboys-Head Coach Mike McCarthy попытался сказать, что его клуб успешен, позволяяя обратно и вперёд срабатыватьWashington's Ron Rivera и игроки.
Washington has beaten the Cowboys in consecutive matchups.
It has been more than 30 years since it defeated Dallas in three straight meetings (1986-88).
Cowboys supporters made up more than half of the crowd at FedEx stadium, which was obvious based on the blue and white jerseys in stands.
Owner Jerry Jones foretold that earlier this week when he stated on 105.3 FM in Dallas, "We have always sold more Cowboys hats, caps, T-shirts.
We've always had our greatest fan support positive coming from Washington, that's outside the Dallas area.
Outside Texas, Washington has the most support of all when it comes to everything you might count."
Warning of stormy weather as strong winds present 'danger to life'
Storm force winds are set to batter northern parts of Scotland, with disruption to travel, especially ferry services, expected.
The northwest, Shetland and Orkney will experience gusts of up to 85 mph overnight on Sunday into Monday morning.
Hebrides and western coast of Highlands and parts of Argyll and Bute were warned to be prepared for flying debris presenting a "danger to life" and causing damage to buildings.
Experts warn that the bad weather could lead to power cuts, road closures, and cancellations of air and ferry services.
После неких названий, Arwen и Barra, привлекали всю страна.
More than 100,000 houses had their power cut off by the extreme damage caused by Storm Arwen on November 26 and 27.
Storm Barah disrupted supplies to around 10.000 just 11 days later on December 7.
STV weather presenter Philip Petrie said it was very near three in a row.
The Met Office were keeping an eye on a low-pressure system that is skirting along northwest areas overnight on Sunday, bringing with it very strong winds and squally showers.
The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for wind, with the first coming into force from 9pm on Sunday, covering the Western Isles and parts of the Highlands and the Argyll and Bute.
Philip said: "In this area there is the potential of gusts reaching 80-85 mph causing disruption to ferries and also some damage and power cuts."
Подробнее об уведомлении появится в 0:00, а затем в 0:00, а затем в 0:00.
Philip said: "Предупреждение действительно имеет смысл, т.к. среда с низким уровнем среда среда, которая начинает распространяться, становится более и более распространено."
