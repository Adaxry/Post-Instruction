According to my point of view, the program on literature formed the basis of Balzac's maturity based on their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Daniilovsky and Volkovsky.
They wrote ballads, of course, from the perspective of the very young Balazakis.
The psychology and motivation of heroes Tolstoy and Turgeniev for the common people are not so interesting.
In short, the psychology of heroes is rarely interesting.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Germany: Fourth death from coronavirus inevitable
Fourth vaccination is needed in summer or autumn 2022.
According to the expert, the new wave of coronavirus infection in Greece will not be decisive, but will continue with new strength.
Despite an active campaign of vaccination in Germany, two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine probably will not be enough for full protection.
In this confident leader, the Association of Doctors of General Practice of Ulrich Wageleitd is represented.
This was announced by Die Welt on Friday, November 11.
We are waiting for the fourth inactivation, the earliest possible autumn," an expert said.
In addition, Waghild believes that it may be possible to carry out the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus "in combination with the vaccination against the flu".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced ventilation can help fight the spread of the new coronavirus variant "Omikron".
In addition, the new variant is particularly dangerous.
This means that the chance of reinfection with "Omikron" is three times higher than with Delta or Beta.
The results of the preliminary investigation conducted in UAR are indicative of this.
According to this, manufacturers BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide the vaccine to the market in 2022, adapted for Omikron.
Companies point out that two doses of the vaccine do not provide enough protection against the new variant of coronavirus "Omikron".
The study of BioNTech and Pfizer showed that when two doses are given, the efficacy is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times".
This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the Omicron variant," BioNTech and Pfizer added.
This is why a third rope is needed.
Experts are calling for speeding up the vaccination campaign in the country.
For example, the chairman of the Belarusian Association of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Zallinger, is calling for a reduction in the interval between the second and third dose.
More to the point, as Zalcberger thinks, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the Delta and the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
The "experience of Iran is very convincing," the expert added.
Vobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 kg
Series Bet-A-Vib - a unique way to invest in Bet-A from the company Pontoon21®.
She (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from the majority of other vibes in that it was originally designed to be used for a paddle, rather than just for loafing around.
These worms have a greater, than their closest relatives by geography, optimal weight, which is certainly a positive reflection on the potential benefits of these interesting little creatures.
Another noteworthy feature is the upper lip, which is slightly curved from the inner and outer lips, creating additional shading for vertical and horizontal lips.
As a "sneaky villain" in the game Bet-A-Vib, he demonstrates quite a vicious game.
The most common is a simple monotone animation, that is, the character is moving up and down almost imperceptibly.
When planning the detour away from the vertical axis, it is not very large, which is convenient in a limited space, densely populated coastal area, with rocks and other obstacles, which can be avoided.
In addition, a slight tilt of the pelvis is currently of great importance for the prevention of hip and knee osteoarthritis, especially in the middle of winter, when precise and dynamic loading is required.
Reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A- Vib rapidly deflects and returns to its original vertical.
At least as successful as Bet-A-Vib is also used for winter sores.
To mute her chatter, one can choose between two modes: with the noise-cancelling cap (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It was also noted that Bet-A-Vib games are capable of breaking down spasticity, which is not even triggered by movement.
At the same time, the Bet-A-Vib delivers depth and precision.
This tree is known and not poisonous, it harmoniously combines with lily and plum blossoms even large diamonds.
For loaves of sourdough, sourdough, rye or oatmeal bread, apart from being nutritious and "healthy", sometimes with a "crunch" in the middle.
If you catch in confined spaces, you can switch to a quad, which will reduce the chance of entanglement.
Among the pleasures of his own class, Bet- A- Vib is one of the most durable in work and, as a consequence, one of the most reliable.
It can be used on both relatively small and very deep parts.
All models are based on the ST- 36.

In Libya, 7 million Russian nationals
In Libya, there are more than 7,000 members of the common military company (CMC) "Vagner".
This was stated by the President of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Hashem al-Misri on Friday, December 12.
At present, in Lithuania there are more than 7 million "Chevengers".
They have wings.
They also roost in the trees and caves.
They have 30 active fighter jets on their airbases in the Garda peninsula (also used as a civilian airport in Istanbul) ", - the agent Anadolu quoted him as saying.
Khalid al-Mishri also said Russian militants are "attempting to capture" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their people to power" in Central Africa.
Save presence
According to the publisher's representative, Moscow was looking for a country to keep its presence in the Southern African region and "positioned itself in Libya."
The “Avenger” is located in Libya, using an airstrip and a port in Sirte, as well as an airstrip in Jufra, according to the agency's publications.
Russian authorities have officially denied that the CVC is a "virus."
Where can there be more beggars
According to the agency, "Vanguer" is likely to be active in nine countries in Africa - Chad, Liberia, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Madagascar and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders and protection of energy objects.
In exchange for these services, the subsidiaries "Vangnera" receive certain privileges and licences to use beneficial and natural resources, as well as to set up weapons, technologies and military services in these countries," the article states.
As confirmed by the SMC, “volunteers” entered Donbass, Syria, the Caucasus, Sudan and Central Asia.
This group is not significant in either symbolic or literal property, nor in registries of births, and its members do not appear in formal lists of personal composition.
The company is listed on the SSE.
Remember, 27 countries of the EU approved the resolution against "Vaegner".
The decision is expected to be ratified by the EU Council on 13 December.
Situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania is the second party in the parliamentary coalition with consultative functions, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting for the deputies to the Parliament and the members of the Government with at least 24 December as the minimum date for February 2022.
There are less than two days left before the elections, and the chances are rapidly decreasing that they will pass the deadline," the document states.
In the background, a High Court panel in Libya has adjourned the final list of candidates to an unspecified date, handing over the baton to Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy of the Russian eye
38% of Russians see their country's foreign policy as having more successes than failures, while 29% consider that failures outnumber successes.
Examples of successes - "In Syria, they protected, restored the world there," "the decision on the South Stream-2" "the world was stunned by what was a major military build-up," "Crimen were defeated."
The main difficulties - "conflict with Ukraine", "conflicts with neighboring countries", "isolation from the world" - are mentioned in the study "Foundation of public opinion".
The government of Dubaï completely rejected the manufacture of luxury goods - all privileges became just numbers
The government of Dubaï announced a complete withdrawal from the production of luxury goods and a switch to digital technologies.
All government services will be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This was reported by WAM's electronic information agency.
This evening marked the beginning of a new phase in the digitalization of all aspects of Duba's life - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government, declared the Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Executive Council of Duba, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Now, internal and external document orientation will only be carried out digitally in all districts of Dubaï through specially designed information platforms.
The announcement devastated all sectors without exception, from healthcare, to social security, to politics, to voluntary bodies, to courts and more. Many commercial structures also joined the initiative of the government.
The transition to electronic government and digitization of documents began in Dubaï in 2018.
At that time, according to estimates, 336 million pieces of paper were saved, which amounts to 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 billion dollars in equivalent cash.
In the past, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin claimed that electronic services save citizens two days a year.

These people knew exactly who was at home...
Production and export of automobiles in Turkey fell below the 2020 level
Production and export of automobiles in Turkey have sharply declined in November on the back of depreciation of the lira.
As a result, manufacturing indicators posted worse-than-expected results, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, 115,000 vehicles were exported from Turkey in November, down 20 per cent on the same month a year ago.
About 75.9 thousand machines were exported, which is more than 25% higher than the previous record.
And if the results of the first 10 months of this year showed a positive dynamic for the automotive sector in comparison to last year, the results of 11 months in 2021 turned out to be worse by 0.3% compared to the previous year.
The reason for the fall was a sharp decline in the course of tulip bulbs, which in November had lost 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 subscribers of the MSB received a discount for credit payment in 2021
The first substitute manager Aly Khan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of liquidity for small and medium-sized businesses, passing on the representative of MIA "Kazinfom".
According to the information from the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan on regulation and development of the financial market, in the current year, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan approved the Resolution of the Board of Directors of 9 April 2021 № 127 "On approval of the Order of priority for settlement of claims for payment of fees for subcontracts of medium and small business" - wrote Alexan Smailov in his response to the parliamentary question.
He reminded that the order of payment of claims under the guarantee was stipulated by the guarantee provider banks and organizations performing microfinance activities, including IP, from 1 April 2021.
The processing time ranged from 30 to 90 days, depending on the selection of the subject of the MSB.
In the claim, the insurer could specify a different time limit for payment.
During the period of calculation in relation to the beneficiary, pro bono work was suspended, notice of the need to appoint a guardian was issued, as well as the acceptance of creditor commissions and other claims," the guardian noted.
In 2021, in banks of the second level, there were requests for the reduction of payments for debt of 603 debtor-subjects of the MSB, of which 553 subjects of the MSB received reduction of payments for a total amount of 9.7 million tenge.
In the MFO, 131 requests for reimbursement were made, of which 95 were approved for a total amount of 105.8 million teng," - concluded A. Smilov.
Pulmonologist Puryasov suggested that people with a weak immune system are able to easily shift to the "immunosuppressant" stage
Doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system may be able to cope with it easier than those with a strong protective reaction to the system
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why a coughing coronavirus can be dangerous.
The cause is to be found in the conditions of breeding the virus.
Students believe that "ociron" was created in the brain of an infected person or a patient with failing immune system.
So, when he was moved, he did not encounter any opposition to intimacy.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no response from the mod, he became very fast.
Clearly, there are such spikes and bumps there, these spikes and bumps, probably more than stated, and their anti-teeth were not eroded during the mutations - comments pathologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may be able to tolerate the virus more easily than those with a strong protective reaction to the system.
It seems that a strong response to anything, to any infection - is not always good.
In such cases, the system can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumonia, when a young child contracts the disease and an elderly adult passes it on.
The immune response of a young child is completely inappropriate, he concluded: there, where one could only sneeze into a pillow, he is crying like a baby from hunger.
Doctor also reminded that coronavirus has dangerous contagious symptoms and the most unpleasant of them all - pneumonia.
The recovery of mild cases is often bacteriological and viral.
If the first case is successfully treated and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to buy only symptoms - all hope is on the system.
The first sign of developing neuropathy will be an increase in temperature, softness, and numbness.
Then come the reproductive symptoms: Difficulty breathing, chest pain.
Pain on the right or left side, and abdominal pain can also be a sign of a developing problem.
At the same time, in Russia, by the end of the year, vaccination of adolescents aged 12 to 18 may begin.
Pathologist, head of the Laboratory of Genetic Immunology of the MFTI Pavel Volkov noted that this category is very active in suffering from cancer.
For students who attend school, the number of contacts is maximum.
This is the most socially active way to propagate, as well as the seedlings of children's gardens, - said "24 Moscow" Pavel Volkov, a virologist and head of the laboratory of genetic engineering of the MFTI.
The author is immensely grateful for this article.
She smiled with satisfaction as she recalled...
Teath-in.
In those distant decades, no one in the group needed a nap.
And at home, gathered with friends, they sang along to their music.
Immunologists have raised the hypothesis that why people with anxiety become martyrs of cowardice
Authors of the work studied living tissue left over from cataract surgery and discovered that living cells, known as adipoocytes, can be infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells, located in living tissue, macrophages, also showed up, with a strong stimulatory response.
Students also studied living tissue from patients who died from Covid-19 and discovered coronavirus fragments in dead, surrounding different organs.
It is known that viruses such as HIV and grippe can pass through a dead cell, using it as a reservoir, in attempts to evade the immune system.
It is likely that this ability is also possessed by SARS-CoV2.
The biologist explained the reasons for the appearance of the disease
Scientist Semen Gholoshkin, a candidate of biological sciences, named the reasons for the appearance of menopause and told about the ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO data, more than 55 million people are suffering from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as gradual deterioration of cognitive functions - over time, a person becomes increasingly difficult to orient in familiar surroundings.
Goldstein noted that the most common cause of dementia is neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, some infections, metabolic disturbances and deficiency of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hyperactivity, diabetes, raised cholesterol levels, obesity, sleep apnea, depression and Alzheimer's disease.
At the behavioral level, such factors as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity", he said.
In addition, bad habits such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, binge eating, sexual abuse, and a sedentary lifestyle also contribute to the development of depression.
Among the first signs of an expert is forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, and lowering of abstract thinking.
There is discussion as to whether loss of smell could be a more early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, or one of the risk factors for its onset, added the biologist.
For the prevention of diseases, it is recommended to support the necessary level of physical activity, train cognitive habits and abilities, which require involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of neurology, neurohirurgy and medical genetics at the FGU VOV RDNIM.
N.I. Pirogov, head of the department of cognitive violations of the Federal Center for Mental Health and Neuro-psychology, Anna Bogolepova, spoke about the causes of the problem with memory.
Egypt returned about 30 tons of illegally exported artefacts from countries
For the past 10 years, the government of Kazakhstan has been able to return about 30 tonnes of artefacts, which were illegally exported from the country through contraband.
This was announced on the evening of November 11, in an interview with the Al Hayat television channel, the chief inspector of the Department of Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shahab Abdel Ghaoud, said.
In 2011, 29,300 artefacts were returned to Egypt from the Egyptian state.
Only this year, at the Museum of the Bible in Vienna, 5300 relics of the ancient Egyptian civilization have been discovered," he said.
Abdel Gawad clarified that all the seized documents were registered in files.
At present, employees of the depot are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists are "monitoring activity on the whole world and sales on the Internet" through Eastern European and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector told the BBC that cultural values are being restored and then displayed in museums.
According to his words, one of the returned artefacts has turned out to be a prehistoric knife found in België, which is now part of the Egyptian Civilization exhibition at the National Museum in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to INTERPOL for help in finding the perpetrator of a bank robbery at the Londe bank branch in Tanta.
Christie's auction house on July 4 conducted a bidding war on which the age was estimated to be more than 3,000 years old and was sold for US$5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused irritation on the side of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also confirmed that the object of art was illegally removed from the Karnak temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The skull of Taunkhamon, portrayed in the shape of the goddess Amon, was kept in a private collection and did not emerge on the market until 1985.
How the plague entered Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively engaged in repairing illegally excavated monuments from various countries at different times.
According to the data, 95% of all banknotes are the result of archeological discoveries of "black clothes".
"Sea turtles are not taken into account" - this is correct, as sea turtles (232 tonnes) - this is a self-sufficient people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 million people - so many Turks (Caucasian) live in Crimea (see translation).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, with a name consisting of two words!
It only unites the Turkish-speaking group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its staff to provide bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes Financial Times.
The problem is that in Europe and in Central and Eastern Europe, the Slovak bank does not provide its employees with corporate facilities, but instead proposes a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, a bank can access information on corporate assets provided by its employees, as these are used for the resolution of disputes with colleagues or clients.
The bank uses the right to check mobile devices in the most extreme cases - for example, if a colleague used it to conduct meetings with a client, which were not approved Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff have moved to remote working, the bank wants to extend the rule to all devices used to answer working questions.
According to the newspapers, the bank's guidance set a final deadline for staff to get used to the new rules.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on new requirements.

Part 4
Last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 - was a miserable year in terms of creativity, but a crucial one for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego."
He has already strayed outside any literary alliances, delving into the realm of the grotesque, he himself, but known, lovable, mercurial, tempestuously critical, even loathsome, but the reading public ready to clutch him.
For a year, more than 60 scripts were written, many of them - finished short stories, the cycle "Persian Motives" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Russia Soviet Union".
The main success - at the end of June, the editor concluded a contract with Esene for the publication of his works in three volumes.
No one of the modern poets of Sergei Aleksandrovich has such integrity, he is the first!
On top of that, the salary was very good - according to the agreement, the general manager would receive 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, the director of the budget received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Funding was needed that year as never before.
Eserin was born in the womb of Leva Tolstoy Sofie Tolstoy, it was necessary to prepare a family bed, contain a sister Katya and a brother Saghu, as well as their mother.
Life seemed to be going on, there was something to be thankful for, but it was all overshadowed by the eerie tone, as if the material had been translated from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death):
My brother, my brother.
I am very sick.
I don't know where this big came from.
The wind is crying
Under the empty and desolate field
This is how easy it is in September
The oysters shrivel up.
Many of the acquaintances noted that Esenin looks very ill, looks very weak.
More and more people are getting sick with diarrhea and vomiting.
And the reason, probably, is not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - Alzheimer's disease - had been put on Sergei Alexandrovich, there were no reliable documents left.
Let's say, relating to May 1923, when Eisenin, for real, was a fourth wife, an American woman, Ayse Dorah Dunkan, corrected peace in the neighborhood of Paris under the auspices of Professor Petra Ganushkina (again, Eisenin will be there two years later, in Moscow).
But here's a warning for poets, songwriters on this subject, and performers in general: the chorus is in the key of C major, the melody is in the key of F major, and the bridge is in the key of G major.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a terrible novel by the author with a pale face was developing rapidly.
At the end of 1923 year, at a short time, Esenin passed on to the recipient, the nurse Ivana Starceva.
Surprisingly, but Esenin never had his own living space in Moscow or Piter, he was lodged in shared apartments, in hotels or with acquaintances.
Starcev recalled:
It came only at night and, in most cases, in a sleepy state.
Once, returning home in four hours, Essenin tripped on a slippery floor...
He fell down and collapsed onto his face and screamed.
As he got a little closer, he started hacking and ripping out the entire contents of his stomach..."
And after all, Esenin himself, after the war in Europe and in the USSR (at that time there was a poor law in the USSR, but Dunakov seized a decent savings account):
I saw nothing there but cabs and streets...
I am already at the end and people forget...
Well, and pill, of course...
I was crying because the skin was peeling off."

MID Moldova considers Belarusian use of minarets as "odious" against the EU
Moldova considers Belarus using minarets as 'ogre'
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Paweł Jabłoński, expressed that President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko used mercenaries as "ogre" against the European Union and is determined to return to such "operation next year."
Corresponding statement from MIAD was made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonski, sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively searching for new ways".
Polish prosecutor also believes that now illegal mines will be used as ammunition "in many points of the world".
As the site kp.ru wrote, earlier the European Union introduced a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He killed 17 people and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they declared readiness to expand restrictive measures against the republic "so long as the situation in the country does not improve."
Mining responded by introducing a voluntary embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously voted to impose sanctions on Belarus.

"Strike the iron while it's hot": When a barista makes a mistake
At the 2021 World Cup events, barbecue skewers dominated.
Unfortunately, the first person to declare their new mode of resolution was Daniel Craig.
In September, he appeared on the cover of the film "Never Let Me Die" in a baroque mask and a traditional "Bond Street" babydoll.
After his example, two-time last winner Ullaam, who had initially pledged a share in the Earthshot Prize for the most innovative answer to the challenge of tackling climate change, opted for the more classic version at the event in support of a charitable cause.
Four days ago, the trend was noticeable, and now Luna is here.
The football player came to collect the seductive "Dolce & Gabbana" dress in the baroque pencil skirt.
By the way, his siblings were killed in the same way.
AliExpress has already noted a growing demand for barbecue-style male underwear in Russia.
According to data from analytics service Gazeta.ru, they were bought 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are thin bar chart candlesticks with a down-turned and drawn-in body, the main colors being tawny-brown, chestnut-brown, tawny-yellow and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. Men prefer to buy exclusively razors - they choose them more often.
You can also buy them from online retailers.
H&M, Mango, Next and Zara all have budget options.
In the section devoted to leather jackets from the baroque period, practically all the breeds are represented - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
Gucci is considered one of the most elegant models, and one of the main characters in the film "Dom Gucci", the debut feature of director Burr Steers.
Choosing plugs with flat ends means you can be confident that the bar is made from steel.
Thanks to the special technology of blending, it is possible to obtain a smooth skin with a soft outer texture and a delicate inner side.
More budget-friendly options are made from clay or polymer clay, but they're also less durable.
Model expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhshkin warns that in the case of a bag with a bar code, the most important is not its model or shape, but its functionality.
The jacket requires evening light, so such a tuxedo is ideal for a cocktail party or formal event, explains Vakhshkin. - It will also work for those occasions if the invitation specifies "Black Tie," or "Creative Black Tie."
Another important criterion for making a selection in favour of a bar chart is the status of its purchaser.
The author of the Telegram channel "Krasavchik Brammell" believes that a man in a bar jacket should first of all ensure that he is wearing properly tucked in trousers. - The owners of bar jackets, as a rule, belong to the category of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to fancy-dressed summer parties, where always a drink code is indicated.
Ilya Vakhshkin suggests combining a pillow from a quilt with such same stackable items: conventional pillows with straps, one-piece pillows, velvet cushions, loofahs with sponges, and pads.
Too simple and mundane things will look out of place.
Modular experts from "Crusader Brammellla" are sure that the appearance of a row of assistants in a bar chart will not be acceptable for corporate governance, but if it is about a "manager from the number of people who are responsible for this event, then - yes, that is something to talk about".
If the assistant's rating is lower and its goal is to move up in the company's complex hierarchy or choose financial bonuses, then a bar chart is not the best way to go.
The advice is exactly what it says on the tin: not to wear a mask on a night out, say the editors of the Telegram channel.
Very unclear feelings from the vote.
This is not a real theme, so it is so annoying.
It is completely unrelated to the young girl.
Honestly, I don't understand the fear surrounding it.
But from the bottom of my heart, I want happiness in my life!
Everything is in dollars - alternative energy is well-lobbied, that is, priced.
Million-dollar investments.
Are they printed?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy is also not in demand - gas, coal and electricity are all being sold at deeply discounted prices, compared with today.
I have a question.
The cup is empty.
Who's in the pool?
As usual - a row of buyers.
Is there a problem with indexing that is causing the errors?
This is why it is not advisable to count downright foreign politicians as idiots, "exposing themselves" to the energy crisis.
They did their thing.
For a bad mood.
I didn't see a single handsome man in the photos in the article.
Just directness within the context of average statistics.
Maybe if those characters are so confident in their colour that they decide to show it off on a full stage, it won't offend as much.
But only because of psychological structure and lack of confidence in such "colorblind" people, but not because of their outward appearance.
Kazbek, "rab, signifying his rabbinic position and fighting against it, is a revolutionary.
Rab, not knowing his own folly and dreaming in a bland, meaningless and meaningless rabbic life, is just a rabbit.
There is a hole in the wall, through which slugs crawl, when he describes in detail the pleasures of rabbinic life and praises himself as a kind and good neighbor.
Immunologist said that vaccination after four to five months will help protect against the seasonal coronavirus "Imikron"
The vaccination over four to eight months can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "Imicron".
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolay Kruglov, who gave the baby the jab six months ago, taking into account the appearance of the new strain, "over a very long period of time"
In the past, such a period was considered normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic illnesses - in four," an expert said, calling for parallel with the vaccination campaign to carry out revaccination.
Kruchev also noted that early revascularization ensures a good blood supply to the ischemic tissue.
If a person had two vaccinations and a booster, or he had the flu and was vaccinated, or he was vaccinated and had the flu, then he received the "gibbied immunity," which is enough to prevent the flu, explained the expert.
The "large smear" warned Russia of "catastrophic consequences" in the event of defeat in Ukraine
The countries of the "Big Six" (Bulgaria, Hungary, Israel, Canada, Slovakia, France and Japan) published a statement on the outcome of the meeting of the heads of MIED in Luxembourg.
In the document, it is stated that "feudal aggression" from Russia against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be overcome" Moscow, but specific measures in the document do not specify.
We, ministers of foreign affairs of the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, united in our determination to strengthen the military power of Russia and its aggressive borders in relation to Ukraine, said in the statement.
Next, ministers called on Russia to "encourage encryption, use dynamic channels and comply with its international obligations in relation to transparency of military activities," President of the Czech Republic, Miloš Zeman, said during a videolink conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on July 7.
We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with the aim of regulating conflict on the eastern side of Ukraine," say the ministers of foreign affairs of the "Big Six".
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not be concerned that further military action against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price tag in response," they warn.
We confirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome a conciliatory position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our collaboration in response to our common and global challenges," the statement said.
Earlier this day, the head of the British Delegation to the EU, Elizabeth Truss, said that Russia would suffer "serious consequences" in the event of being excluded from Ukraine.
According to her words, this meeting showed "a unified voice of the strange 'Big Smerk'," on which 50% of global GDP is coming, and which is very clear to understand that the Ukraine crisis will have huge consequences for Russia."
Vaccine Pfizer is 32 times less effective at preventing Covid-19
The efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the mutant strain of the coronavirus was 32 times lower in comparison to other variants of the disease.
Students from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong came to this conclusion, South China Morning Post (SCMP) reports.
Vaccine is less effective based on the study of the antiviral activity of citizens who received two doses of the vaccine against COVID-19.
We see that the majority of people had a high level of anti-viral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the mutant variant," - said Professor Malick Peiris.
At the same time, the students emphasized that vaccination remains the most effective way to protect against potentially life-threatening diseases caused by the coronavirus.
In the past, students from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine diagnosed and treated patients with pneumonia caused by the coronavirus, taking into account the impact of the virus on the immune system.
Authors of the study came to the conclusion that microglial cells can trigger a new wave of virus replication and increase mortality if not given additional measures.
The main issue in the Ukrainian conflict is the blockade of the port of Mariupol by the Russian Federation
Ministry of Defence of Ukraine Alexander Reznikoff criticized the previous commander of the Armed Forces of Russia, General Angeli Merkel, for blocking the acquisition of lethal weapons by Kiev within the framework of the Nato.
In an interview with the Financial Times on 12 December, Reznikoff reminded that in the previous month, Hungary had imposed a quarantine on a group of Ukrainians for the purpose of preventing the spread of the plague.
At the same time, it is noted that more recently, Berlin has softened its position on the issue of nuclear weapons, acknowledging that they are no less deadly than conventional weapons.
According to the ministry, Kiev is determined to acquire the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with partners.
In particular, it is about Russia, Belarus, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, FT points out that the position of the new Czech government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Andrej Babis, remains unclear on the issue of granting permits for construction in Ukraine.
Earlier in the day, on the eve of the anniversary of the Ukraine's annexation by Armenia, Russia's ambassador to Georgia, Andrej Melnik, said that Kiev should not wait for Berlin to put a stop to the shelling of Slutsk.
According to his words, the previous Russian guidance explained his refusal to provide weapons to the DPRK in the risk of developing military conflict in the Demilitarized Zone, despite "compensating Russia" part of the Ukrainian territory.
Such a "non-logical" position, the diplomat is sure, Hungary will maintain and even strengthen in the new context.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev is waiting for help from Berlin in improving the maritime border.
In Ukraine, it is estimated that Hungary "will be a partner to Ukraine in a technical sense," added the president.
It was also noted that heavyweight current chairman of the "green" faction of the FPRG, Robert HabeK, visited the republic, where he made a pitch for sales of defensive weapons to Kiev.

Revealed ways to return stolen money through online stores
There are several ways to get your hard-earned cash back from online retailers and not become a victim of extortion in the future.
Experts have revealed the identities of the people behind the RBK hack.
So, to reduce the risk of losing large amounts of money when your bank card falls into the wrong hands, it's recommended to keep your main funds on the card or in a bank account that aren't used for online shopping.
Part of the proceeds can be deposited on a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend creating a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen when shoppers made purchases at stores that did not use 3D Secure security technology, a refund process can be initiated.
Responsibility for unauthorised transactions, carried out without the use of 3D Secure, is assigned to the member of the payment chain who does not use this service, explained the representative of Promosvyazbank.
Expert from international payment provider Ecommpay, Artyom Zeremba highlighted that the customer has the right to make a claim to the bank for reimbursement of expenses incurred in carrying out a monetary operation not later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the fraudster used a card on online resources that did not require two-factor authentication, the transaction could be reviewed and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases Internet stores return the money to the customer themselves if the order has not been delivered yet.
On November 19, a member of the Public Council, Director of the Department of Cybersecurity of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ekaterina Misulina, informed that only in 2021 were received 11 million requests for various forms of malicious activity: from selling individual documents to accessing personal data.
According to her words, the effective solution to the current situation could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online merchants.
Sholtz arrived in Poland for discussions on the "Southern Stream-2" and EU law
The newly-elected chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Varshav for consultations, focused on the crisis of migrants on the border with Belarus, independence of the Polish state from Russian influence, strengthening Russian military presence on the borders of Ukraine and the situation with Russian gas pipeline "Black Stream-2".
Although Scholtz declared his intention to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for years to come, leaders of the two countries expressed contradictory expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he will call on Slovakia to stand up against "South Stream-2", which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Hungary through Ukraine.
According to Morawetz, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political delay.
Meanwhile, Hungary supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it will help Varsava and Brusssel in regulating this crisis.
Polish electoral system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreements.
European Court of Human Rights upheld Poland's ban, stating that the substantive reforms carried out by the "Right and Justice" party violated European law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court has established that national law has priority over EU rules.
The new government of Georgia, presented to the parliament, despite the requirements of Poland and Slovakia, did not take public obligations to stop the work of "South Stream-2" in case of Russia's withdrawal from Ukraine.
American diplomats said Congresmen that they had reached understanding with Germany on stopping the gas supply if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior Congresman from the Czech Republic told reporters on Friday.
German officials did not confirm the messages, but Scholz warned that there would be consequences if Russia breaches Ukraine's borders, and that position was reiterated by representatives of "Big Semen" on Friday.

Minnesota wants to ban writers from mailing letters
The state will transfer federal property support for Russian book publishers, leaving it in the inheritance from the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Literary Fund of the USSR.

In the explanatory note, it is stated that the funds will help to worry about, among other things, the proper use and conservation of buildings and projects belonging to the Soviet Union, not belonging to the Soviet Union.
In the Russian Federation itself, a significant number of objects of immovable property, previously belonging to the Literary Fund of the USSR, passed into the ownership of the Russian Federation, including objects located in the village of writers of Prezdilki, the settlement of Komarov's Leningrad district and other places," the "Partisan gazette" reported in the Mining service.
The project stipulates that it is intended to express in the statute that it is "created with a view to promoting literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of authors."
The "creation of conditions for sexual activity" is understood to mean the creation of literary delegations in different regions of Russia, where there would be comfortable conditions for sexual activity," the Minority edition explained.

Vectors warn of dangers of long-term use of blood-thinning drugs after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Infectious diseases expert Irina Yarceva and Sergey Torkarev warned of the dangers of uncontrolled use of blood-thinning drugs after contracting coronavirus and before vaccination against the virus.
Doctor and immunologist Irina Yarceva said that individualized prevention of possible formation of blood clots after COVID-19 could prevent stroke.

The doctor prescribed anticoagulants (blood thinners that prevent blood clots) according to the patient's symptoms.
She said that at the moment there is an epidemic of diarrhea - everyone is crying out for antidiarrheals and getting complications on top of that in the form of gastrointestinal infections (blood in the stool).
Head of the Department of Preventive Medicine of the URA, academic director of the Community of Specialists in Preventive Medicine, doctor of medical sciences Sergey Torkarev told BNS that uncontrolled anti-coagulants are commonly used in Russia today, and before and during the treatment of coronavirus infection.
According to the doctor's words, citizens are giving dubious advice on the Internet and starting to engage in self-medicating.
There are such citizens who begin taking anticoagulants for their own decision a week before their next appointment.

Our money is being spent on the construction of a cathedral on the site of a former quarry 20 million dollars
Sanchez, who found money in a church pew in Texas, pays taxes.
Crime Stoppers of Houston announced the case in a press release.
The incident occurred in a crowded cathedral in the city of Leeuwarden, where priest Joël Ostin is said to have delivered a sermon warning of the dangers of pride and growth.
In November 2021, the St. Petersburg Cathedral of St. John the Divine saw the collapse of one of the cathedral's towers, and discovered thousands of packages of money and change under the debris.
He handed over the key to the church and, according to his words, did not receive even gratitude from Ostarina.
I wanted to hear how he said it: 'Yeah, Dad, you did OK.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
According to all indications, the knot was caused by a fish, which occurred in the church of Leydvik a decade ago.
At that time, about 200 billion dollars in cash and 400 billion dollars in the form of checks were missing, which were kept in the cathedral safe.
The money was confiscated, so the cathedral did not make any savings.
Nevertheless, the information about the perpetrators was announced, comprising 25 billion dollars.
Zastin Kouli could not recommend the amount as he had already expired the grace period for the debt.
Despite this, non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, at one time allocating five million dollars in prizes and earning another 20 million dollars in donations from the crime lab at Lewicku, has decided to reinstate its integrity contest.
He will receive 20 billion dollars.
Earlier, it was reported that police asked the owner of the pub, Djoela Ostar, about money found in the lane of the Leicestershire church.

In China, a new case of human infection with the virus of bird flu has been confirmed
New case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) highly pathogenic strain has been confirmed in China.
This was reported by radio station RTHK with a link to a notification from the Hong Kong Organ Donation and Transplantation Service.
The 68-year-old resident of the urban area of the city of Huaychizhu in the southern province of Gannan was infected with the disease.
His condition is assessed as critical by medics.
The first case of human infection with the H5N6 subtype of the avian influenza virus in the world was recorded in May 2014 in the southern province of Sychuan.
There have been 53 such cases in the country.
In Bulgaria, citizens are required to declare their vaccination status when entering the country
In Barbados, it is mandatory for travellers entering the territory of the state to be vaccinated with a Covid vaccine, the appropriate decision was taken by the Supreme Court of Barbados (STF) Louis Roberge Barroux.
This was reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens have been freed from the detainment center after the release of their identification cards.
Also in the list of exceptions are people arriving from countries where there is a lack of vaccination.
The situation is even more serious if we take into account that Bulgaria is a popular destination for hosting new age, vintage and vintage weddings, as well as other events, which implies an increase in the number of tourists, noted Barrozu.
In the past, the authorities in Bosnia required unvaccinated travelers from coronavirus-infected countries to take a five-day quarantine.
Unveiled scheme to fully protect against Covid19
The virologist, doctor of medical sciences, academician of sciences of Russia, Anatoly Altshtein, in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of full protection against coronavirus infection.
According to his words, this can be achieved by introducing an infection and applying a local anaesthetic.
In the case of intranasal application, a large number of immunoglobulins are formed. When the vaccine is injected into the body, this does not occur.
Immunoglobulin A protects the lining of the respiratory tract, so the virus cannot penetrate the organ.
After vaccination, the largest amount of immunoglobulin G (antigen) is formed inside us.
And if you get both doses, you'll get a lot of antibodies to A and G. But until there's a decision on double vaccination," the doctor said.
Principal clinical psychologist at URO, Dr Sergey Torkarev, a medical scientist, also said that the main advantage of using a nasal spray together with an injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help ensure that the system is protected in such a case.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Moscow region, Dmitry Mikheyev, said that the new variant of the coronavirus will lead to the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.
According to his words, such a card is being observed in other countries, where pandemics have arrived earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I had a chat with my mate (I haven't talked to him in ages) about that - if you're prepared to change the dull house, carpet, lights, love and games into something lively, then go for it.

Voz has detected "immigration" in six dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the new strain of coronavirus, known as "Imicron", has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new variant could have catastrophic consequences.
The spread of the virus was described in a statement by the VOV.
According to data from the organization, on September 9, the virus had already been detected in 63 countries, in all six regions of the world.
This is because it has only been actively spreading since the end of November.
Voz also expressed concern about the spread of the new variant at a high temperature.
Experts at the WHO expressed concern that the new strain, based on preliminary data, could surpass the "delta" variant, the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries, with the exception of one.
Until now, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had stated that the flu virus could have a significant impact on the course of the pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the UK.
Experts from Lonsdale School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "infectious" will replace "endemic" in the next few months.
The number of those infected only in Bulgaria amounts to around one million. This is due to the fact that officially there are several hundred thousand people in the current moment in Korolev, but according to the estimates as many as ten million.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the swine flu virus "imicon", and more than two million people will be vaccinated in hospitals every day.
The British system of health care will struggle to cope.
The situation is complicated by the fact, according to recent studies, the efficacy of the vaccine developed by company Pfizer-BioNTech against the variant "Imikron" is 32 times lower compared to other variants of the disease.
It is not known how the Russian "Sputnik V" vaccine reacts to the "Imikron", but this will become clear in the next few days.
The center of the name Gamaliel only participated in the experiment of Russian vaccine on the hamster "Imicron".

According to director of Ivideon Products Company, Zurab Abubulatimova, the main danger related to the spread of video communication tools is the risk of scams.
In this case, a memorial video is created using the real recordings with the participation of the bereaved.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to reproduce the behaviour of any person to a high degree of accuracy.
Abucharimov added that scammers could call a victim using a spoofed number pretending to be a friend or create a role-playing game with the involvement of a copy of a person for the purpose of extortion.
"Such attachments can simply provoke blinding, as the venomous snake can place people in uncomfortable, dangerous or constricting situations," an expert said.
Systemic intruder Varonis Alexander Vetchkov also noted that psychologically people are more likely to trust others when they see them.
He pointed out that this could create specific risks when it comes to technologies that use video.

The reason for the decrease in self-confidence after working hard all day is often referred to as "migraine from a bad day." This is what an internationally renowned neurologist, a medical doctor and a member of the faculty of the Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of Munich, a clinical instructor at the Clinic of Systemic Medicine of Dr. Vladova, and a medical instructor at the Clinic of Systemic Medicine of Zuhair Pawlova told in their own podcast.
According to her words, especially those of those suffering from gallstones, which are often accompanied by bile ducts, liver and gallbladder problems.
Doctor Pavlova noted that in addition to the lingering effects of the hangover, there are enough objective reasons for a negative reaction of the body to changes in conditions.
Our lives are changing in a fundamental way.
"Sleep for a long time, and stay in bed all day, more likely to get more weight, and less likely to lose weight," the doctor argued. - Due to lack of coffee, a small bump starts to form.
Because of the transfer and shortage of water - tension and fragility."

Canclier Greece Sholtz: gas loses importance for FGR through 25 years
New head of the FPRG, Olaf Scholz, said that the import of gas is losing importance for Germany, as the country continues to move towards decarbonisation of its economy.
According to his words, Hungary plans to completely abandon coal, lignite and coke by 2045, becoming a carbon-neutral country.
That is, after 25 years the world will be such that the question of transporting goods to and from Russia and Europe will play a secondary role, said Kanzler.
Holtz noted that Hungary is continuing to insist that Ukraine transport Russian natural gas, even though at this point that resource is of critical importance for electricity transmission.
He recalled that Hungary and Slovakia had made a declaration, in which it was stated that Belarusian side supports energy transformation of Ukraine.
Earlier, the Minister of Defense of Georgia Annalena Berbo said that the process of certification of the gas pipeline "Southern Stream - 2" continues.
According to the ministry, within the framework of bilateral negotiations and discussions on a bilateral energy agreement, it was stated that the European right should be applied to energy projects.
Diplomat also said that the transit corridor "does not comply with the commitments" of the Eurasian Economic Union.

On the Referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third regatta, which was held on December 12, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the partial results announced on Friday, December 12, in the evening, most of the residents of New Caledonia voted in favour of independence during the referendum.
The level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results of the local elections published, 3.51% (2,755 people) of the people who voted spoke out in favour of de facto independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
Yavka made up 43.90% of the vote, and more than 80 thousand residents of New Caledonia took part in the selection.
Commenting on these provisional results, the agency France Presse said that "the choices made did not leave room for doubt," as foreign independent broadcasters were excluded from the vote.
As the initiators of the Referendum, they took part in its rejection on December 12, considering that the new variant of COVID-19 on the archipelago is a hindrance to conducting a full and "honest" referendum.
In this way, this participation opened the way to the third victory of the nearest rivals of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
As stated by the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and accuse them of fraud.
As reported on Thursday, December 12, in Elysee, President Emmanuel Macron is to make a statement on the results of this referendum.
Independence of New Caledonia has long been a source of tension between France and Australia.
Several candidates in the presidential race have said they want the territory to remain part of France as it is "the last region of the European Union in the Pacific Ocean".
New Cyprus must remain French," - has repeatedly said Eric Zemmour.
The same declaration was made by candidate from the Republic of Belarus Vali Pecherski, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October calling on Cardon to stay in France.
On the other hand, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not be taking a position, "because it is not his responsibility."
Still, the president added: "France would have been less beautiful without New Caledonia."
The Minister of the Interior, Jan Kasten, on the other hand, expressed a "strong desire that the choice of candidates should be a choice of France."
Hi there!
I am a little... a lot annoyed, really.
Thank you for not closing my channel.
On the topic: I'm not a bad artist, I can draw a heart, but it looks like a heart attack.
But as an artist - not at all an artist: what to change here?
But let's not forget that at one time there was a famine, so the expectation was not so widespread as it is today.
But the medicine was useless - pills, creams and lotions.
At the moment, I have a knot in my throat.
It's completely useless.
In Turkey, they experienced the world's first unmanned air vehicle with a laser weapon
In Turkey, successful trials of the first drone equipped with a laser weapon took place.
The BPL "Eren" was tested at distances of 100 to 500 meters, "MIR24" reports.
The device is able to detect dangerous objects at a distance by using laser.
The maximum height of the newt reaches 3 tons.
After the completion of the corresponding trials, the BPLA is expected to proceed to the procurement of turreted warships, which will be used to destroy intruding devices without involving the use of sails.
The agency points out that Turkey is one of six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drugs.

Readers of the Wall Street Journal criticized the article on relations between Russia and Slovakia
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized a column by professor Krystofera Hartley, in which he described his view of relations between Russia and Slovakia.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is treating Ukraine as a victim of Russia.
In his article, he assured readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and accepted a number of provocative statements in the address to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of the Cold War, after the fall of the Warsaw Pact, he urged the "lesser of two evils" against Russia.
Readers of the Wall Street Journal expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
In this article there is a lot of useless information," one of the readers commented.
Europe is not ours to "take" and Ukraine is not our land.
The Czech Republic and its NATO allies NEVER enter into a joint military operation with Russia around Ukraine," he noted.
Patches can also be applied to the gums.

Ukraine is starting to produce reactive single-dose vials of the new generation
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish port of Mariupol, they are starting to create reactive, bullet-proof vests (BVP) similar to ANKA.
This was announced by the Office of the President of Ukraine on November 11.
This means that they are capable of acting against harmful objects, and against other non-military objects.
Even against air attacks.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the turkish aircraft: the fuselage and suchlike," - quotes Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main characteristics of the ANKA equipment, Arestovich said that the talk is about reactive, not explosive, BPPs.
According to his words, this is a new generation of unmanned vehicles after Bayraktar that surpass him "by all characteristics".
The first party of the BPL should be held at the end of the next year, concluded Arestovich.
The lethal ANKA device was created by the Tula aerospace agency in February 2014.
The development of the unmanned vehicle was led by Turkey's military in collaboration with a number of private companies.
Ukrainian Gen. Stanislav Surov said the data on the use of Bayraktar and Javelin rocket systems during military operations in Donbas had been compiled.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky informed that construction of the wall to prepare modern non-commissioned officers has begun in the country.
According to his words, Ukraine is aiming to apply tariffs.
On September 29, the company Bayraktar Savunma and Ukrainian Minibands concluded an agreement on construction in the Kiev area centre, where personnel will be trained, as well as trials and commissioning of the turreted Bayraktar BMP.
The press service of the Ukrainian lawyer's office called this memorandum "a significant step forward".
Two luggage bags fell from the container at the airport
In Changi Airport in Singapore, there were heavy showers.
The Straits Times reports on this.
Two squid were successfully selected from the container with the family of lobsters, which arrived on one of the aircraft.
The publication notes that it is not known from which country they were taken into custody and where they were headed.
One of the dangerous ladders collapsed onto the cargo container.
Escape from him was impossible due to the established protective net.
The confrontation ended after the arrival of members of the organization Mandai Wildlife Group at the airport, who were accompanied by all of the Sinagpuri gorillas.
They dismantled the lorries using cranes and are planning to deliver them to a car crash site.
Earlier it was reported that in Pnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia, a left-handed woman fell from her husband and disrupted the streets of the city.
On the same day, he returned home peacefully, and people did not suffer.
Specialists warn of risk from vitamin B9 deficiency
Studies suggest that the breakdown of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to anemia.
The Daily Express warned of this.
According to specialists, there are weak evidence that people who do not suffer from a deficiency in folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dosage in the opposite direction contributes to the growth of reproductive cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietitian Bet Kitchin advises to keep an eye on the number of folic acid pills needed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of losing money is only increased in the case of significantly deviating from this number in either direction.
Kittin recommends not taking vitamins B9 in pills without a doctor's recommendation, always follow dosage instructions and avoid grape juice and other foods high in folic acid.
In the past, a consultant on nutrition, Rainee Faine, named a folic acid supplement a food supplement, which she said slows the aging process.
Since it is contained in avocado, Filet advised men to have this dish more often after the age of 50.
In the Balkan region, due to the ominous smog, around 75 million people may be affected
Prognoses for British schoolchildren suggest that because of the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, in the next five months in England, as many as 75 per cent of people could be infected if no restrictions are imposed on winter.
The Guardian newspaper reported on this with a link to a study by experts from LSHTM on genetics and prenatal diagnosis.
According to the most optimalistic forecast of specialists, who are part of the scientific and consultative group for exceptional situations at the British Cabinet of Ministers, by the end of 2022, not less than 25 million people will be registered in the country due to swine flu, and around 175 million patients will be hospitalized.
At the same time, the number of babies being vaccinated will increase to 2 million a day.
Serious measures to fight the coronavirus may need to be taken to prevent the national health service from being overwhelmed if asymptomatic spread becomes more common than the alternative of being told to self-isolate, mathematician Rossanda Barnard from LSHTM said.
Earlier, the Agency for Healthcare Safety and Quality in Victoria, Australia, informed that if the rate of spread of the ominous strain of haemorrhagic fever remains at a low level, about 1 million cases of infection will be reported at the end of the year.
At the same time, in mid-December, the storm may become a dominating force in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, in Bulgaria, there are 1898 cases of infection with the respiratory syncytial virus, of which 633 were confirmed in the last few days.
At the same time, on 9 December, the head of the British branch of the International Monetary Fund, Sadiq Javid, said that in reality, this indicator may already reach 10 cases.

Request for superyachts has surged in the world
Construction superheats in this year and orders for next year are breaking all records around the world, no matter how many calls are made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight against climate change.
In the world record book, the number of horses ordered was 1,200 - a quarter more than in the previous year.
In the fight against the consequences of climate change, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a flying car will not decrease, writes "Gardian".
But it becomes more.
This year, orders were 25% higher than last year.
Brokers say it has not happened on the London market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many, who can allow themselves to be haunted, are fearful of attacks on their soul and prefer to hide from pan-demonic attacks on their own body.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If these people used to walk into an office and bump into partners on business, now a vast majority of them work remotely, and meetings are conducted via video conferencing.
Broker Iliy Krysta told the gazette that Versace are taking bookings for new yachts in 2025 and later.
This means that customers are prepared to pay more just to have their orders ready by the time they arrive.
People just want freedom, and the super-rich can help you get it, he says.
In the western community, many criticize such behavior and call it degenerate.
Godless people, according to sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of scarcity, wandering in the streets, living on the roofs or flying on their own aircrafts can provoke indignation in the community, because the elite does not want to share responsibility for the change in the climate with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and propose new taxes and rules for super-rich individuals, though they understand it will be very difficult to implement such a mobility.
Between the two, it only prints the number of requested supersets, but their characteristics.

The superstructures of the existing skyscrapers have been converted into platforms for rooftop gyms, cinemas under open domes, and on some of them, such as on the roof of the MacGregor building, a platform for a one-bedroom apartment. Professor of Economic Anthropology at the American University in India, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the average number of ballot boxes per person, cardboard ballot boxes, produced by supermarkets, are trivial.
But it has symbolic significance if we remember that there are a few thousand multimillionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overuse of a very small group of people.
Students found that the amount of microplastics in the seawater was thousands of times higher than that of the average seawater planet.

Even if the owner of the bottle is not there, the command continues to send the planet.

Owners of supercars do not provoke sympathy from other people, when they, as the most beautiful woman in Australia, Daniya Raynchard, the ruler of hairstyles on the Continent, complain through YouTube that for their genitalia there is no place for praises.
It is also difficult to understand the call to build a marina for yachts with a length of 50 meters.
It has been determined that the dangerous day of the year for the development of intestinal cancer
American students determined how much sugar-sweetened beverages increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
The Daily Express is writing about it.
Specialists came to the conclusion that the use of four or more portions of processed meat a day is linked to an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.
This means that the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in the amount of used saliva.
More than that, men who smoke heavily are at a higher risk of developing bladder cancer than women.
It is not possible to determine the exact cause of the development of such a type of oncology in children, noting only that certain factors lead to the growth of tumors for the organism.

Ukraine prepares for war with Russia and China
Ukraine and Russia will "argue" about Ukraine's inclusion in the Nato, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for the "Glavreda" newspaper.
According to him, Vienna and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations in the near future on guarantees for the Union of Soviet States in relation to Ukraine's non-entry into the Eurasian Economic Union, despite the words of US diplomat John Baiden on the right of countries "to go where they like."
If you are offered something that is inherently unacceptable, for example, selling your close relative into sexual slavery, you will not be trading, but simply walking away from the proposal.
In relation to Ukraine, the analyst wrote, "there is a trade."
Kochetkov added that Russia is not planning to attack Ukraine, but is striving for dialogue with Kiev.
Preparation is being carried out secretly, quickly and immediately transitioning to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the group to be discovered and then unleashing force against it, he noted.
Kazakhstan stimulates development of inland waterway transport
Upcoming Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the Czech Republic, Hungary, France and other countries to the International Logistics and Manufacturing Exhibition of China 2021, which is being held in the city of Zhuzhuo, the province of Hunan / Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, noted representative of the company Hao Ch'ao Wen.
High-speed trains, travelling on the electrified line between Beijing and Moscow, which was put into operation at the start of this month, have already been equipped with technology that provides increased safety and reliability for the vulnerable components.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its export of liquefied natural gas vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are becoming witnesses to "China's speed".
This year, with the production line of the company CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd, the first two-seated high-speed electric locomotives developed in China were shipped to Europe for export.
At the maximum working speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will be cruising along glassy roads in Italy, Greece, Bulgaria and other European countries.
In November, a trial run of the Metro, developed by the company mentioned above for tourism, began.
The train will move along the MetroPlus line, connecting the city center of St. Petersburg with the airport.
The line will be opened to traffic next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 km/h.
"Korean industry in the production of equipment for subsea transport is one of the leading sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international competitive potential," said Fen Youshan, vice president of the investment department of the Korean Committee for the Development of International Trade /KKCT/.
This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese manufacturing on the world market, said Fang Youshan.
After more than 60 years of closely working, conducting a series of independent studies and developments, China has established a preparatory system for the production of equipment for liquefied natural gas transportation, with a complete set of auxiliary means and a large machining industrial activity.
According to the words of Fen Youshan, the country occupies the first place in the level of electrification of steel rails and in the development of high and urban steel rails.
Biologist describes early signs of human evolution
In the shadow of Sputnik, the first satellite in space, scientist Semyon Gorshkov counted the early signs of humanity.

The neurosurgeon needed to send the patient to the hospital for treatment
Former Prime Minister of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili is in need of psychotherapeutic treatment and rehabilitation, declared journalist Otar Toidzé, who is attending the Congress of Neurologists, created in exchange for Georgia.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading cause of his illness.
The most stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, and changing characteristics," the specialist said, noting that this does not fall outside the normal range and now the governor needs to be sent on a special rehabilitation.
This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychosocial rehabilitation, but we did not find it possible in Gaza, noted Tofide, who stressed the need for Saraka to be treated in a specialised unit, which does not exist in Gaza.
In the evening of December 7, Sakashvili started to receive medical assistance after his colleagues at the psychiatric service subjected him to a diagnostic examination.

In India, tests against COVID-19
In Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, actions of protest against compulsory vaccination against COVID-19 passed, the agency Europa Press reports.
In the Katarsk district, the number of participants in the action amounted to approximately 3 thousand people.
In bars, restaurants, sports halls, and homes of the elderly and night owls, Covid wards became mandatory.
Many of the manifestos arrived without masks.
The loons on their lawns blamed the government for the polarization and called for citizens to respect their choice.
In Venezuela, passport control is also required for entering segregated accommodation and restaurants, with capacity of more than 50 people.
Those protesting in the city said they were protesting against medical malpractice, while activists dubbed the vaccination an experiment.
In Italy, with the start of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of infection with the coronavirus were detected, and more than 88,000 patients died.
In Russia, restrictions for unvaccinated people are also planned.
On December 12, the government passed a bill on a single QR code system.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places for holding mass events, cultural institutions, objects of public catering and recreational facilities with a declaration or a certificate of vaccination or a certificate of exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will apply to trains and airplanes.

The Curious Pound: How Chinese Become Gourmets
Olimpic Games is expected to attract millions of people and help create a global standard in cycling in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million people to participate in winter sports of various forms, but also encourage the designated president of Sichuan province, Si Zhenlin, to collect 1 billion yuan in donations.
Horse-riding courses in Zhanjzhouu, located not far from the place where Winter Olympic Games ice skating events are being held, are becoming more popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, work is also being carried out on landscaping. Workers are laying trees.
In the country there are more than 700 mountain gorillas, but only 20 of them are sufficiently large to take part in international agreements.
In many regions of China, where there are coral reefs, including in Zhanjiang, there are problems with ice.
The main task for the long-distance perspective - to ensure comfortable and interesting stay on the Korean beaches, so that all newcomers would always feel welcome.
However, it's still far away.
Secretary General of the Games Organizing Committee, Djastin Danius, said that the last time he visited China in 2007, Taiwan's low-cost industry had changed into an unknown industry.
Every year, thousands of Chinese are sent down the slopes during the winter.
Fiona, snorkeling from the Peninsula, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will still take many more years to create a vibrant culture here, Dunns believes.
Many corsets are found in rural and urban areas.
These regions still need to actively develop and create the infrastructure needed for a holiday destination.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Kunli, not far from the place where the Winter Olympic Games were held.

China is aiming to create a growing industry of winter sports, its sportsmen should become leaders of the largest international teams, and curlers and equipment - to achieve world-class standards.
More than 500 million people in the world could be facing the worst poverty due to pandemics, declared in the World Bank
More than 500 million people around the world could be plunged into extreme poverty as a result of the pandemic, which has stalled progress towards universal access to health services, the WHO and the World Bank said.
In connection with the marked 12 December, International Day of Access to Health Services, the World Health Organization and the World Bank published two complementary documents.
In them they established that pancreatitis led to complications in the performance of endoscopic procedures, resulting in intraluminal pressure in the gastrointestinal tract.
In this connection, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of population immunization has been reduced, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has risen.
In the VOEZ and VBP they pointed out that pandemics caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment."
This situation is hitting more than 500 million people in "poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets."
In October, the General Secretary of the O.N.U. Antnio Guterres said that pandemics of the coronavirus had led to the death of more than 100 million people, and more than four billion people practically do not have social support.

Reuters: Taimanovsk's Minister of the Interior disconnected from the transmission on "Self-Made Democracy" by request of White House
Ministry of Digital Technologies of Tajikistan's participation in panel discussion during the organized "Summit for Democracy" was translated into a mode without video, according to the recording of the summit on YouTube.
The agency Reuters, with a link to its sources, confirmed that the picture was disabled by a request from White House.
According to their message, the reason for the incident was a map on which Taitung was drawn as a separate colour from CNR, deeming the island its territory.
The map, which was shown to the Pope by TAN, was compiled by the civil society organization CIVICUS and ranked countries on their level of guarantee of civil rights.
Taiman was marked as "freedom" green, while KNR, KNDR, Laos and Vientiane were marked as "closed."
After the minister showed the map, the picture of her side was replaced with a screenshot with the comment that the views of participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the government of the Czech Republic."
The CNR was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Sources from Reuters point out that the map, which was demonstrated by Thai Minister of Foreign Affairs, could go against the policy of "one China" which is supported by Taiwan.
One of the sources of the agency claimed that after the demonstration, the card of the Soviet National Security Service was linked to the diplomat, accusing him of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Organized Voting "Timeline for Democracy" passed from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and nongovernmental organizations.
Russia did not invite.

Cosmic capsule New Shepard with six tourists on board completed suborbital flight
On the evening of the 11th of December, a suborbital flight was conducted by the company Blue Origin, with its New Shepard capsule carrying six astronauts.
The journey, which was posted on the company's website, lasted more than 10 minutes in total, after which the capsule with the passengers passed through the atmosphere, TASS reported.
Launch of the rocket was carried out from the spacecraft in the vicinity of the American city of Van Horn (state of Texas).
The ship rose slightly more than 100 meters, and the cosmonauts were in a comfortable state.
The rocket's attitude control system worked smoothly to trim the attitude of the spacecraft.
On July 20, the company Blue Origin successfully carried out the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard capsule with passengers on board.

China tightens epidemic prevention and control of COVID-19 in cities with densely populated areas, where there are numerous hotspots
The joint mechanism for the prevention and control of the National Council of the Russian Federation has released a circular requiring to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic of COVID-19 in cities where there are numerous vulnerable points, in order to further prevent the spread of infection due to the virus.
According to the calculator, people who have been to the cities mentioned should provide a negative result on a nucleic acid test for COVID-19, obtained within 48 hours of departure.
Those arriving in cities with densely populated pockets of poverty should give at least one test for asymptomatic COVID-19 at their arrival.
The document states that these requirements will come into effect on the day that the corresponding administrative units determine and publish the areas of the cities mentioned, as far as 15 March 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with densely populated areas that have been exempted from the ban and that meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for profiling and controlling the spread of COVID-19 within their jurisdiction.

In the MID, they spoke of a "significant conclusion" in relations between Russia and Slovakia
Interview with MI D Russia Sergey Riabkov in the Interfax news agency assessed prospects for relations between Moscow and Yekaterinburg.
He noted that a long-standing pattern of interaction had led to stark conclusions, and problems between the two countries had started not yesterday.
There is one-sided negativity in the negative forecast, but in terms of improving relations, all is completely unpredictable.
This is a printout of the results of the long journey, which we have passed through and with the new administration, and with Tramp and Obamacare.
The problems started not yesterday," he said.
According to Riabkov, the problems are related to the tendency of the US to link Russia to a number of questions.
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) added that it was not risk averse about providing optimistic forecasts on prospects for improving relations and did not expect to change the balance of power.
He explained that aside from such directions as strategic stability and cyber security, progress is not being monitored.
At the same time, Russia is calling on the United States to adopt a responsible approach to issues of international security and hopes that signals will be heard, and Americans will listen to the arguments of a responsible meaning.
Earlier this week, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Lavrov expressed Moscow's readiness to restore dialogue with Slovakia.
The infectious disease specialist warned about the danger of acquiring the virus from the previous patient outside the hospital
Those recovering from Covid-19 may develop allergies and need medical care, so it is not advisable to organise the first dose of the vaccine in airports and shopping centres.
This was reported by TASS virusologist, member of the Board of Directors of the RAN Biological Technologies, Microbiology and Virology Department of the Novosibirsk State University Sergei Nesterov.
It is easier to organise points of injection for the previous injection in airports and commercial centres, but I would only do this in medical establishments at the first few stages.
The problem is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small, but desirable for a person to live close to the cabinet where the vaccine is kept.
For patients, there are special collections of painkillers that act literally in two minutes, which is sometimes very useful," said Nesterov.
According to the virologist, it may be possible to think about vaccination in trading centres when there is experience in using the vaccine.
He also pointed out that it is important when using an anterior vaginal pack that it fits snugly on the pelvic floor.
Meanwhile, there is a chance that the vaccine will not reach its intended destination if the adjuvant is injected after the vaccine is administered.

Serbia produced 2 million doses of vaccine "Sputnik V"
Vakcina "Spunkt V" is most popular in Serbia.
Serbia produced about two million doses of Russian vaccine "Sputnik V", said TASS minister of innovations and technological development of the country, Nad Pappo.
In the state institute of Torlak, about 2 million vials of vaccine "Sputnik V" have been produced up to now, and we expect that in the coming period they will be produced at least 4 million, Popovich stated.
According to him, Russian vodka is the most popular among Serbs.
As a result of this, the republic plans to carry out additional mass vaccination of millions of people in Russia.
Minister of Innovations and Technological Development of Serbia also expressed his interest in the production in the territory of the state of the previous vaccine "Spiknik V" and the drug "Spiknik Light".
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said that Russia has placed nearly two million doses of vaccine against coronavirus disease "Sputnik V" in Serbia.

In the UK, 1239 cases of infection with the new coronavirus were confirmed over the past week.
Sky News reports on this.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of salmonella "Omikron" have been recorded in England, 38 people have been infected with a new variant of the infection in Scotland and five - in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with COVID-19 from the new variant in the UK has reached 3137.
In the past, students from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine calculated that in England, as a result of the spread of the coronavirus, triggered by the "immigrant virus", 75 million people could be infected.
The singer warned of the suffering of the countries of the South, which are being subjected to anti-Russian sanctions
President of Russia Dmitry Peshkov has approved the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "encroachment" on the territory of the country.
Official representative of Kremla, Evgeny Tikhomirov, said in an interview with radio station “Rossiya 1”: “It is impossible to impose some restrictions on Russia and not suffer any consequences.”
The song confirms that "everyone in the world" understands it.
Earlier, it was reported that Russia is considering introducing antirussian sanctions into the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank are planning to introduce restrictions aimed at slowing down the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and Russian government bonds.
At the same time, the head of the European Central Bank, Herman Gref, is convinced that this is impossible.

New Caledonia residents reject independence from France
According to the final results of the third Referendum on Independence of New Caledonia, which satisfied the majority of participants, they refused to leave France.
This was announced by French television channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% voted against independence.
They supported independence from France of 3.51% of the population of the archipelago in the Aegean Sea.
The result was 2.99 percent.
The level of participation in the vote this day was very low: just over 55% of the archipelago's residents took part.
According to experts, low turnout is explained by appeals from Separatists to withdraw from the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to move the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia spoke out against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum was held on the issue of independence in the region.
Most residents supported the inclusion of the archipelago in the composition of France.
New Cyprus is almost 20 km from the French mainland.
In 1853 France declared New Caledonia to be its colony.
The archipelago is home to around 270,000 people, and the territory enjoys a special administrative-territorial status.
Between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia there is a 1998 agreement according to which the region can organise a referendum on its independence twice with a difference of two years.

Voz considers'microbe' less dangerous than 'delite'
The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously said that "immunosuppression" is less dangerous than the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
In addition, there are data on the reduction of the effectiveness of the vaccine in the case of infection with the new variant of COVID-19.
According to information on September 9, "omikron" has been registered in 63 countries.
Previous data and a significantly altered anti-viral profile of the white blood cell "micron" allow us to assume a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transmission of variants.
According to preliminary findings from the UAR technical report, it is suggested that ("strength of illness" - rd) may be less severe than during a "double" - it is said in the technical communication from VOO.
The organization points out that as long as all registered cases of violence against women in the EU are "amicably" resolved, it will be easy or seamless.
Along with that, a new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading more quickly.
In Russia, two cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have been registered.
They were "humiliated in the past," the Center for the Name of Gabriel said.

Four plays for Kiev
Eks-deputy Prime Minister of the Upper House Vadim Denisko listed four possible scenarios for the development of events for President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
According to him, the government can stay without support from the south, and also, possibly, go to a commission for Donbas.
On this day, December 12, Denisenko told the publication on the portals "Glavreda".
The first option, which Denisenko dubbed the "ideal" scenario, envisages Ukraine being stopped from supporting key eastern countries, reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to deepening the crisis with which Kiev will have to deal in 2023.
"Simultaneously, there is a reduction in the price of key goods that we traditionally export (… internal probes and resistance to power with key FPGs (financially-profitable groups)." - added the executive.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This scenario is likely to disappear in the case of a high level of volatility in world politics, at which point the Ukrainian authorities will be confronted with a series of problems.
As a result of such a position, Ukraine's leadership may go on to make concessions to Donbass, resulting in internal opposition within the country.
At the end of the season, the position of Zelenski is weakened, and the probability of such a situation, according to the words of the previous ruler, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics - confrontation of the population of the Donbass and the President, which is likely to lead to the seizure of control over the strategic block and the implementation of "pollution initiatives".
In the course of such a variant of the crisis, Zelensky will start "transforming the regime," added Denisenko.
Another scenario - the transformation of Zelenka into an "overseer".
This may lead to a certain event that will become a strong impetus for the community.
The event should be sufficiently scalable to trigger a reaction among external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine, said Denisenko.
Such a development of the situation is possible as a result of pathetic behavior, technogenic catastrophe or aggressive actions of Russia, the ex-deputy said.
At the same time, the Russian side has already rejected any possibility of "attack" on Ukraine once again.
In Moscow, it was noted that precisely Ukrainian vassal states, NATO and Ukraine are increasing military activity on Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of Ukrainian President plummeted to a low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest point in the selection of its main government.
Analysts predicted that in the case of upcoming elections, the president of Ukraine would delegate his vote to Zelensky by a margin of 21.8 percent, while the head of the country, Petro Poroshenko, would receive 14.5 percent.
Among all the candidates, only 19.3% expressed support for the presidency.

Arrested at the action on the Red Square: "For the quote from Evtushenko, 10 hours of work!"
At the beginning of the night, the 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was exhausted.
Student VSH was detained on the Red Square with a placard calling for an end to corruption, on which was written the hashtag #Поэтвроссибольшечемпоэт.
This is a quote from writer Eugene Evtushenko.
On Alexander, a protocol was drawn up on administrative matters relating to the repeated violation of the order of the conduct of public actions.
He was detained for the first time on 23 January on Pushkin Square, in support of Alexei Navalny.
The goal was to attract attention to poetry as a whole, but sadly, interest in it has waned, the culture has degenerated, and there is little hope of reviving obscure poets, writes Alexander.
We linked up with the young man to find out more about the delay and get a more detailed breakdown of the reasons for the delay.
How did police officers communicate with you when you were detained this time and in the past?
What did you ask separately, and how did you comment on your activity?
This time the staff were more correct, the delay was maximum, the service was very slow, as if they were trying to make up for lost time.
On Pushkin's grave, flowers and bricks were thrown.
They asked about motivations.
When you hear, in principle, you look if it's not offensive, then it's understandable.
Excluding the live feed, everything was pretty much correct, but I knew what I was looking at.
And if after the action people start writing their diaries under that hashtag, at least a few people, I won't waste those 10 hours.
According to the protocol, Maxim should be able to communicate in the language of the people he is visiting.
At public and official events, they speak the language of the surrounding countries to make sure everyone understands what happened in Bundiestage 25 September 2001, or in the native language through a translator.
This protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks perfectly Russian and still appeals to the translator.
And at official events, stick grammars are being used to teach proper etiquette, and stenography is not required to know several languages.

Lost film, lord film and other pirates removed from award "Indecis"
Candidates for launch
In 2015, rightsholders from the collective "RAEK/Media" compiled a list of 100 most popular Russian-language websites, and most of them ceased to exist, says director of the Institute for Internet Research Karin Kazarin.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - managed to survive thanks to including a regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in search results as "Yandex" and Google, you can look at the Russian-language copies of the Netflix series "Play in the Carribean" and "Night of the Iguana" - original series of the biggest Russian video service ivi (included in AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also searchable by keyword, you can watch the animated newcomer "Ein Kino" but, judging by the quality of the video, this is what is known as an anamorphic screen (removed from the cinema print of the film).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, is available a serial called "Universe. 10 years later" (part of "Gazprom media").

Estonian students will search for life on Venus
Masachusetski Institute of Technological Research, in collaboration with Taruski Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three cosmic missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, "Actual Camera" reported on Thursday.
The goal of the mission - to assess the suitability of asteroids for life and then search for life there.
For the project, they proposed instruments for measuring the calcium content and the content of calcium oxides in the areas of the vertebrae.
Previously, it was assumed that the Venerian sector, closest to the planet Venus, was too corrosive for life to exist, but likely Venus was originally a planet of the dark type.
During the third mission, the probe is expected to arrive at Venus.
Assuming we find life there, the main question will be - is it similar to Earth or different?
If they are very similar, it will be obvious that life on Earth did not start on Earth.
If it differs, the more likely it is that life began on Earth," said project leader of the "Venus Life Finder" Estonia team Mikkel Paulsalu.

Metamorphic changes in Russian business
The topic of fake news has become a popular topic this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the conversion of Facebook into Meta.
For retail this event became a significant signal: the biggest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in creating its own metadata and its subsequent monetization.
Metaphorical language is to be considered as a continuation of the existing trends.
On the one hand, the triangle for creating interpersonal interactions in conditions of pandemics, because people stopped from division and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is the consequence of businesses striving to develop eco-systems and adapt operational models to them.
The third - they are logical continuations of the trend of digitizing assets, when all rights, precious metals, works of art, and even money transition into a digital format.
Ania, you're right, changing eating habits is a conscious process.

British economist unable to predict 2022
British economist Dzim O'Nilll was unable to give a prediction for 2022 as he believes such attempts are fraught with danger.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be an unpredictable one and any tendency can change the noun.
The most important factor remained the pandemic of coronavirus, and the second - information, he said.
O'Nill also admitted he does not know if the increase in prices is temporary or permanent.
As a specialist indicated, it was clear before pandemics that "financial hubs around the world were already feeling the pinch" and it was time to return to relationships where percentage rates would align with expected growth in VVP.
O'Niil noted that, on the back of pandemics, continuation of a profligate economic policy could lead to a new information crisis, according to some experts.
In addition, attention should be paid to the question of productivity growth, as well as the increase in poverty and the change in the size of the population, O'Neil concluded.
Earlier this week, analysts at global research firm "Opening Investments" reported that positive expectations for the dollar's course in 2022 remain intact, while the potential for growth will be less significant.
Among the risks for the course of the dollar, he listed financial policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of the price of gold and the dangers of pandemics.
You must agree.

Russia has delivered around 4.5% of the world's vaccine doses
According to statistical data from the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency (NPI), Russia's car owners spent 2.7 trillion rubles on new cars in the first 10 months of 2021, an increase of 28% over the same period last year.
To understand the scale - about the same amount (around $3 trillion) was spent by the government on supporting citizens and the economy during the pandemic.
In September, on the sidelines of the Shangai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, President Vladimir Putin of Russia said that such a sum is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's GDP by 2020.
By sales on the Russian market, Korean brand Kia dominates.
For 10 months this year, he has been able to realize cars at a total cost of RUB325.7 million, which is almost 24% higher than the same period last year.
Kia, the sibling brand to Hyundai, has seen a bigger increase - by 35 per cent, and its sales of vehicles amounted to RUB 279.3 million.
At leading positions, this brand and the increase in the average price of automobiles - it has risen by almost 21% a year, to 1.94 billion rubles - the dynamics of growth was strongest only for Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes Benz.
At the same time, the volume of sales of Korean brands increased by only a small amount: according to statistics from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers in Europe, Kia sold 9.4% more vehicles during the same period than it did a year ago.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
The leader of the pack in terms of sales in nominal terms is Japanese Toyota - in Russia they spent 275.5 million rubles on cars of this brand over the past 10 months, which is 14 per cent more than a year ago.
For Japanese cars, Mercedes-Benz, with a sales volume of 266.1 million rubles (+75%), was the best performer, with a sales volume (37 percent) and average selling price (nearly 28 percent, up to 8.2 million rubles).
At the same time, Mercedes Benz is witnessing a good rise in sales and average price - more, for example, than BMW - which is leading to a bigger profit margin, explained Nikolai Arhabadze, director of NAPPI. -
According to the data, the sales of fantasy products have demonstrated the growth of the Chinese market, as well as significantly increasing financial efficiency this year."
Russian Lada demonstrates moderate growth in profitability (plus 28%) on vehicles of this brand in Russia, where the company has spent over 10 months 229.4 million rubles on cars.
At the level of financial performance last year, companies are found that have seen their sales of vehicles decline in 2021; specifically, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and all in minuses - for the past 10 months Russia has spent 12 rubles on imports and 12.4 rubles on exports of this brand against 12.4 rubles a year ago.
In the face of problems with the supply of auto components and assembly lines in production, automakers are continuing to adjust prices - the same "AutoVaz" has increased the cost of models Lada by a factor of six per year, the latest subsidy (at 8-10 thousand rubles) came at the end of November.
They regularly rewrite the price tags on their products and other automakers.
Vehicle sales in Russia in nominal terms will increase and continue - in addition to the deduction of the cost of the vehicle itself, the information also indicates that automakers are inclined to compensate for past losses, experts believe.
Under the conditions of the deduction of automobiles, I think that many auto insurance companies could even have been able to deduct the depreciation of the previous periods, which they could not deduct from the price of automobiles before.
Analyst " ВТБ Капитала " talks about the car crash of Vladimir Bespalov. -
I think automakers are feeling pretty good in financial terms right now, supporting high margins in sales," he said.
According to the expert, the main indicator of this is the pace of growth in the cost of cars, which will be monitored in 2021. Prices for new cars are growing faster, he adds.
In the long term, the market will be saturated, and in the short term, in terms of volume, and in terms of money, but mainly due to information and complexity of construction of individual machines, predicts Bespalov.
With the growth of the proposal, the possibilities for increasing the price will be limited.
In the current financial expression, Russian authors continue to grow, and in the coming year, even if the growth in the cost of automobiles slows down, automakers will be able to obtain their income from the volume of sales, independent consultant Sergei Burgalziev noted.
Considering the increased demand and insufficient proposal, automakers are now striving to obtain the highest profit from each sold car, Burgalziev noted. -
The volume of production of machines is not expected to increase at least in the next few months, and in Russia, as well as in the rest of the world, there is still uncertainty about the future.
In the face of a complicated situation on the market, cars turned out to be a good object for investments - a car bought a year ago, even with a profit, is now being sold at its original price, an expert says.
Bayden spoke out about the possibility of sending Russian troops to Ukraine in the event of Russia's secondment
The SSC never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the case of "encirclement" of Russia.
Such a declaration was made by the President of the Czech Republic, Václav Klaus.
There have never been such plans, said White House spokeswoman, responding to a reporter's question about whether the US had rejected such an idea.
Bayden noted that, in the event of an evacuation, Russia would be faced with economic consequences around Ukraine.
At the same time, he underlined that there are no obligations for the SAA and Nato to apply military force to protect Ukraine in case of an invasion.
American leader also said that the possibility of applying American troops in a one-sided order for the defense of Ukraine is not worth it.
Bayden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine's territory, the SEE countries would use their power in the East European countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
We will have to send more American and South Korean troops to the eastern front, B9 - all those countries NA-TO, for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia," said Baiden.
Earlier, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev underscored that Moscow lacks the will to resolve the conflict over Ukraine's territory.
He also said that Moscow sees a problem with the use of force by Kiev to impose the curfew, as well as the fact that "American intervention is getting closer to our territory."
