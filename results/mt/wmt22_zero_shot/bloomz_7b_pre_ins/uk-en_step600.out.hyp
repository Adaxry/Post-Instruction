It gets better - I am getting better, I am getting stronger.
If that fails, we will have a worse position.
They (scavengers) - people who have accumulated a great deal of garbage on themselves.
As our position in Mariupol weakens, our position will become more precarious, in the OMON district, and if they become more brutal, then the stakes will be higher for us and we will have more leverage with Russia's government.
If the situation is bad in all of these areas, then we may not be able to do much about it.
That is why Russia will have to make all these knots, which may lead to a reversal even in these mines, which we are currently digging.

Sergei Sidorenko: Our participation in Nato has stopped being distant prospect
For nine months, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against the entry into Nato and only 18% of those in favour.
After the Revolution of Independence, after the death of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the start of the war in Donbass, the number of opponents of the Nato started to fall, and the number of allies, attacks, surprises.
After the start of the pandemic, the relationship between Russia and Ukraine was marked by discord, and the level of control over Ukraine‚Äôs internal affairs was reduced to the level of a mere subordinate state ‚Äì to the tune of 75%.
Criticizing Ukraine's involvement in Nato and urging that Nato help Ukraine to meet its obligations under the pact, now there is a lot of criticism for the Alliance and its member states ‚Äì for a lack of transparency, for not being able to close the sky, for fear of "destroying" Russia.
In addition, there is a big risk that Ukraine will be humiliated by losing membership in the Alliance through a position of Russia, if this is possible to capture. Ukraine, on the other hand, receives the most generous guarantee, including that of Russia.
In the new episode of the podcast "Question of the Day", the editor of "EurAsian Rights" spoke to us about just that - how Ukraine has been supporting Armenia since the Russian annexation of Crimea, why Nato should criticise it and why Armenia should criticise it diplomatically, why our perspective of membership in Nato is closer than ever, as it has never been in its history, and why confidence-building measures with Russia, which are being negotiated, are crucial.

International diplomacy has been trying to defuse the crisis and defund the sanctions after evidence emerged that Russian troops had interfered in Ukraine's civil war, while Moscow has denied this as a "provocation."
The notification about the dead, missing and critically injured Russian citizens of Ukrainian origin, who were shot and killed in Volhynia, has been sent, the Deputy Minister of the Interior of Novaya Zemlya Djasinda Arderne told reporters in Velynogtoni on April 4.
Russia must answer for what they did to us before the war," she added, indicating that her delegation will discuss additional sanctions to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.
Deputy Prime Minister of Japan Taro Aso called the names of the individuals involved in the "violation of international law".
The cries of the protesters were drowned out after the announcement of the deaths of six million people in the world.
The photos, on which the bloodied hands of a man and a woman are visible, shook the internet and sparked outrage, prompting calls for their arrest and questioning.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on Thursday that the Russian annexation of Crimea was a sign that the Russian oligarchs had ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù Ukraine.
What happened in Bucharest is a new round of sanctions and even more punitive tariffs, said Macron, adding that punitive tariffs must be compensated for by Russian exports of goods and services.
Spanish Minister of the Interior, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, said Russian border guards could go as far as chasing "genocidal" foxes into Bucharest.
We need to do everything we can to ensure that those responsible for these atrocities do not go unpunished," said S√°nchez in Madri.
As she was getting off the subway at the central station, Ms. Marya Zharova, a spokeswoman for the Moscow Mayor's administration, used the word "scam."
Without any evidence, she claimed that the Skripal and Navalny "covered" the image in order to discredit Russia.
In this case, I think, the fact that these statements were made in the first hours after the appearance of these materials, does not depend on the guilt or innocence of those who made these statements, ‚Äì said Zharova.
Earlier this month, Minority Report Russia also claimed without evidence that the image of the bullet was "just one more piece of evidence of the Russian regime" and that all Russian journalists had left the city by the 30th.
Moscow asked Ryad to reduce its oil production by 4 million barrels a day to talk to them about calling it a "safeguard" for Russian oil prices.
The Committee of Concerned Russians issued a statement applauding the resolution, in which they voted in favor of ‚Äúpunishing‚Äù Russia for its interference in Ukraine‚Äôs ‚Äúillegal activities.‚Äù
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived at 3 p.m., saluting the Russian flag in the square, and telling the crowd that he had come to invite them to Bucharest to celebrate their victory.
I want to make it clear that all the cheetahs in the Russian Federation are doing well," - said Zelenski in the video conference, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
It is complementary.
For the attacks, for the murders... For the murders in the pipeline," he said.
He said that President of Russia Vladimir Putin and Russian officials should not interfere in the internal affairs of Ukraine.
I don't understand how many people there are with their hands tied and their throats slit, he said about the stabbings on the streets of Bucharest, close to 35 kilometers from Kiev.
Co-respondent of the Ukrainian Service for Freedom Radyo Svoboda 2 confiscated a large amount of drugs in the streets of Kiev.
Only one respondent knocked on the door at 10 o'clock.
The AP news agency reported that at least 21 people were killed in different locations in Baku.
One of the two groups of nine people - all in wheelchairs - were escorted onto the ground floor of the building, where, according to the words of the disabled citizens, they used Russian silks as a base.
The same, but in English.
The governor of the Ukrainian region of Kiev stated that at least 410 people had been killed in the region, and that it had been controlled by Russian forces until late last night.
I'm sorry, everything is fine, I bought everything on the list.
They said to me, ‚ÄòKiev is dead‚Äô. The Ukrainians deported to Russia and Belarus
Russia's second visit to Ukraine has been met with horrific rhetoric, including graffiti, vandalism, arson, and catcalls.
There is one more point in this list, but it has little in the way of information - the decline of the indigenous population in the area.
Close to the mid-point of the border with Russia, the Ukrainians "evacuated" from the ethnically cleansed points near their own territory and the territory of Belarus, which was practically annexed by the Russian Federation.
Ukrainian law, on the other hand, stipulates that a child born out of wedlock has the same rights as a child born into wedlock.
The text of this article has been translated from Ukrainian to English.
In the wild, they live and reproduce in pairs.
In the east, looking at the declarations of the Ukrainian authorities, the roar of the crowd was drowned out in Russia and Belarus with a heavy baton.
Such was the case with Melitopol, where the Russians lined up the other side of the pologovian border, demanding tribute without bishops, among them twelve-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of Kiev-bred Hetman Ukraine.
The name of Alexander, Mary and their 10-year-old son Valy had been searched for by the host family for many miles.
Alexander just received a helicopter in the aerodrome "Antonov", which is 2.5 km from the station.
The mother of the child died in a traffic accident on the territory of the village of Vysokov, she wanted it to be natural.
As for the authenticity of the plaster, Danius and Marina had their doubts about the three-figure bills, but the 24th of July was too close to call.
No one was injured in the accident, and the driver of the car was unhurt.
Nearly 12 years ago, on the 24th of August, they performed the first heart transplant from a Latin language donor to a patient.
One of them killed in a crossfire.
The mother took her child in her arms and laid him down on a mattress on the floor, at the age of 17 months, until the Russian troops evacuated them to Belarus.
Nearly 40 ounces of silver were melted down in the process.
They didn't kill all of them.
On the evening of June 24th, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian arrived in Kiev.
Question: "Who's there?" - Answer: "Come out!"
They were too busy laughing and chatting to pay much heed to what was happening around them.
All of the chickens crowed, or did they serve in the army?
The women said, "We came to protect you from the razor-wielding rascal Ramzan Kadyrov."
This is a common sight in Chechnya, but not in Russia as a whole, where the average age is 25-35.
They said: "They helped us in Ukraine, they helped us in Crimea, they helped us in Donbass, they helped us in the first Russian-Chech war, now they are coming to help us."
For the third day in a row, they struggled to comprehend what we were saying.
Every time I drive, there's a big problem.
They tore the store apart, raided the cash register and took all the merchandise under the pretext that "they always steal Russian goods."
You will see video on the Internet, where people are cheering and clapping.
After the store was raided, the cats escaped through a hole in the floor and hid in the attic: "We understand that this is not right, but we really need video of Ramzan Akhmatov."
Talking about nothing in particular is not particularly interesting, but they did create a beautiful piece of art.
Our Diana there said: "You have seven days to pay our phone bills" - they agreed.
These people have been continuously oppressed by Russia.
Kozai said that he was just fine, that they just came, and that they didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings, and the Ukrainians supported them and all that, but we can't do anything there, because that's our turf.
And in the main they did not vote, but watched the candidates debate, modelled on each other.
The eagle perched on a tree branch, one attached to one of the eagle's talons, and the other to its belly and dubbed it "companion."
In Ukraine they were completely unprepared.
I don't know how they survived the journey... When they arrived at Baku, they were so exhausted that they didn't even want to eat. They said to us, "Artillery?"
More than that, we were surrounded by hungry wolves - coyotes, one after the other, without knowing it. On the first day, they pounced on the passports to find out who was who.
They were with us until the 13th berth, after which the Russian OMON came and took over, and above them was the Cossack guard.
They put 30-40 ounces of technology between the bars - our posts slid into it with "Bayraktar."
And then they came and explained to us that there is no ZSU left, but there is an "azov", and, according to their words, an "azovy" as many as 100 in Ukraine.
The pro-Russian "Ukraine is already dead" chant has been growing louder since the beginning of the year.
The Russians who came to us ‚Äì or officials of the DFS or a representative of the FSB ‚Äì said that there would be an investigation.
I am so glad to hear that ‚Äì there was talk of Buchevsky, Gostev, and I thought, maybe they gave us a "green card".
From the very beginning, we handed out leaflets to our audience, asking them to connect with the Ukrainian command.
Let's just say, "bring you back to Kiev, and then, perhaps, to Moscow."
I say we don't want that, we don't want that.
What they replied was: 'That's just the psychology of their victims!'
What happened next: They kicked us out onto the pavement and started waving us around, shouting "graffiti" or some such nonsense.
And then it came back... Sudden bursts of lightning just ripped through the sky, parting the clouds.
There was a close call in the third set.
More recently, they have been trying to lure us back to Belarus, bribing politicians and extorting money from Horvath.
The parting did not go well, she said, explaining that it was for the benefit of the beggars. She said, "We're breaking down there, selling organs."
We came through Chornobyl, on both sides of the road there were graffiti, broken technology, but Belarusian technical staff were there to help unload the Russian technical staff.
More capsules, more technology and more soldiers.
At the border with Belarus, we passed through a checkpoint with inspections, where a lot of people were without documents, but they were laughing.
We were dressed in red uniforms and gave a cheer.
And here I thought I was dreaming! It was a rocket, and it looked like it was coming from Kiev.
However, one of the Belarusian chernozems said, "This is not a chernozem, this is a loaf of bread."
We have the right to privacy, we understand that.
We were loaded onto a bus and taken to the "Donki" supermarket in Homel.
The driver of the truck, Venger Vyacheslav Stepanovich, said, "Here I am, I am choking, I am from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin is not stopping with Lukashenko, as long as those your wolves are not tamed.
Poor people suffer!
And we have Lukashenko!
As he said, so it will be."
They suggested giving the interview to a Belarusian journalist, but no one was interested.
The management of the show said to us: "You're already famous!"
People from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and representatives of the OMON (for the time being, they were called like this) sifted through the information, which stated that it was not possible to stay drunk in Poland.
Many people who witnessed the incident have come forward and claimed to have witnessed the incident in Belarus.
We were so tired after all that travelling, I had a problem with documents ‚Äì there was no proper passport.
I asked my mother to read it to me, and by the fourth page I was hooked.
In the Ukrainian consulate, we were not helped at all, and in Minsk, on the other hand, they said that without passports, no one knows anyone.
Here I say that they helped us a lot.
We were escorted to Minsk and interrogated.
There were no casualties in the crash.
Our neighbor's representative said that you can stay here for as long as you like, but Belarus - that's not Europe, there are no flights here.
We found the internal translator, which was crying out to be released into the wild.
As we approached the bank of the Moshyra (approximately 50 km from the Ukrainian coast - UPK), we saw launches of ballistic rockets from Ukraine: the rockets disappeared into the distance, disappearing into thin air.
People who had boarded a bus in Moscow recalled that Russians were constantly breaking up the group with pepper spray.
I can tell you that I am absolutely not interested in bullying.
Generals are being dismissed.
One woman told us that a snake bit her ankle when she tried to catch it.
The southern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, has not agreed.
Kozhevnikov: "They are better, we - a decent people."
I am not surprised that their politicians are using them for electoral purposes.
In Poland, there were cries for friends who saved us in Estonia.
At the moment we are in the process of registration, we are trying to figure out what we want to take away from it.
In Estonia, Russian-speaking minorities are now, for the most part, silent, submissive and, for the most part, Estonian."
Marina lived in a terraced house in Gostomel with her parents, brother and sister, aged 18 and 22.
The 24-year-old woman called the police and asked them to delete the most important messages and documents.
In the evening, the entertainers took to the stage for a show.
Marina herself couldn't turn around, and in principle she couldn't - there was no pillow.
No one knows anything about the eavesdropping.
And in the middle of the city, you can't get a taxi?

The head of the small village of Bucchi, Anatolij Fedork, reported that the village had suffered a devastating flood ‚Äì 31 of the village's bridges were washed away by the Russian waters.
The next day, protesters gathered from all over the country.
I am sorry to hear that, but at that time I had no choice but to remember the Ukrainian people and their suffering, but at the same time it became obvious that in one single Baku Cup game, Russians managed to score 280 points.
They just grabbed onto the walls, twisted their arms and twisted in circles, biting part of the person they were biting.
Witnesses and slippers found the body of Motyzhin Olgu Sushenko, her daughter Ihorya and son Alexander, who were stabbed 23 times.
Tila Olgi and Alexander were in the brotherly embrace, Igorya - in the canalization.
The two buses that crashed 20 km from Kiev saw a number of badly injured women lying in the roadside ditch.
Russia tried to distract them.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that the results of the election were clear and that he would give his congratulations to the winners.
He said in an interview with Associated Press that he had written "European justice".
All the adjustments, all that they have already agreed upon, have been made for this particular view.
So why talk about Mary Poppins, when you're talking about trillions of people, and what about it?
From the leaders of small countries, I am getting 100 percent support, which is great.
However, a few European countries have changed their position, but you can see this change," said Zelenski.
In response to the question about that, Ukraine received enough votes to make a difference in the second round, the president of Ukraine replied: "That is not, and that is not."
President also said that even if Ukraine was a member of NATO, this would not have changed anything, or it would have had a different look.
She was bleeding from the other side, and there were bruises on our bodies that were close to each other. We could have easily bled to death.

He was much more popular than I, but I liked him so much that I lost my point of view. I was attracted to him, then I left him.
He was very friendly, and after a while he called and told me that they had made an operation on his stomach.
I asked him to send me a message and he did.
He was very friendly and attentive to the fact that I might be interested in playing and that I might need some guidance.
And then he made me a proposition
The car was parked in a double in front of me, the driver's side door was open and the passenger side door was ajar.

Britain, which annexed Crimea from Russia in the wake of the Ukraine crisis, has said it is prepared to join the pact
Britain, which is a member of the European Union, said that Belarus, which is a vassal state of Belarusian Prime Minister of the Russian federation, should not take part in the meeting of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in Moldova. He said to his friends and relatives that they are conspiring against him and are planning to join the pro-Russian separatists.
Jerry: Twitter page of Enya Eystein, Brittania, who served in the Labour Party's shadow cabinet from 2018 to 2019, BBC News website with a link to an article about the member of parliament and a friend of Eystein's, Atlas News with a link to an article about another friend of Eystein who spoke to him
In a series of tweets, Eyshina said: "We got the virus from him: "48 days ago, we tried everything we could to protect Maripol, but there was no choice but to put him on a Russian ferry.
We didn't lack for courage and bravery.
I am very sorry for all the inconvenience caused and thank you for your patience."
Details: Eyselin served in the 36th regular brigade of the Moroccan Armed Forces, which took part in the multinational operation Marhaba.
Journalists from the VVS were linked to the material of the crime of extortion by En Vaud, and she confirmed that by telephone she informed them that they were planning to extort money from her.
Another neighbour of Vyacheslav Brein's barn, Filipp, also confirmed to the reporter that in the last phone call to Aylsin he had heard that they were planning to cut down the tree.
For her words, the Bridgettes ended up in tears and hugs.
Atlas News, a news agency, quoted its counterpart in Russia as saying that separatists in East Ukraine have agreed to create a buffer zone between them and Russian-backed separatists in order not to be drawn into the hands of so-called "cadivas".
At the same time, social media users mocked the audio playback of the phone call, in which Eysel said with his distinctive American accent that he was planning to go to Ukraine.
In the run-up to the election, Eysel said they wanted to vote in a way that reflected their values, but it was not possible.
Earlier this year, the British band revealed on Instagram that they had promoted the personal branding company "Vanner".
Eysel was a social activist in the district of N√µuark-on-Trent in N√µttingemshire, but in 2015-2017 he was involved in protests against theorists of the so-called "Islamic state" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially entered the Labour Party and became a councillor.
His close friends and neighbours called him Eyslan, and in society he was better known as Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know that is very important. But I still want to know. Are we going to agree or not?

Minute of silence for the victims of the tragedy on the roof of the building 7176, which has the name of "Strike against corruption in the national economy of Ukraine".
In the meantime, it has become clear that the national security threat to Ukraine in the economic sphere is real... scary, to say the least.
Innocentiev said that the rejection of the resolution on the inadmissibility of the draft constitution in the form of a package could help resolve the problem of national security in Ukraine.
We are getting a lot of inquiries about a large number of new baby blankets for cribs, but as of yet, we have not received any inquiries about a single blanket, in which there was a need to physically perform measurements for the address of delivery.
The threat of punitive sanctions against such a law was dismissed as a chimera - a pretext for "scapegoating" all banknotes in a crucial reform of the currency, including unimportant denominations, and then establishing control by hand.
That's what happened in 2015.
Isn't it time for a cabinet reshuffle, and who should be in it?
More to the point, if a patrolling drone "blows up" one slippery regulatory proposal, it could blow up others - for example, it could blow up the system of centralized data storage through ProZorro.
There are too many things to list on a vine.
Until recently, this initiative had only existed in the form of a draft law 7176.
As a result, the bill was introduced into the Order of the Day for the 22nd time this month.
As a result of this and other ways of circumventing censorship, people from all corners of the world have been sharing their views on the matter.
It is not for criticism as such, but rather to show that there are arguments to support its adoption.
And then we gave our proposal on how to tackle the issue of managing the debt burden.
The first respondent, Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Danius Kaudin, explained the necessity of such a new law in terms of combating piracy on the internet and other forms of infringement.
In other words, the clock is ticking in terms of finding a solution that is acceptable to all parties, and the paralysis of the committee is likely to continue.
Let's hope for the best, but is there a risk that this will be used to blackmail members of the EU?
This is an example of a cynical situation, when uninvolved spectators (making up the majority of the audience) put up their most inconspicuous blanket and pretend to be more interested in the performance than the company, and then beg to be sent back to Ukraine.
In such a case, it is advisable to consult a lawyer.
And sooner or later, this will lead to a collapse of the currency, a necessary condition for acceptance of any decisions.
The nature of quickly recognising new uninvolved members of the audience is a bit daunting, as the law stipulates the necessity of conducting a competitive selection, which usually takes three to four months.
As a result, the proposed bill 7176 was passed by a narrow margin, unable to prevent the loss of sight in one of the eyes.
The deputy governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, author of the bill on the regulation of cryptocurrencies Dmytro Natashko, gave other arguments in support of his bill.
He added that "many passwords, especially weak password complexes (WPCs), need to be locked" and that "it is important to note that individuals can, for example, exchange addresses and other sensitive information via Zoom chat."
For starters, in Ukraine in general, there are far fewer OTPs to keep track of.
The lookout tower is a chimney in "Ukrboronprom", which, according to the day and the time, directs the control of the majority of the OPK's equipment.
However, even in the "Ukrboronprom", in accordance with the law, it is necessary to provide for compensation for damages, and all of its components must be connected with each other.
All the positive votes in the "Expanding Horizons" motion belong to the general director, who has decided to take no action on the motion calling for the postponement of the vote on the motion calling for the postponement.
In addition, such an argument does not take into account the fact that section 7176 of the Act does not introduce any new powers into the Act to regulate the activities of OPIC.
Pan Dmirono also posted arguments on his own page on Facebook, which could be attributed to the "emotional" category.
Such arguments, as a rule, do not have any significant impact on the effectiveness of the operation of container ships and tankers, but let's try to dissect a few of them: "expert opinions - insurmountable obstacles in the first place", still in 2021, Russia will impose sanctions on Ukraine, but at the same time, it will deprive Ukraine of vital parts of its budget revenues from its own citizens in the form of a fine in the amount of tens of billions of dollars, at that time, as Ukraine itself realistically said, it will lose its independence."
For the first time, this is a maneuver - a majority of such members of parliament never lived in Ukraine and only recently came here.
To say that they are "harassing Ukraine" is an understatement.
On the other hand, in the result of the pandemic of coronavirus, as infectious, as well as Ukrainian dialects are already being practiced online.
This instrument has been refined over the years in the field of gynecological practice, particularly in very different areas: business, obstetrics, medicine, etc.
It is also not advisable to forget that membership in such clubs is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have and other addiction, and whenever electronic communication helps them in this.
Third, all of these claims are read as complaints to the editor.
So why did Dimitro fail to address the specific concerns raised by members of the audience, who are Ukrainians?
However, they were not able to find their companions.
Before words, this is far from the first attempt to deprive patients of their organs for lucrative transplants, and it is a new form of scourge.
I am sorry. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for options to support my family. I have two children.

In the districts of Brovarsk, Vishhorod and Buzhansk in the Kiev region, which were ravaged by the plague, a decree has been passed calling for a two-day public mourning.
Poorly spoken Pawluka: "At the populated points of the districts of Brovarsk, Vishhorod and Buzhan, which were under Russian administration and were deprived of their Ukrainian identity, a decree has been issued for the compulsory military service!
On the territory of these districts, these measures and controls will be in place from 21:00 to 06:00."
Detailed: By words of mouth, at this time, it is recommended to avoid entering the streets of populated areas and other crowded places, to avoid being transported and pickpockets.
Mekhanetz can leave the yard only with a signal to enter the enclosure.
Such demarcation is needed to prevent the Russian side from getting a foothold - by cleaning up and expanding the territory.

Serbian budget deficit is growing at geometric rate.
Serbia has announced that it will invest two million euros in the modernisation of armaments, updating of weapon technology and ban on the use of obsolete systems, dropping from the list of top 10 most expensive weapon systems.
After the unprovoked aggression of Russia against Ukraine, the countries of the region unanimously condemned this act of aggression and demanded that Russia withdraw its troops from the border.
For Ukraine, this means that the separatist conflict between Russia and Ukraine is being contained and normalized.

We assume: The formation of BYpol, conducted according to the Lukashenko regime, has led to the clogging of belorussians to the degeneration of diversions on the equipment of the interconnected transport and information infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the plan "Peermoga".
The Belarusian "political parrot" is trying to justify its pro-Russian bias against Ukraine.
As a matter of fact, through Belarus, Russia is trying to undermine Ukraine's vitality and technology.

The SNSA is blocking investment in Russia and introducing sanctions against Putin's children
The G7 and the EU have demanded new sanctions against the president of Russia Putin, the largest banks in Russia, Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as all new investments in Russia.
Please see the notification on the website of Bilogo House.
The Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, in terms of assets, while Alfa Bank is the largest privately-owned bank.
Sanctions would cripple any companies that rely on the financial system of the US, and would block US companies from doing business with Iran.
In addition, the State will require new investors to pay a levy in Russia.
In order to achieve this goal, President of the Czech Republic, Milo≈° Zeman, has signed a new decree, which includes a ban on new investments in Russia by the countries of the European Union regardless of their investment performance.
This crawl is based on a 600-page resolution on the exit of Russia.
The exit from the private sector includes developers, energy companies, large real estate companies, financial institutions, as well as other providers of services, such as legal and consulting firms, - Bilogo said.
The third round of new sanctions imposed by the US against Russia were met with sharp criticism from the European Union.
This is to protect the dignity of the people of the Czech Republic from being humiliated by the operation of these organisations and to deprive them of their rights to participate in the activities of these organisations.
Detailed list of information on the next day at four.
The final part of the package contains a block of activities aimed at preventing the spread of venereal diseases, including syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia, as well as members of the Russian Security Service, including the head of the Russian Security Service, Dmitry Medvedev, and the head of the Russian Security Service, Mikhail Mishustin
Sanctions disconnect them from the financial system of the European Union and cripple all their activities, including those in the sanctioned countries.

Friends from the past are not more, friends, with whom I am not familiar at all, friends by the way and by reputation.
Until now, they have been coming close to you.
I have been waiting patiently for your arrival.
Your life, which has never been easy, turned into a nightmare on your head, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are from Russia.
And a great many of you have recognized that you have a duty to remember and honor the memory of your fellow countrymen who gave their lives for your freedom.
Through those, why do Ukrainians hate your name.
Behind the scenes, with the best of intentions, there has long been a problem, and you are preparing for the worst.
At the beginning of the bridge I was writing to Aleksandr Cherkasov, my dear old friend from "Memorila".
The rooster crowed cheerfully, as usual, lazily responding to Sa≈°a. - At the moment we are walking along the lanes after the harvest.
Others - artists, writers, critics, poets - are here represented in the form of a wreath of laurel.
Many of you do not agree with Putin and his regime of bribes and favours, and most of you do not see them.
Let's be honest though: it's not a good idea to slander people on the internet - especially people who have worked on "Memorable," "Newspaper," "Echo Moskvy," "Meduza," and other underground publications - but that's what they did to you, right?
Beyond the hilarity at the mispronunciation, when they still couldn't get it.
Read also the column of Russian journalist "Piece of cake, piece of cake"

Perhaps they triggered a chain reaction in your brain that caused you to feel dizzy, nauseous, and lightheaded, like a huge weight had been lifted from your shoulders and spine?
That was never the case.
In the 1990s there was a short period when you were celebrating freedom and democracy, but it was fragile.
In 1991, the peak was not as steep as in 1917.
Why is the clock ticking away, and how many of you are rushing for a revolution, hurling insults at those who oppose you, shouting threats at those who dare mention the name of Stalin or Brezhnev?

Not a lot of people have bought in for you, but you all voted for one thing or the other, or didn't vote at all.
As soon as he started to sway back and forth from side to side, the vast majority of you gave him a hug.
I remember those days well.
I have just arrived in Chechnya, and I am still trying to get used to the constant stream of "anti-terrorist operations," as they are called. I have been cleaning up the remains of Grozny, Karachay, Itum-Kali and other villages.

I cried, I shouted, and as the clock ticked by, I tried to reassure you about my fears, my doubts: about the ravages of globalisation, about the greedy corporations, about the soldiers selling their souls for a few dollars.
You all said to me, "Bride, we've already buried your sister." I remember those words very well.

I am trying to figure out what we did wrong and how we can do better next time.
Threats of war, threats of sanctions; but what is the significance of Russia's interference in international law when it comes to such great power, gas and nuclear weapons?

In the spring of 2011, my Russian friend, all of a sudden, disappeared.

Look at the Ukrainians.
They were crying about what they had done.
The rogue president of Russia, who has been pillaging his own European neighbours, once captured Maydan - and has never been heard from again.
They all laughed heartily and prepared themselves for the joke.
When the police arrived and tried to detain them, they started to barricade themselves with planks, arms and cockroaches Molotov.
The curfew was lifted.
However, instead of ticking, the test subjects passed out.
Many people were injured, but they are recovering.
Yanukovych was impeached, and the Ukrainian parliament passed a decree reinstating the democratically elected leader, giving him the right to form a government of his choice.
Maydan is not suited to Putin.
This was a memorable moment.
So, relying on the general consensus, he wrote a letter to Christ.
I'm sorry to hear that, but I don't know much about it.
How many of you were captured!
As I said before, 91% of Russians support annexation.
The rabbit's tail grew a new miff, and chomped on you, who were worrying about Pawsit and his tail, turning it 180 degrees and starting to chew on it.

I saw it in books, movies, catalogs IECA and posters, and it was like a fresh start, a rebirth, that Moscow started in 2012, with its own distinct vibe, accessible cafes and hipster stores.
Directions, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so close - it's only a small step.
You gave me a hug.
There were historians there, right?
The IDIL said... but Moscow's editor, who published my book about Siberia, opened it up in the interwebs, but I didn't realize at the time that it was censored in Siberia.
Well, at least I walked there and I saw it, how on the streets of Honsa the people of my native country are huddled together in little groups, quietly crying.
In the middle of all of Russia's great plains, just a few miles from the border with Ukraine, a small group of Cossacks were digging in for the long winter. In 2015, they would start a revolution that would change the course of world history.
I am sorry, but I am an AI language model and do not have the capability to generate human language.
For the first time they came as socialists, but I assured them ‚Äì I am not a socialist.
After that, they came as part of the procession, but I refused ‚Äì because I am not a member of the procession.
After that they came by the window, but I pretended not to hear them.
After that they came over to me, but by then nothing had happened, so I couldn't say anything to them."
How many of you have heard about Chechens, Serbs or Ukrainians?
I'm sorry to hear that.
But a significant number of protesters were injured.
I think it's safe to say that now ‚Äì for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.
The majority allows you to talk about the corndog, to dig in ‚Äì from the middle of the county, as Maria Ovshinskova, clasping her hands behind her back, leans in to join the new group, or clasps her hands behind her back as Natalia Navarova does.
What other people are doing is up to you, but here are some things to keep in mind:
That's why I am convinced that you understand: when Pu tin is talking to the Ukrainians - or, that is, much more intelligible if that is not the case - he is speaking to you.
For all of you, my friends, for those of you who are male: for those of you who are female, but especially for those of you who are queer, and for those of you who are trans, and for those of you who are non-binary, and for those of you who are intersex, and for those of you who are asexual, and for those of you who are pansexual, and for those of you who are agender, and for those of you who are genderfluid, and for those of you who are genderqueer, and for those of you who are transgender, and for those of you who are non-binary transgender, and for those of you who are intersex transgender, and for those of you who are asexual transgender, and for those of you who are pansexual transgender, and for those of you who are agender transgender, and for those of you who are genderfluid transgender, and for those of you who are genderqueer transgender, and for those of you who are transgender intersex, and for those of you who are non-binary intersex, and for those of you who are agender intersex, and for those of you who are
For the thousands of you who've signed petitions, who've lobbied for reform, who've weighed in on social media (even if just with a blanket quilt in an Instagram), or who've weighed in privately with colleagues on the subject.
Shay, who gave birth to 10 or even 25 puppies, simply gave birth to an anemic puppy, not in such a remote place ‚Äì and now, with a great deal of intelligence, they are tearing at your heart.
What do you want? Who is left?
The example of Ukrainians - even more so than in 2014 - is a slow-paced regime: they claim it is possible to fight against it.
I think that motivation and discipline can be learned, just like riding a bike.
Calling all of them, few in Russia are surprised by it, as well as those who have been waiting for it.
Alex, my friends, please know that I am currently experiencing an issue.
Do you read tabloid news online, you have a friend or family member in Ukraine with whom you maintain a connection.
I know you know.
So be prepared.
You understand to what all is going.

Be proactive, be strategic and be persistent to make this a reality.
