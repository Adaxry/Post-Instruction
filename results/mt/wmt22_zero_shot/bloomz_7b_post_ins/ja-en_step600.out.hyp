Because there's such a thing, I don't want to watch TV anymore...
Is it true that the entertainer became unreasonable? TV is just for entertainers.
Yesterday, I saw a scene where the staff were laughing hysterically behind my back while I was watching Horimiya on Netflix.
There is no doubt that there are things that are obvious, but it's not funny to say "it's all because he's a selling artist".
However, if the staff don't laugh, the performer may feel uncomfortable and the job may not be enjoyable.
Just like the old black enterprise, that industry is a bunch of sports clubs, and a lot of artists have egos that are too big and have a plainly negative attitude. If they don't change their attitude, they won't eat.
There are a lot of people who feel that the celebrity is too busy with their own work and that they are licking the celebrity.
I understand that the income is not very high even before the sale, but as a performer, it's a job that requires a lot of hard work and dedication.
It is impossible to hear justifications for the aestheticization of one's own community and the amusement of clowns in the media and society.
When I say honest, I mean that the industry itself, which I am working in, is a bit shady, but the people in the entertainment industry are getting more and more shady.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I felt bad when I didn't go out like usual...

Customers were able to exchange their purchases at the Taku Monnet Shop
The offer: If you register the wireless mouse, the wired version of the mouse will arrive, and if you want to get the money back, you can send it back
This is more of a retail problem than a topic for DIY PCs, so I'm not going to write about it here.
Starting from the previous gold moon, I found out that the wireless gaming mouse of MSI was sold at 3,280 yen (link to the previous article)
Since there was a cable version with the same price at the store, I checked the page of the cable version and it was confirmed that it was not a mistake that it was priced at 5,071 yen (link to fish拓).
The normal invoice email arrived and the next day the shipping email arrived
The names of these two emails and the purchase history on my page were all written as "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIREL"
Since there was no communication or cancellation notification from the issuer until the delivery of the bond, the issuer thought that the bond was delivered at this time
That was the problem, an email came in saying that "there was a discrepancy in the registration of the goods."
According to that email
The wireless version was sold at a reduced price, but it was actually the wired version
The cable was already disconnected.
I. Refuse to accept and cancel all
The return of only the mouse
Use a wired mouse
The response
There are separate product pages for the cable and wireless versions, with the purchase history and confirmation email also including the wireless version, so it would be easy to mistake the cable version for the wireless version when sending
Knowing the difference between the purchased goods and the goods sent without any understanding, it is not cool to send back the money only if you are happy with it?

Against the backdrop of typhoon and heavy rain, the only bridge connecting the region to the outside world was flooded. Residents stockpiled three times as much food (Yamaguchi, Fukuoka TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Satoru Matsumoto from Fukuyama Prefecture's Yazawa Town Highlands Area.
In 2019, there was a typhoon in East Japan.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "At first, I felt like, 'Oh my god'.
I felt like it was going to collapse in on itself or was going to flow," he said. The only road connecting the highland area, the "Highland Bridge", was swept away by the East Japan typhoon, leaving 31 residents in the area in a state of isolation.
Residents who were cut off from water were forced to carry necessities such as food on a bridge that does not normally allow passage, every day.
Mr. Soma Nobuhiro: "If it's not raining, the car will come to the gate, but if I get out of the car and walk to the other side of the bridge holding the car in my hand, or carrying it on my back, it will take a few days for the bridge to be completed even though it was completed a month ago." The emergency bridge, which was completed a month ago, was once again isolated for several days due to heavy rain.
After two years since the disaster, reconstruction has been progressing, but Mr. Matsumoto is continuing the strategy of learning from the lesson.
Mr. Matsumoto said: "I think there are about 10 cases.
For the time being, I want to ensure that we have something to eat for two to three days," he said, adding that canned goods and rice cakes, among other items, can be used as emergency food.
Ms. Matsumoto said, "Instead of worrying about others, I don't know when disaster will strike my body. So, I feel it's better to be prepared and prepared." On the other hand,矢祭町, which experienced the "non-current disaster" that the bridge was flowing, experienced.
In order not to forget the lesson, the town started its own takeover from 2021.
Yoshimachi, Education Department, Chief Superintendent Takahiro Takahashi: "I would like to set aside October 12 as a day to think about preparedness for disaster in the form of 'October 12, a day to think about disaster prevention in Yoshimachi', and I am getting ready to make an announcement.
Up to this point, there has been an increase in awareness of the possibility of unplanned events,"

The sinkhole of the "Building Condition Inspection System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
The newly established "building condition survey" system aimed at activating the middle-aged housing market
With the construction of the gate, the price of the apartment is also rising, and the resale market is also expanding.
On the one hand, because of the coronavirus pandemic, people are becoming more and more interested in objects such as "station frontage," "station nearness," and "station direct," which are represented by words such as "massive," "tower," etc., and at the same time, there has been a sharp decline in the number of newly built objects that are relatively safe.
However, compared to overseas, the existing (medieval) housing circulation system in Japan is still at a low level.
As a result, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) started an inspection of the condition of buildings in 2018, with the aim of obtaining a building permit for a safe and secure middle-aged residential building (https//www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect skilled in housing checks the condition of the object, including deterioration, and makes a report for the buyer.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the introduction of the exemption would bring benefits to both the buyer and the seller.
The seller is required to conduct an inspection of the item prior to the sale, so that the buyer can have confidence in the item.
The differentiation of the competing items is also related to this.
For the buyer as well as the seller, it is possible to grasp the current condition of the old residential property purchased under the purchase plan, and to make a profit by purchasing it. This is a system that allows one to make a profit by purchasing a residential property at a low price.
However, the main power to conduct the building condition survey under the current system lies with the purchaser side.
In addition, it is also necessary to pay attention to the fact that only notification of the suspension system was made compulsory.
In other words, real estate brokers who take on the role of intermediaries are required to say that "when it comes to real estate brokerage, a building surveyor can be recommended" or "can not be recommended", but the actual implementation of this is not mandatory.
On the other hand, if you look overseas, there are already similar systems in place in the Middle East, such as America and Egypt.
In the early stages of real estate transactions, the buyer will often rely on a specialist called an "inspector" or "building surveyor" to conduct a building survey on the property.
For example, in the US, about 70 to 90 percent of mortgages on historic homes are insured by the state.
As far as the point that "the buyer" is leading the exhibition and "the seller" is the main of the Japanese type of exhibition and its nature are different.
The seller side wants to show the condition of the building more clearly, to the extent possible, and to sell it as soon as possible.
On the other hand, the purchaser wants to think about the contents of the survey and make appropriate repairs to be at ease.
Even if they have the same intention, there are differences between the two.
For this reason, it is said that there is a risk of concern about the Japanese system.
The scope of the investigation into the sales promotion conducted by the country has been narrowed to the minimum.
As there was no detailed investigation, there was a risk of overlooking important discrepancies ● For an investigation company, the broker (seller) who introduces the case to the customer is also a customer.
However, there is a possibility that "speculation" will be carried out, such as not reporting unfavorable results of the investigation

Was Ginza an island?
Talk while wearing silver bracelet (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
This is where the peninsula used to be.
There is a little bit of eccentricity in the fact that... "
I will introduce you to some knowledge of Ginza that you may not know.
Go up to Ginza!
The first dive at Jinzu
As you walk along Ginza, the history of the place is revealed in the changing of the wind, the mystery of the stones, and the many shrines.
Walking along Ginza with her, I was suddenly struck by the silence, which said, "Yeah, this used to be a peninsula.
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
It is the epitome of a bustling street in every part of Japan, and the "S銀座" in Tokyo's central district.
All in all, the name "Ginza" refers to the minting of silver, and in 1612, the current Saitama prefecture was moved to Edo.
At that time, it was called "New Twin Town", but when it was transferred to Nishiwaki Town, it became known as "S銀座".
Previously, there was a "peninsula" jutting out into the sea near Ginza.
Previously to the Edo period, the entrance of Inagawa was connected to Iino, and the peninsula stretching from Japan Bridge to Ginza was called "Iino Peninsula".
The tip of the peninsula is now in Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu established the Tokugawa shogunate in Edo, he buried the Naka River and started to prepare the area around Edo Bridge.
In addition, Ieyasu ordered the construction of streets and the launching of boats to facilitate the transportation of goods.
Then, they dug a trench around the moat and buried Inagawa.
In addition, there is a stone tablet marking the site of the Ginza Post Office (Ginza 2-7) in front of the Tifany Ginza store (Ginza Central), so it may be worth looking for a particular interest.
Knowledge is power: The "holy pilgrimage" of Ginza
In Ginza, there is an annual ritual known as "Sanjusangendo," or "visiting sacred sites," where people know each other.
In the vicinity of the shrines with more than 10,000 temples, the most pleasant one is likely to be the "Kabuki-in Temple" in front of Kabuki-in Temple.
There are few people who watch the play from the right side of the Kyoto Theater.
One side, "Dragon Light Immovable Deity," is on the roof of the Silver Shoe in Ginza, while the "Silver Shoe Birthplace Deity," is on the 9th floor of the Silver Shoe in Ginza.
The shrines of 'Shinnyo-in Temple' and 'Atsuma-in Temple' are located at the back of the road and are low profile, while 'Shinnyo-in Temple' is known to have been worshipped by the famous actor of the Edo period, Ichinichi Yasuhiro. The 'Shinnyo-in Temple' on the 1st floor of Shiseido Ginza Building is not open to the public.
In the vicinity of this shrine, there are places where the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara and the bodhisattva Guanyin are worshiped, but most of the shrines worship rice gods.
In front of the shrine, a fox is said to be waiting to welcome the farmer, who is said to be numerous in places where rice grows well.
This means that, in a city such as Kyoto or Osaka, which is similar to a large metropolis, the benefits of commercial prosperity are said to outweigh the downsides. This is also the case in Ginza, one of the bustling streets of Tokyo.

Discovery of male corpse at Yokosuka, Nagoya (NEC TV News) - Yahoo! News
On the 12th day of the month, a man collapsed and died after being hit by a car in a residential area of Nagoya.
Police are investigating the identity and cause of death of the male.
According to the police, at 11:50 a.m. on the 12th day of the month, a pedestrian found a man lying on the ground in the middle of the road in the village of Nishiwaki, Nagano prefecture, and notified 110.
Men were rescued from the river but one person was confirmed dead at the scene.
Police are also investigating the cause of death.
One male, aged 70 or so, was found dead in the middle of the river on the sandy bank in Fukoka Ward, Kagoshima City.
There were no reports of clothing being torn by men, but there was a report that a motorcycle had crashed nearby.
At the same time, the police were investigating the current situation.
However, if one person in the household is exempted from income tax, will the allowance for the resident tax exemption be paid?

South Korea's Pohang Iron and Steel Corporation has acquired Sinecus Energy in Hwanghae and expanded overseas gas fields = South Korea News (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Posco said it entered into a purchase agreement with Senex Energy on August 12, a purchase agreement with Hancock Energy on August 12 and a purchase agreement with Senex Energy on August 12.
At present, the chain of ownership of Senecus Energy remains unresolved, and the local legal entity has not been recognized, so the acquisition chain is scheduled to finish in March next year.
This time's acquisition is the largest in the history of the company, and will become the world's largest M&A (mergers and acquisitions) when it is integrated into the Posco Group in 2010.
The amount of money raised was 7.709 billion yuan, of which 50.1% was invested in POSCO, 49.9% in Hanako Energy and the rest in other companies.
In the era of energy transformation, the need for natural gas continues to increase, and natural gas-based blue water urea is expected to split the market with gray water-based green water urea, according to the explanation.
As for the purchase this time, the amount of natural gas storage equivalent to 44 percent of South Korea's 2019 natural gas consumption, 8020 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas, will be secured, while the use of gas fields on the ground in Hwanghae will also be guaranteed.

The pain in my knee, if only it were "arthritic knee"!
Different treatments for the same reason (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
The Editor: Recently, I have been experiencing knee pain.
What kind of illness is there?
Mr. Yamashima: The cause of pain in the knee joint is various, such as bone cyst or ligament laxity.
In addition, there are many Japanese people with "transformational joint disease."
Department of Editing: Is it about the section changing shape?
Mr. Yamashima: That's right.
The surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, and it is engaged in bearing the shock and smoothing the movement of the joint.
However, aging or obesity, intense exercise, and other factors can cause the cartilage to be worn down or deformed.
This results in the deformation of the joints and inflammation.
Department of Editing: Is there a risk of osteoarthritis developing outside of the knee?
Mr. Yamashima: Yes.
It can also happen at the kneecap, at the joint between the fingers of the hand, at the head, at the waist, at the toes, at the hip joint and so on.
However, the most common is a case where it starts at the kneecap, which is called "osteoarthritis of the knee joint".
Editor: So, what is the structure of the section?
Mr. Yamashima: The junction is made up of two bones that are concave and convex.
Then, the part of these 2 bones facing each other is covered by “ligamentous cartilage” and surrounded by “ligamentous capsule”.
The editing department: It's a complicated structure.
Mr. Yamashima: That's right.
The inner layer of the joint capsule contains the synovium, which produces synovial fluid.
This lubricant is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
The reason for saying that "hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smoothing the movement of knees" is for this.
Department of Editing: What are the symptoms of scoliosis?
Mr. Yamashima: Ligaments are adhesive and resilient, and are responsible for preventing direct contact between bones.
I guess it is a role similar to that of a clown.
However, if this is reduced, twisted or deformed, it may cause the joints to be deformed or inflammation or may cause pain.

In actuality, it is possible to experience the "Kaiju" series of video games and game 3 (real sound) - Yahoo! News
The popular manga series "Kaiji" focusing on men.
One of the joys of this game is the extreme level of replayability.
(Photo) Just looking at it makes my toes curl...... challenge the iron man!
So, this time we want to check out a game that is actually playable, or is being implemented as an anime.
■沼 「賭博破戒録カイジ」に登場したトラップ滿載のパチンコ「沼」だ。
In the original version, he scored a goal at a high rate of 4000 yen.
This "marsh" has a large trap of "tree forest", "movable object" and "third grade circuit", so the attack was almost impossible.
However, Kaiji used his hands wherever he could, and finally, after knocking over a sink in the building with a bottle, he collapsed to the ground and was tackled.
The "marsh" featured in Kaiji is actually a pachinko. Many people are playing it.
Of course, "one yen 4000 yen," etc. are not true, but the difficulty has been reduced. It may be possible to sense Kaiji's mood.
■ The debtor, who was included in the "Star Side Parade" which was held as an afterthought and which featured kayaking, was said to be a horse-racing enthusiast.
The debtor had to work on not falling on the thin steel skeleton set on the ground at a height of 10 meters while competing in the speed.
Twelve people can participate, and the top two can receive the reward. However, there are only four iron bones, and the safety measure is not enough, and the possibility of dying is quite high.
The risk of falling is high, but it is possible to have an extremely close experience through the "egulbridge" installed at the "Playlife Park Kashiwa", the original site of the professional baseball team Yomiuri Giants.
The iron girder bridge has a height of 20 meters (equivalent to seven floors of a building) and is supported by a single iron girder. A "sky-bridge" and a "victory-bridge" are intended to be built in front of it.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Kora Ryu, a comedian known for his sense of humor, posted a video on his own YouTube channel showing him walking around with a leg brace, and it went viral.
■E Card 2-Player Card Game, "E Card"
The Emperor’s card is 1, the citizen’s card is 8, and the subordinate’s card is 1.
This game is very good, and the emperor is very strong to the citizens, and the citizens are very strong to each other, and slaves are very strong to the emperor.
Kaiji has a strict rule in the play that "if you lose, your ears will be chopped off" against Rinagawa.
Kaiji noticed that the device, which was designed to break the eardrum like the one used in the final battle of Iwo Jima, could sense pulse and temperature changes and send the information to the brain, and concluded that the device could be used to confuse the enemy and win the battle.
The card can be purchased in stores, and can also be purchased through Amazon.
YouTuber Hikaruru, who is popular, has posted a video on YouTube in which he played the part of Kaiji in the movie, and a video in which he played a card game against E.
Do you feel like crying?
No one wants to be in Kaiji's situation, but reading the manga made me feel bad.
You may feel the worldview through the game.
One step closer to the New Year, softly pushing back
In the prefecture of Iwate, which is preparing for the New Year, the great equestrian statue of the year of the horse (Tora) of the next year was unveiled.
On the 11th, the design students from the Northeast Art and Science College visited the same shrine and performed a declaration ceremony in front of the shrine.
The shrine has been entrusting the original painting of Emaki to art students since last year.
This time, the nine people who drew the Japanese painting course under the guidance of Professor Masayuki Minami were selected from among the 3-year old Yui (22)'s works.
The large painting is 3.3 meters wide and the height of the center is about 1.8 meters.
Mr. Takahashi said that he drew the image of "walking into a new year with a gentle push from cherry blossoms".
The statue of the turtle standing still and gazing at the cherry blossom flower had the wish that "it would change drastically in the world, but still have the ability to admire the beauty of nature."
The design of Mr. Takahashi is also featured in the print.
Shinichi Ishikawa (44) from Gondae said, "I think everyone will become a helper to help everyone overcome difficulties."

Thinking of continuing to live in Yamaguchi.
What is the town of Yamagata in 2020?
Students from four universities in the city of Yoshino met to discuss the topic of "continuing to live in Yoshino" in a workshop.
As part of the investigation and policy proposal project of the "Mirai Dokusuri Center" of the Central Support Organization, the voice of the young people was gathered to make a proposal to the mayor.
Isn't it always fun?
In response to the question of the fascist, the student said that, "When a lot of people crowd around," or "When I am being dragged by a group of people," etc.
It opened for the first time on November 13 at the Ryokan.
Eighteen university students and people from the area talked about the theme of the "archipelago" while moving around the "world café", about the "beautiful town", the "pleasant town" and the "town where one feels alive".
Each thought is written on a slip of paper and stuck on a cardboard.
The town with a large number of young people is pleasant to live in "Transportation such as trains and buses is not needed for the convenience of living."
There is no common point, and they are talking to each other.
Yamaguchi thought that he was unruly, but the fact that he was able to clean the coastline was attractive," said Yamaguchi's third year student (18).
The third-year student (18) of Beinan Gakuen said, "The store is small but the transportation is inconvenient. However, the natural beauty is nice." He also said that he and the adults also talked about the regional issue.
The second meeting in December was only for college students, and they discussed the content of the proposal.
The Mayor and the Chief Education Officer will be invited to make a statement in February next year.
The president of the East Riva Center said that "while nurturing the patriotism of college students, if the young people get involved in mucking around, it will be the main reason."

According to the Meteorological Agency, the epicenter was located in the southern part of Tochigi prefecture and the depth of the epicenter was about 50 kilometers.
The magnitude of the earthquake is estimated to be 5.0.

How to find it Straighten the new wrapping paper (Economic News) - Yahoo! News
However, there is no place to keep warm in winter.
It is said that it is better to adjust the balance while looking at the mirror, but it is difficult to tell at this time whether it is correct or not.
If the cloth is not torn, and if there is a place where it can be neatly folded... I have found a new thing if I think about it.
The brand store of "COTTON (Cotori)" has a long row of about 1 meter and a more compact size than that of general stores.
When I first saw it, it was so short that I couldn't wrap it up.
If you look closely, you can see that it is woven into a thin and long cloth, and the whole is a net.
The edge of the net is designed to allow the end to pass through.
Therefore, it is possible to connect the ends without crimping them.
The material is very light and warm.
This year, sleeveless tops and jackets (bestsellers) are popular, but many people are wearing them in a way that keeps their shoulders warm.
I think it would be convenient to have such a place.

Get Buck is a pitter-jaws
I felt like I was in the midst of a bustling city, with bustling streets and bustling people …
Because it was before the dissolution, Kisu Kisu was doing its best, but it was not the dramatic Kisu Kisu I had expected.
While struggling to keep up, he said something like, "But hey, I know what I am doing!" or, "But hey, I am a pro!" or, "But hey, I am so tired!" or, "But hey, I am so sleepy!" or, "But hey, I am so hungry!" or, "But hey, I am so bored!" or, "But hey, I am so busy!" or, "But hey, I am so stressed!" or, "But hey, I am so overwhelmed!" or, "But hey, I am so exhausted!" or, "But hey, I am so frustrated!" or, "But hey, I am so discouraged!"
That is, they did not like each other so much that they made such a fuss, but there was a lot of air of "maybe we should just do our jobs together", which was pleasant.
And then, even in that kind of atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone really comes alive
Just a little bit of flash and everyone is asking each other, "So, how about that?" and the process of getting to that "that song" is awkward
The moment when Get Buck is particularly impressive
The song was sung in a raspy voice, and the lyrics started to come in as if the singer was exhausted.
It's not easy to see the process of composition in such a way
After all, it's only a matter of time before everyone gets used to it and enjoys the performance.
Although it was only one episode from the third season, at that time, the biggest reason for the dissolution seemed to be the surrounding environment rather than Beatrix, right?
The four of them always started their performances with a joke, but when it came to the question of where they were going to perform, the performer or someone like that said, "Of course, Beatles are the best band in the world!" and everyone started shouting it out. It was easy to understand that they were separating their hands.
However, the director of the drama is also interpreting the role of the director, so it is not impossible that Peter Jackson felt that way...
After all, Poole is overseeing the trial, so it's no surprise there were a lot of awkward moments

Amidst a spate of attacks in the US, a large number of victims - Yahoo News
From the night of August 10 (Monday) to the night of August 11 (Wednesday), the dragon boat was common in the southern United States.
At this time, a strong cold front moved southward, resulting in a very unstable atmosphere and rapid development of cumulonimbus clouds.
Warm air from the south was flowing into the southern part of America, resulting in a record-high temperature.
The highest temperature recorded in Huston, Texas, was 30 degrees Celsius on August 9 (morning) and August 10 (afternoon).
The warmth of the record-keeping was so intense that it made me feel like I was in a sauna, with strong cold air descending to around 5,500m above sea level, causing a large temperature difference and a lively front. The front looked like it was following the front, with rapidly developing cumulus clouds.
The dragon is said to have appeared around the area.
The southern United States is generally an easy area for dragon flies to occur, but from early summer to summer, high season, cases of large damage are not common.
The Dragon Scroll alert, released on December 1, was close to 150 times.
The U.S. National Weather Service said it received 400 reports of tornadoes and other severe storms over the past 10 days (Monday).
As a result, it is understood that there will be two concentrated areas, one on the southern side of the line from Kentuckian to Tuscan and the other on the northern side of the line including Illinois.
In Kanagawa prefecture, the EF scale (improved Fujita scale) shows the strength of the Typhoon Trami, and the EF3, which is the third strongest from the top of the six-level EF scale, has been sighted. It was reported that a sudden gust of 70m/s was blowing at the time.
It is also possible to determine EF4 to EF5 based on the results of the next survey.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese version of the Fujita scale) is used, which is based on the Fujita scale.
JEF3, which is comparable to this time's American dragon, is likely to occur in Japan as well, at the level of destroying wooden houses.

There was a voice asking for help from the bottom of Mt. Fuji (Yomiuri Sports) - Yahoo! News
In the Midwest and South of the United States, President Biden said on the 11th day of the month (August 12, local time) that it was a "one of the largest dragons in the history of the United States".
CNN reported.
Vidal emphasized that he would "do whatever it takes to form a government of national unity."
She said, "It is still not clear who was the victim."
The number of dead surpassed 100.
【Photo Gallery】In the state of Kentuckian, residents have been transporting goods such as furniture and household items from the collapsed house since the night of October 10 to the morning of October 11. A dragon has been born in Kentucky and other six states, surpassing 30.
As a victim of Typhoon Morakot, there is a record of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) of damage inflicted on Mizushima prefecture in 1925, but meteorologists at CNN estimate that this time the damage was about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In the field where the victim was killed, there was a large amount of Christmas merchandise that was still being worked on, ready for the Christmas shopping season. The factory also suffered a large amount of damage.
At that time, 110 people were on duty, but the building was destroyed and the traces disappeared.
In the darkness, about 1.5 meters thick, a woman who had become motionless under a garbage can without being able to move was feeling the weight of rescuers searching for her on the garbage can. She asked for help via a live broadcast from a smartphone.
The live broadcast, which was released, also featured the cries of women calling for help, as well as the song "Happy Birthday to You" sung in tears by another woman to frighten other women.
Store clerk Anber Bradshaw, who lives in Meifield, said he and his five-year-old son hid in the basement of their home after hearing about the dragon's attention report.
There were a lot of people who compared the sound of the train to the sound of something exploding, he recalled.
The police officer in charge of the Meifield police station said the search operation would continue until it was no longer necessary.
I don't know how many weeks, how many months, or how many years it will take for that to happen," he continued.
Internet retail giant Amazon's warehouse in the state of Iriya collapsed in part, with at least six deaths confirmed.
The impact of the collision was so strong that the train's two carriages were separated, and the high-speed road was also blocked by the carriages.
According to MyWebMedia, about 400,000 houses in Texas were without power.

If there is a "room for rent" advertisement in a hotel or a residential area, it is possible for both the accommodation and the source of income to be secured, but the coronavirus epidemic is a current social situation, and there are few options.
Just like there is such a site if I squint my eyes,
The job of the resident member of the board - resident member searcher (Suminavi)
The search terms related to this topic include "expatriation," "immigration," and "work." So it is likely that coworkers are looking for such people.

Is a gynecologist a specialist?
The "specialized doctor" is a doctor who works after the patient's death for 3 to 5 years.
They are also called "specialists" and "advanced specialists".
In other words, a "resident doctor" is a "junior resident doctor", and refers to a doctor who has been practicing for 1 to 2 years after retirement.

There has been a saying that the evaluation system of the star system is different.
In the case of the foreign countries, they are reducing the number of stars from 5 to 3, while Japan is increasing the number of stars from 3 to 4.
However, there is a difference of two stars at the reference point, and four stars are so different in meaning from each other that they are not "works of art" but "masterpieces".
If we compare it to five stars, it is only a "work without a flaw", but if we compare it to all of them, it is a "work at the highest level". Therefore, if there is such a tendency, it is only a flaw in the system that does not indicate the meaning of the star, but if there is such a system, such an application is being made, I would like to ask for three stars (bad rating).
As a result, the people who are advocating for this hand gesture will have no choice but to refute it with Steam's two thumbs down.

The long road of a family with environmental protection activities near the Chinese border (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Kato Toshihiro: Hong Kong-based business partner of Find Asia) China, with its vast territory, is important in terms of biological diversity, and the number of mammal species living there is one of the highest in the world, while the number of plant species is ranked third in the world.
From the perspective of the autonomous region, the value of biodiversity is recognized, and it is found that the autonomous region not only carries out environmental protection, but also promotes the activities of environmental activists.
Yunnan, located in the southwestern part of China, is also one of such areas.
My sister Li Yingda is now an actress. Siriporn is located at the border of Laos and Myanmar, and is shared by the Lao people and the Thai people of the Thai kingdom. Many ethnic minorities live there.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through East and Southeast Asia, is flowing.
Xishuangbanna Autonomous Region (XDR) XDR covers an area of about 0.2% of China, but about 25% of the species of wild animals and 20% of the species of plants are living there.
This time, I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Li Mengguo, who is involved in environmental protection activities in Siraporn, and asking him about the content of the activities.
The husband of a Dusseldorf woman started environmental protection activities - 20 years ago.
The reason for this may have been any number of things.
Mr. Li started our environmental protection activity "Tianzi" in 2000.
The reason is my husband, Josef Margraf.
The husband, who is from Czech Republic, has gone to Syria to work on a contract science project with China.
This is the only hot tropical rainforest area in China, and has been praised for its rich biodiversity.
However, there was also economic development on the other side.
This is why, in order to establish industry in this area and to produce coal that was insufficient in China, large-scale logging of the former tropical rainforest was carried out.
The husband was sent to Denmark for the purpose of restoring natural resources and studying biological resources.
Then, I met the reporter here and married him.
Before that, Mr. Li did not have any interest in nature conservation.
However, I am not interested in the importance of the tropical rainforest or the diversity of life.
As a result, it became necessary to proceed with the project without that knowledge.
Even if the face is straightened, there is no reason to think that the person has a high forehead.

【おま環／個人的備忘】MOD has been blamed for CTD from the environment, and it took about 1.5 months to determine the cause
In the middle of March, when the data was stable, the feeling was that the CTD was caused by a number of reasons, and the feeling was that the time had passed a little bit during the holidays.
Why couldn't I parse the log using the.Net Script Framework (should be clear in a few seconds)? A part of the error was caused by the.dll series and the cache relationship.
The timing of the main CTDs
All Plug-ins and.Net Script Framework, including the type of plug-in that keeps track of logs, have traces.
* When an NPC is killed / attacked cumulatively: the console kill command is also triggered → Essentials are Gone (SKSE plug-in / power of three update re-open version) OFF to improve ※ Is there a possibility of getting wet with this?
When a camera is triggered by an NPC, the PC sets the flash to OFF via the.ini file. This basic improvement is achieved by turning off the flash when DAR + Nemesis relation is set. However, the maximum number of DAR animations is 10,000.
Field movement while casting a spell (e.g. icicle ring) and when hit by an NPC: Dirt & Blood v 2.0's SPID use NPC settings (MCM's upper right) All off, 5 consecutive trials, all improvements.
Is it the result of the addition of an actor's or NPC's armor or body splash? However, the default.ini file for the 2.0 SPID is written with a mistake. As a result, Perk is applied to NPCs.
At first, the check was conducted by putting on wet clothes and focusing on the motion/fighting mode related to the on-hit relation (.dll file). However, such a feeling resulted.
I think there were no similar bugs reported at the level of English or German or French.
If there were one person in the Japanese language environment with the same CTD issue, I would have posted it as a reference.
The knife was in everyone's hand,
People around her didn't notice, and her colleagues were just as clueless.
If you look around, the person seems to be doing a lot of work, which is quite lively, I think.
Maybe he's just shy.
I am not going to retire under the pretext of mental illness, but I think there was a limit before I retired.
The Importance of Psychiatric Visits - Today's Visits End
As I suffer from bipolar disorder, I have been receiving long-distance care, but I am now using the visiting care station that is currently being used by the visiting care worker (female). I think the relationship between them is very good.
Every week, I talk about different things.
Of course, it will also be able to manage medication (in pill form, for example) but, above all, I wanted to think about the importance of pleasant communication for people with mental illnesses, in today's interview.
Today, there was a discussion about the difference between the sexes, or a discussion about jender, or something like that.
I am going to talk about things like the sex drive of men and women, why she divorced him, and so on.
But sometimes I will dress up as a woman.
However, when the psychiatric hospital is working on the visiting care ward, the nanny who has not worked in the ward for a long time has no choice but to work in the ward, and when the visiting care worker is working and the occupational therapist is coming, the nanny said, "this is because we're doing therapy here," etc., from the top of her voice.
The place I am using is a small visiting care facility run by a non-profit organization, but the person with the mental illness is being treated equally to me, and I think she is a really good care provider.
She is also very beautiful.
Visitors to mental health facilities are welcome, while those considering doing so are also welcome.
Visiting care is particularly important for someone with a mental illness.
If the doctor says it's okay to take it, then take it.
Then, let's choose a good visiting care station.
In the past, it was impossible for me to cancel the contract, but now there is a place where I can cancel the contract.
I am sorry to hear that.
It was a fake alarm, but I woke up to it in English.

South Korea's water-saving technology license, China's fifth of one... Water-saving economic roadmap delayed (Central News Agency Japanese version) - Yahoo! News
In 2019, the South Korean government released a water economy roadmap.
The content was that by the year 2022, 60,000 fuel cell vehicles would be popularized (accumulated) nationwide, and 3,100 water-saving stations would be operated.
The target price of hydrogen was set at around 6,000 yen (about 587 yen) per kilogram.
However, in November this year, the fuel cell vehicle was not more than 27% (about 70,000) of the target.
The schedule for the widespread of water ionisation in the core infra is also the target of 38% (approximately 117,000 square meters) and the water ionisation price per cubic meter is the same as that at the time of the roadmap release, 8400 yuan.
It was found that the performance of the government's water-saving economic roadmap was far below the target value.
All Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (All Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, All Japan Federation of Economic Organizations) released a report on the 12th titled "Status and Policy Direction of Aquatic Economic Ecological System".
According to the report, the core component and raw materials of the water industry are mostly dependent on the United States and Japan.
The core material of the fuel cell vehicle is carbon fiber, which is supplied by East Ray (Japan), platinum-based catalyst is supplied by Kashira (Japan), membrane is supplied by DuPont (US), GOA (US), and 3M (US).
The number of water ion exchange licenses held by the six countries (China, the United States, Europe, Japan, South Korea, and the Czech Republic) that dominate the world water ion exchange market has increased by 14% (from 2014) on average every year.
In the field of water production and fuel cell, South Korea ranked fifth in the world (2014-20).
However, full connectivity means that "actually, six countries account for most of the world’s water-saving market, and in fact, the competition among the countries."
The ranking of the country is China, the US, the EU, and Japan.
Since China became No. 1 to the US in 2017, the gap has been widening.
The number of registered trademarks in 2020 was 1,033 in South Korea, up from 974 in Japan and ranked fourth, but only 2.2% of China (4,712).
The full connection proposed that "it is necessary to designate the "water-based technology" as the "equipment investment and research and development expenses tax allowance".
The operation will take about one month and a half.

The successor of the gift tax, which is to be imposed as a "penalty" on the gift of property before death, is in the process of being determined, and the location of the "penalty" has been directly hit by Kajiyama, the former president of the Liberal Democratic Party!
On December 18 of the 12th issue of the Weekly Diamond, the first special edition was published, “Talking with family at the beginning of the year!
It is called "continuation of donation after death".
Concerning the integration of the succession tax and the bequest tax, it was mentioned in the outline of the tax reform for the 2022 fiscal year, but in the near future, there is a possibility that the bequest tax will become a "handcuff".
What about the rule of continuity?
In addition to the direct attack on the former president of the Liberal Democratic Party and the member of the House of Representatives, Haruhiko Kuroda, I am going to make a donation to a charitable organization every year in order to receive a tax deduction.
(Diamond Editor-in-Chief Miyabe Miyabe)
Asset managers to corporate members of the urban division, the use of life gifts is prohibited as a "handcuff". "From the point of view of connecting tax and gift tax, it is necessary to build a neutral tax system in order to choose the period of asset transfer. It is necessary to carry out a genuine investigation" -.
Large fluctuations spread to the middle layer, not only to the asset owners, as was the case with the 2021 tax reform plan released by the party last year.
The reason is that, by doing so, it is possible to change the rule of succession, to make the "生前贈与", which is the only way to reduce the succession tax, a "forbidden hand", and to increase the succession tax.
The iron rule for the tax reduction of progressive tax is "to reduce the assets that become taxable."
The strongest of the cutting-edge bequests, however, was the life insurance bequeathed by the deceased, which was widely used by members who had a home in the three metropolitan areas even though the amount was small.
In the midst of all of this, there was a discussion on the integration of "continuous tax and gift tax".
The 22nd annual tax reform plan, which was released on October 10, said that the most speedy introduction was a matter of concern, and the plan stated that "the current consecutive time accounting tax system and the annuity donation system should be clarified", "the donation tax is not a system that imposes tax liability on the transfer of assets within the limit (sic) within the limit", etc., and pointed out that the goal of integration should be aimed at.
The collection of this issue was said by the former president of the Liberal Democratic Party and the former president of the Liberal Democratic Party.
It is the most important thing to keep the same tax burden regardless of when the property is transferred during the period of property transfer.
At present, (due to the integration), what kind of problem will arise, and where is the simulation being carried out?" If the amendment is made as soon as possible, the chance of the remaining bequest is still 3 times.
However, in the near future, it is likely to be effective as a means of reducing tax as a form of life insurance.
But what about the rules for the succession tax and the gift tax?

【NFL】1 tryout pass 3 times won the team. Players felt what it was like (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! Sports
Jones threw the ball three times.
This was a rare occurrence in the NFL's 50-year history, as the Bills did it twice in the third week of 1974.
In 1974, the Building featured OJ Simpson, an unheralded genius of the RB genre, who topped the chart with his debut album featuring 2,000 songs.
Buildings are said to have crushed jets as the supersonic and another RB jumbo jet, the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar.
This time, it was the extreme weather that was the biggest reason for Pawsit to launch such an extreme offer.
Buffalo is located near the border with Canada in a town close to the Canadian border, and is not affected by the latitude of Hokkaido's Kushiro.
And on this day, the temperature was almost the same as the previous day, the wind speed was 18m/s, and snow was blowing before the match.
The buildings were only on the site, so there was no need to change the selection.
In the case of the 30th lap, Luna was 25 times.
The address of Aaron is 15/30, 145 Yard.
The interior was empty and there was no sign of any forced entry.
The Red Zone was invaded four times in the 10-game series.
Especially since the third quarter, they have advanced three times to the Red Zone.
However, he only scored three points in the three games.
The goalie made a save in front of the final goal.
The buildings that chase after 4 o'clock are 3rd and 9th, 3rd and 14th.
Up to 18 yards.
On 3rd and 14, QB Aaron was tackled by Payton Loftus-Difference and fell to the right pocket.
Then, he aimed at the end zone TE T.J. Nooks and threw the ball, but he failed.
However, on this trial, right winger Stefon Diggs, who was in the outer corner, crossed the ball to the edge of the end zone for Allen, but he couldn't get a look at it.
Fourth and 18 from the left, Aaron aimed for the endzone from the left side of the field, but the pass was knocked down by Pawlett linebacker DB Myles Brayton.
The brakeman was covering the WR call of Burlingame Bayside, but as he watched Aren move, he released the Burlingame Bayside and responded to the path.
Arlen, who saw two riders fall off his bike, threw down his bike twice to try and catch them.
The path for the fourth lap was not decided, but the third lap did not have the need to aim for TD.
It would be better to take the first dive after two dives.
I still had two minutes left, so I decided to go for 4th and Short. I had the ability to go for it.

It is possible that the frequency of replacement is not as high as expected.
In 2017's research, it was found that even though the chimpanzees were cleaned with an electronic line every day, bacteria were still able to multiply a lot (which is why it is important to clean the line).
The researchers in the Czech Republic who carried out the study recommended exchanging sponges once a week to keep them clean.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture said it would replace the mat if it was torn or ripped and there were cuts or tears.
For a time, it was difficult to keep the cleanliness as the scars and grooves were progressing, and the bacteria were proliferating.
If it's still okay, remember to regularly disinfect with liquid bleach (1 gallon [about 3.8 liters] of water mixed with 1 cup [237 milliliters] of liquid bleach) without forgetting to dilute the bleach.
Soak the surface of the plate in the liquid for a few minutes.
The water is crystal-clear, and it is natural to dry it by letting it air-dry or by cleaning it with a cloth.

The study of "Dragon Quest" is just a battle.
The "Equity Exchange of Efforts" is a human anthem <v>(QJWeb Quick Japan Web)</v> - Yahoo! News
In the latest manga, "Dragon Quest" is different from other manga because of the reason of "too much practice."
There are no fights, no battles, no training, and the storyline is boring.
This is the same Jump manga as ONE PIECE, but it was so fast-paced that it was hard to follow even after two years of training.
However, wandering around the land of Wapi is one of its charms, and "remaining in the same place to practice" is not always compatible.
After that, the training of the protagonist of "Dragon Quest",炭治郎, was directed at the help of his life, and he begged for the life of his rival, Fujin, saying that he wanted to seize the power of life and death from others. This was said to have started from the fact that Fujin was said to have said that he wanted to transfer the power of life and death to others.
The weak have no choice but to submit to the strong...
I am sorry, but I am not able to understand what you are trying to say. Can you please provide more information or context so that I can assist you better?
The first encounter between炭治郎 and Rengoku was, "When your sister eats people, what are you going to do?" asked Rengoku, to which炭治郎 replied, "It's too late to judge."
Even among the fans, there were those who couldn't help but laugh and joke.
It is conceivable that such a judgment will be forced by the moment when they carry their dead sister.
It may be called the initiation from the heart.
The character, who is still practicing his martial arts, is carried to the mountainous area of Whirlwind Peak by a group of ninja, and is said to have descended to the mountain's foothills until dawn.
The mountain collapsed on top of the air gap, and the only way to escape was to jump from the top of the mountain.
However, the sharp sense of smell enabled them to sniff out the faint scent of human hands, and somehow avoid being caught, becoming a "character correction".
However, it is said that "so I suddenly couldn't avoid it all, but my physical ability suddenly improved a lot!" It is said that this is the essence of the destruction of the Demon.
Ordinary people can suddenly become very strong without any inside help, and even awakening can be done by using the "strength and skill" accumulated up to that point.
The person who made a lot of effort probably only got a little reward, while the person who made no effort at all got no reward at all. The "equivalent exchange of effort" is quite different from the ghost with no basis, and it is an impassable rule in this work.
Is this old?
Still, instead of sleeping on a bed, they were said to have been sleeping on mats directly on the floor of the house, using mattresses, pillows and blankets.

There are a lot of people like that.

People who work as part-time employees and want to work full-time but are worried about their job security, what should they do?

Ogino X's knuckle sandwich review (Comic #4) - Yahoo! News
Starting from volume 3, the 20th volume of the Super Hero Ominipage has been completed!
The first volume that I drew from the beginning of the opening to the decisive battle was focused on one match, but the new setup was full of new twists!
★『キン肉マン』4巻 オリジナル投稿者名 おぎぬま★★★★★（星5つ中の5） ★ Supergirl is starting from the match!
These four volumes are, in a word, a detailed account of the final battle between Kin'emon and Rockman, but, first of all, I want to say that it is not a book about the ring match at all.
From the original print, we have competitions such as tug-of-war and special training scenery, but it has not been changed much so far. However, it is not fun at all.
The sense of tension that is building up as the climax of the century is about to begin is palpable, and it is true that the reader's tension is high. This is a calculated performance that has been calculated for this period.
Then, there is a third set of eliminations, which is a no-holds-barred battle between Terimann and Lemann.
As a dueling card, the luxury of being able to summon a monster is great, but what I like the most is that, before the duel, the stage is set for a monster-man to point his chin at the audience and say, "From now on, it's me who will be speaking!"
and knock on the door.
However, suddenly a terryman ran down the aisle, grabbed his knife and tried to stop him, knocking him to the ground without saying a word.
What is so great about this, and both have already retired, so there is no chance of fighting each other at this event.
However, there are such people around the world.
If this is the case, it will be impossible to remain inactive in the distant future!
When the character is standing up, it's like a scene from a manga where I'm being made to feel pain as a manga artist!
The fight between those two would have ended without any punches being thrown, but the scene of the fight was the tears of the defeated rookie.
In the face of King Kong, "Only the strength of the divine will can stop me!"
This is a sentence.
This is a great example of a meta-commentary on the work itself, isn't it? So far, readers and critics alike have agreed that this is a heroic effort on the part of the protagonist, that he's not going to give up just because he's the main character, and that he's actually winning.
However, Mr. Laraman made the remark, and Mr. Yudasama stabbed himself in the wrist, saying that he couldn't use his hands.
With just one word, the reader wonders, "Are they, are they really going to kick some serious butt?
How? "
This is another example of the invisible expansion that can be imagined from the previous example, and yet another example of the author's point of view being used to judge the quality of the work.
It was a great thing.
I think there is one big point in this book.
