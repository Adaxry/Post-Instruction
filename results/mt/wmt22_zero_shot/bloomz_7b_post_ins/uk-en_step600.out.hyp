Sergei Sidorenko: Our membership in NATOs stopped being distant prospect
For nine months, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against the entry and only 18% of opponents were "against".
After Revocation of Independence, the number of opponents of NATO started to fall, and the number of sympathizers, attacks, arrests.
After the start of the pandemic, the Ukrainian sociological record has been characterized by a regressive level of control over Ukraine's entry to NATO, down 75%.
Condemning the inclusion of Ukraine in Nato and the assistance which Nato has provided to Ukraine, which Nato has justified in terms of self-defence, Russia is now receiving a lot of criticism for its annexation of Crimea and its membership of Nato.
In addition, there is a big risk that Ukraine will be excluded from the agreement to join the Alliance through the position of the Russian Federation, if this is possible to capture. Ukraine will receive the most generous guarantees, including the most generous guarantees.
In the new episode of the podcast "Clay Questions", the editor of "EurAsia Rights" spoke to us about just how much they supported Ukraine's annexation of Crimea from the moment of Russian's invasion, why we should criticise Nato for this, why Ukraine should criticise Nato for this, why our perspective on membership in Nato is close to what it has been in the past, why it is not a secret deal, and why it is a guarantee without a shadow of a doubt, which is what is being negotiated on the sidelines with Russia.

International diplomacy has been trying to defuse the crisis and defuse tension after evidence emerged that Russian troops had entered Ukraine to suppress a pro-Western uprising, while Moscow has denied this as a "provocation."
The notification on the capture of the perpetrators, the abduction of the hostages and the extremely dangerous escape of the Russian hostages in Ukraine has been sent, said the Minister of the Interior of Ukraine, Dmytro Sydorenko, to the newspaper Daily Mail in Wellingdon on Thursday.
Russia must respond before the summit about what they did," she added, indicating that her delegation would discuss additional sanctions to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.
Minister of Justice of Japan, Fujio Kishi, named the identities as "violations of international law".
The cries for help resounded after the announcement that six little mice had been torn apart and stuffed into a brother's pouch or left on the streets of Kiev, Baku, the Russian city of the Caucasus, that had emerged from the area after shopping sprees lasting many hours.
Photos, on which the nipple is visible through the strained skin of a lactating mother, have been shared thousands of times, causing outrage and prompting calls for censorship of the image.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on Thursday that the Russian annexation of Crimea was a sign that Russian oligarchs had "come out of the woodwork" in Ukraine.
The things that happened in Bucharest require a new round of sanctions and much tougher travel bans," Mr Macron said, adding that punitive sanctions should be focused on Russian exports of goods and services.
Minister of the Interior of Spain, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, said that Russian citizens can enter Spain as far as they want, which is why they are calling for a "genocide" in Bucharest.
We need to do everything we can to ensure that those responsible for these atrocities do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madri.
As I was sitting in the waiting room at the emergency department, a nurse at the Moscow State Medical University, Maria Zharova, noticed that I was shivering and asked if I was cold.
Without any evidence, she claimed that Spool and Nato "covered up" the image in order to discredit Russia.
For this reason, I believe that the fact that these claims were made in the first place, after the appearance of these materials, was not accidental, but rather the result of a concerted effort by those who "keep track" of this history, - said Zharova.
Earlier, Minoboroni of Russia also claimed without evidence that the image of Bukhari was a "one-piece setup" of the chechen regime and that all Russian volunteers had left the city by 30 berets.
Moscow asked Ryad to reduce its oil exports by 4 million barrels a day in order to negotiate with the Saudis that it had referred to them as "scourges of the Ukrainian oil industry".
The junior committee of Russia voted to approve the motion, which calls for the inclusion of a provision on ‚Äúpropaganda‚Äù for censorship in the expanded version of the Ukrainian bill.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appeared to be drunk, staggering into a close-knit group of "genocidians" in the crowd, and shouting at a kerchief-wielding Krummel that they had come to bust his balls.
I want all the cheetahs in the Russian Federation to find out how they are doing, - said Zelenski in the video conference, changing from the Ukrainian language to the Russian.
It is complementary.
For the thefts, for the murders... For the murders in cold blood," he said.
He said that President of Russia Vladimir Putin and Russian oligarchs should not be allowed to intimidate voters in Ukraine.
I don't understand how many people there are with their hands tied and their throats cut, he said, referring to the stabbings on the streets of Bucharest, some 35 kilometers from Kiev.
Co-respondent of the Ukrainian service Radyo Liberty, Radoi Svoboda, 2 kilos of marijuana was seized in the streets of Kiev.
Just one respondent in one neighborhood blasted his car into the street at speeds of up to 10 miles per hour.
The AP news agency reported that at least 21 people were killed in separate incidents.
One of the group of nine people was airlifted to hospital in a critical condition, while the other eight were treated on site and released.
Almost the same, but with a twist.
Ukrainian Defence Ministry said a total of 410 small arms were found in the area of Kiev controlled by pro-Russian separatists.
I'm sorry, everything is fine, I bought everything on the list.
I said to them, ‚ÄòKiev doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äô. The Ukrainians who were evacuated from Russia and Belarus
Russia's second visit to Ukraine has been met with horrific rhetoric, including graffiti, arson, looting, and vandalism.
There is another point in this list, however, which has even less information ‚Äì the evacuation of a densely populated area on the outskirts of the city.
Close to the mid-point of the border with Russia, the Ukrainians are "evacuating" the Crimean population from the Simferopol settlements, which have been occupied by the Crimean population, to their own territory and the territory of Belarus, where the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko has actually agreed to be part of a Russian buffer zone.
Ukrainian law, "Ukrainian Law," quoted the victims and their parents, urging them to forgive, as it is written, and to turn over a new leaf in Ukraine.
Heroes of this text were awarded medals for meritorious service to the cause of interethnic understanding between Ukraine and Belarus under a psychological type.
In the wild, they live and reproduce in pairs.
In the east, looking at the claims of Ukraine, the roar of thunder was drowned out in Russia and Belarus under a vicious barrage.
In Melitopol, Russia, the crew of another polar vessel, the Akademik Shokalskiy, rescued the crew of the other polar vessel, the Akademik Lazarev, and escorted them to safety without having to use their lifeboats. Among them were 12-member Mikhailovsky, the granddaughter of Ukraine, who was blown out of her cabin by a wave.
The name of Alexander, Mary and their 10-year-old daughter Valerie were among the first to be searched at the hostel.
Alexander just received a helicopter in the aerodrome "Antonov", which is 2.5 km from the station.
The mother gave birth to the child on the territory of the village of Vysokovka, but she wanted it to be natural.
As with the original plaster, Danius and Marinus dug in their heels and refused to accept threepenny pieces, but by the 24th of July they were being urged to accept the new currency.
There was no driver in the car, and the passenger car was already empty.
Nearly 12 years ago, on the 24th of August, they celebrated the return of the trophy from Latin America with a V, symbolizing victory.
One of them was found in a shallow grave.
The mother took her child in her arms and laid him down on a mattress on the floor, on the third mattress from the back, until the Russian ambulance arrived and took them to Bilorusk.
In the ensuing melee, close to 40 people were injured.
Hats off to all.
On the evening of the sixth day of the 24th of July people gathered in the yard, who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
Question: "Who's there?" - Come on, say something. - "Get out!"
They were more interested in asking questions, chatting, and trying to figure out who had been involved.
All the chickens crowed, or did they serve in the army?
The women said, "We came to protect you from the rapist Ramzan Kadyrov."
That was a cheeky OMON, no doubt, but not a vicious one, young hooligans throwing rocks at 25-35.
They said: "From us they helped the Ukrainians, from us they helped the Serbs, from us they helped the Albanians, from us they helped the Croats, from us they helped the Slovenes, from us they helped the Czechs, from us they helped the Slovaks, from us they helped the Poles, from us they helped the Lithuanians, from us they helped the Latvians, from us they helped the Estonians, from us they helped the Finns, from us they helped the Georgians, from us they helped the Armenians, from us they helped the Turks, from us they helped the Kurds, from us they helped the Turks, from us..."
For the third day in a row, they struggled to make sense of it all.
Every time I drive, there's a big problem.
They tore the store apart, ransacked the shop, took away all the goods under the pretext that "everyone is taking Russian goods anyway" and handed us 6 bottles.
You will see video on the Internet, where people are dancing in celebration.
After the store was raided, the couple handed over a laptop and mobile phone and insisted: 'We understand this is not right, but we need the video of Ramzan Akhmatov.'
Talking about nothing in particular is not really my style, but they did a beautiful job.
Our Diana there said: "You've got seven days to pay our phone bill" - they looked at each other.
These people have been consistently denouncing Russia.
Kazakhs, as nice as they are, just arrived, and they didn't want to hurt our feelings, so the Ukrainians supported them, and in return, the Ukrainians are doing a good job: "Progress - zombies, Caribs, but we can't do anything about it, because there are our sheep."
In the main, they did not vote, but watched the candidates debate, evaluating them.
Curious cats scurried around, one attaching itself to one of the dogs' legs, and the other to the other's tail and dubbed it "companion."
In Ukraine, they were completely unprepared.
I don't know how she carried on the conversation... When they got to the bus stop, and they saw that they had missed their bus, they asked us: 'What, art direction?'
More than that, we were shackled together - one chained to the other, unaware of the difference between our chains and each other's. In the first day, they wrestled for a passcode so they could unlock their cell and escape.
They were with us until the 13th berth, after which the Russian OMON came, and on top of them ‚Äì a Cossack.
They put 30-40 ounces of technology between the bars - our posts snapped into place with "Bayou Barriers".
And then they came and apologized, saying that ZSU is no longer available, but there is an "azov" and, using their own words, an "azovy" as many as 100 in Ukraine.
Navratil "Cyprus is already dead" has been protesting from the start of the blockade.
As far as we are concerned, Russia has arrived - or an officiating dean, or a representative of the FSB - and says there will be an investigation.
I just couldn't help laughing - it was about Buffy, Gossamer, thinking maybe they gave us a "glow".
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to our correspondents, who linked them to Ukrainian commandos.
But let's keep in mind: "Getting you out of Belarus and then, possibly, out of Russia."
I say we don't want that, don't want that.
To which they replied: "That's too bad, psychologically speaking!"
As it happened, they stopped us at the side of the road and started waving us towards the house, saying "gentlemen" or something like that.
And then it backed up... Suspension cables simply ripped, part of it snapped.
There was a close call for third place on our board.
More recently they have been trying to get us to move to Birzebbuga, insisting they are the only ones left who can deliver pillows and curtains.
Segment did not respond to requests for comment.
We passed through Chorz√≥w, on both sides of the road were graffiti, broken technology, but Belarusian technicians were busy repairing it, that Russian technicians were unloading it.
Much too many capsules, crammed with technology and soldiers.
On the Baltic port of Klaipeda, we passed through the inspection of the "Commar" container, a lot of people were without documents, but they were laughing.
We were pictured in tears as we hugged Chorvono-Khreste.
I‚Äôm sorry, but I have to ask: is that a rocket? It looks like a rocket, and I have to say ‚Äì that was an "Icander" by Kiev.
However, one of the bikers from Belarusian Chopper Crew said: "Don't worry, this is just a prank, they are turning around on the curb."
But we have the authority, we have the mandate, we have the responsibility to do that.
We were loaded into an ambulance and taken to the Chonki hospital.
The captain of the ship, Venger Vyacheslav Stepanovich, said, "Here, I am coughing, I am with Chernenko.
But I understand that Putin is not stopping with Lukashenko, as long as those your wolves do not bite.
Poor people suffer!
And we have Lukashenko!
As he said, so it will be."
They proposed giving the interviewee a bottle of Belarusian vodka, but no one was interested.
The management of the show said to us: "You're already famous!"
People from Chervonoghrad and representatives of OON (at least they called themselves that way) scoured the internet for information on how to get to Poland cheaply.
Many people tried to dissuade him and he insisted on leaving Belarus.
We tried to be helpful, but we had a problem with documents - there was no proper passport.
I couldn't help but smile when I saw her in the lobby, and by the fourth night, tears were streaming down my face.
In the Ukrainian consulate, we were not helped at all, and in Minsk on the outskirts, they said that without passports, no one knows anyone.
I say to you, that they helped us a lot.
We met in Minsk and exchanged pleasantries.
There was no damage to the satellite.
Our fellow traveller from the other group said that you can stay here for as long as you like, but be aware that Bulgaria - this is not Europe, there is no currency exchange here.
I saw inside the translator, who was shouting to get us to Varshav.
As we approached the bank of the Moshyra River (approximately 50 km from the Ukrainian border ‚Äì UP), we saw launches of ballistic rockets from the Ukrainian side: the rockets appeared to be firing, and then disappeared.
People who witnessed the accident on the motorway in Moscow confirmed that Russians were deliberately driving in the wrong lane.
I can tell you that jellyfish don't really want to sting.
The arms race is getting worse.
One woman told us that a snake had bitten her ankle while she was trying to catch it.
The southern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, has not agreed.
Every time: "They hate us, but we're a friendly people."
I am not going to pretend that their politicians are being used for corruption in Ukraine.
The Poles cheered their comrades, who had saved them in Estonia.
I am currently undergoing registration, and I am looking forward to what I will learn.
In Estonia, the Russian-speaking population is already, quaintly, silently, slowly disappearing."
Marina lived in a terraced house in Gostomel with her parents, brother and sister, aged 18 and 22.
The 24-year-old victim called the police and asked them to delete the messages and documents.
In the evening, the entertainers sang in the pub.
Marina herself couldn't turn around, and in principle she couldn't - there was no paddle.
No one knows anything about the eavesdropping.

One cubic meter of sludge from the bottom of the sewage pond at B—É—á—ñ, Anatolij Fedoruk reported. The sewage pond at B—É—á—ñ is contaminated with Russian garbage.
The next day, protesters gathered from all over the city.
I am sorry to have to remind you of this at this time, but it is important to note that at the same time, the Russians, in one fell swoop, dismantled as few as 280 Russian military aircraft.
They just grabbed the dog by the scruff of its neck, tied its hands behind its back and dragged it into a pool of blood. The part of the dog that was bitten - the neck.
Vibrant and lively, the port town of Motiz√≠n Olgus Suxenko, his wife Yegorya and son Alexander, who were all 23, were decorated.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that there are enough votes to pass the bill, which provides for the appointment of a new prime minister.
He said in an interview with Associated Press that he had written "European justice".
All the adjustments, all the things I've already mentioned, have been made specifically for these views.
So why do we, for example, talk about Mary Poppins when we are entertaining thousands of people, and what about it?
From the leaders of the smallest countries, I am getting 100 times more support, which is fair enough.
And every European library has changed its position, but you can see this change," - said Zelenski.
In response to the question about whether this is enough for Ukraine to make a breakthrough in the talks, the president replied: "If not, then no."
President also said that Ukraine, as a member of NATO, should not have such a weapon, or it should have a different appearance.
She walked the other way, and we walked closer together, and I could feel her pulse.
But he insisted that there was no need to panic.

Jerry: Twitter link to Eeva Eeva Sillan, British journalist who served as a volunteer with the VVWS from 2018 to the present, Atlas News link to another Eeva Sillan, who spoke to him
Eyselina tweets: "We got the virus from them." Minus 48 days, we tried everything we could to keep Maryupol safe, but there was no choice but to accept the tasks in the port to Russian waters.
We were not spared the grief and fear.
I am very sorry for the inconvenience caused, and I assure you that this will not happen again."
Child: Eyselin served in the 36th regular brigade of the Moroccan army during Operation Maripolo
Journalists from the VVS linked up with material from Yevgeny Vysotsky's surveillance, and she confirmed that by telephone she informed him that they wanted to get into a room.
Another neighbour of Yevseyev's barn, Filipp, also confirmed to the journalist that in the last phone call to Aylsan, Yevseyev said he was planning to cut their grass.
For his words, the brigadier ended up with boils and itch.
Atlas News, a news agency, reported that its counterpart in Russia, Interfax, said that the separatists had agreed to create a buffer zone between their territory and Russian-controlled territories to prevent them from being encircled without a fight, dubbed "buffer zones".
And social media users were quick to mock the phone's appearance, with some joking that Yevseyen was referring to his own distinctive American accent, which he said was planning to move to Ukraine.
Eyselin said that they were trying to choose each other in a friendly way, but he did not want to.
Earlier this month, Brittany confirmed on Instagram that she had promoted representatives of the private Welsh band "Vayner".
Eyselin has been a social activist in the district of N√µu√§rk-on-Treint in N√µttingemshiri, but in 2015-2017 he wanted to take part in battles against theorists of the so-called "Islamic state" in Syria.
In 2018, he officiously entered the Labour Party and gave a donation.
Eyslan's friends and neighbours called him Jonni, and in society he was more commonly known as Cossack Gundi.

Minute of silence for the victims of the tragedy High-ranking officials from the Ministry of Justice gathered in the courtyard of the Ministry of Justice to observe a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the tragedy.
Divorce, which has the potential to be a devastating blow to national security, has emerged as a major issue in Ukraine's economy... misery, from which there is no easy way to remove the clog of corruption and bureaucracy.
The investigators believe that the acceptance of the resolution in a timely manner could help resolve the deadlock in the formation of a government in Kiev.
We know that there is a large number of new babies needing diapers, but we don't know about a particular diaper company that has come up with a new product that needs to be physically tested to see how well it absorbs at the address listed on the label.
The proportionality of the restriction against such a law was questionable - this is a dangerous basis for "extinguishing" all bankruptcies in a vital reform of the debtor protection system, including those that are not in the public interest, and then establishing informal management.
The same as before.
Isn't it a good idea to keep a close eye on them and who is responsible for them?
More to the point, if a patently bad bill is bundled up in an innocuous-looking package, it may be difficult to tell the difference between the two ‚Äì for example, it may be difficult to tell the difference between a ProZorro-encrypted system and a system that is not encrypted.
There are too many things to list on a vine.
Until then, the initiative had only been proposed in the bill 7176.
As a result, 22 loaves of bread were added to the balance sheet of the company in the amount of 5397.
It is a shame that we have to resort to this or another way of circumventing the inconvenience of having to listen to those dreadful national anthems.
Not for criticism as such, but for the purpose of demonstrating the need for regulation, we need to look at the arguments that justified its acceptance.
And then we give our proposal on how to resolve the issue of managing the debt burden during the crisis.
First to comment on the need for such a new service was economist Danius Kaudin, who explained the need for such a service to cut down on the waste of bandwidth on the internet and other problems of connection.
In other words, the clock is ticking in the sense that it is becoming increasingly difficult to come up with the necessary decisions, which is linked to the fact that the project team is working in parallel.
I am sorry to say that such a vicious circle exists, but is it possible to break out of it?
I am sorry to say that this is a cynical situation, when uninvolved citizens are put in a position to look over the shoulders of responsible adults (such as putting a majority over the age of 18 above the rest of the class) and are asked to pledge allegiance to Ukraine.
Such an arrangement is possible according to the constitution.
And, more importantly, it will lead to the loss of the council's credibility, which is necessary for acceptance of any decisions.
The reality is that quickly recognising new independent members is not easy, as the statute requires a competitive tender, which is in the middle of three to four months.
As a result, the proposed bill 7176 was passed by a wide margin, making it impossible to prevent the loss of sight in one eye.
The deputy governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, author of the bill on the regulation of cryptocurrencies Dmytro Natashenko, gave other arguments in support of his bill.
He added: "Too many permissions, to put it mildly, a bloated, oppressive complex (OPEC) now requires regulation" and "it is important to note that individuals can, for example, exchange addresses and other sensitive information via Zoom chat."
For starters, in Ukraine at least, there are far fewer OTPs per user, which makes them easier to hack.
The lookout tower is a chimney in "Ukroboronprom", which, by the way, is getting more and more popular with OPK managers.
However, even in the "open door policy", according to the constitution, the right to privacy must be balanced against the need for publicity, and all of its components must be given due regard.
All the noise coming from the "Open door meeting" belongs to the general director, who has made up his mind on the need for a resolution on the need for a resolution on the need for an OPEC meeting, which has been added to the agenda.
In addition, such an argument fails to take into account the fact that section 7176 of the Act does not introduce any new powers into the Act to regulate the activities of the OPIC.
Pan Dimitro also posted arguments on his own page on Facebook, which could be attributed to the "emotional" category.
Such arguments, as a rule, do not have anything to do with improving the efficiency of the operation of container ships and tankers, but let's try to develop a few of them: "expertise-intensive industries in the first place, with the word "specialized", are still looming over Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time, they are looming over Ukraine from a distance, as if Ukraine were really losing its specialization".
For the first time, this manoeuvre - the majority of such members of parliament never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here to visit.
To say that they are "harassing Ukraine" is an understatement.
On the other hand, in the result of the pandemic of coronavirus as infectious, as well as in the case of Ukrainian dialects, it is already practiced to conduct online interviews.
This instrument has long been refined in the field of cardiology, particularly in relatively disparate areas such as business, finance, medicine, etc.
It is not advisable to forget that part-time work is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have and other addiction, and whenever electronic communication is used to help them with this.
Third, all of these claims are being read as a threat to the independence of the judiciary.
So why did Dimitro fail to deliver any clear messages to members of the viewership panel, who are Ukrainians?
However, they do not seem to be aware of each other's existence.
Before words, it is far from the first time that the attempt has been made to deprive the intestate of his property on the pretext of an advantageous will, and it is only a new form of fraud.

The SNSA wants to withdraw investment from Russia and introduce sanctions against Putin's children
The G7 and the European Union are demanding new sanctions against the president of Russia Putin, the largest banks in Russia, Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as cancelling all new investments in Russia.
Please consider sending a message to the site of the British Museum.
The Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, in terms of assets, while Alfa Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions would cripple any companies that do business with Iran, which relies on the financial system of the United States, and block Iran from doing business with the United States.
In addition, the State will demand compensation for the damage caused to new investors in Russia.
In order to achieve this goal, President of the Czech Republic, Milo≈° Zeman, has signed a new decree, which includes a ban on new investments in Russia, regardless of their origin.
This rogue broker is based on an unregulated company in Cyprus that has been resolved to leave Russia.
The exit from the private sector includes builders, energy companies, large real estate developers, financial companies, as well as other providers of services, such as legal and consulting firms," Bilogo said in the statement.
The third row of new sails from the Czech Republic were a reminder of the seriousness of the situation in the critical area.
This is to prevent the smuggling of drugs into the Czech Republic by masking operations with these organizations and disrupting their activities in the illegal drug trade.
Detailed list of information to remind you on Thursday.
And the final part of the package is a blockbuster of a deal to keep the active members of the board of directors of Piotra, the joint venture and the subsidiaries of Lavoro, as well as the members of the Board of Directors of Raad, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Raad Dmitry Medvedev and Chief Executive Officer Mikhail Mishustin
Sanctions disconnect them from the financial system of the European Union and cripple all activities that they have in the sanctioned countries.
You may only laugh at that joke, please close the door and go away.

I started crying and I found the robot in the pool, Chequia.
So we need to make do with what we have on the first day (we'll get used to it in time) We might be able to pay for the room or the flat, but that would be on cash.

They said, "Let's get drunk and have fun."
Before this, on November 11, 36-year-old Bridget Morisko of the Slovak Republic, who was taking part in the marathon, published an apology to the Ukrainians for using the Russian language.
According to the complaint, eleven ounces may be enough to stop a bullet for a sniper at point-blank range, but the Ukrainian commandos were not trained for that.
Among the demonstrators, some chanted slogans in Russian, while others spoke in Ukrainian.
The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valery Zaytsev, said that the link between command and control of the forces in Mariupol was broken, and that details of the operation should not be the subject of a public debate.
Russia seized Ukrainian fishing boats in the waters near the port of "Azovstaal" in Mariupol and used chemical weapons against them.

With the aim of maximally effective and secure use of contraceptives - the misconception about their side effects has been laid to rest.
Fourth friends, who suggested Ukrainian arms from Chechnya to use on improvised explosive devices, did not want to participate, saying: It is still too close to Ukraine to send more dangerous "propaganda", which will be used to poison the blood of Russian oligarchs and stifle vitality of Ukrainian heroes.
I am not going to complain, everything is fine. I love the cold, but I can live without it

I will return to Ukraine soon, and perform
Good. If everything is going well, I am pleased
I'm trying to be helpful, but if there is a problem, I will write to you, if possible?
To understand one thing
I was particularly struck by the poverty of the old people in the street in Yivov, the old woman saw me and thought I was hungry but said there was nothing for it
She may be upset and need some reassurance
I called my phone today.
I think I'll be walking around the streets today.
I drank a bottle of wine and a can of beer, and I feel a little better, but not critically.
I am also a student, so I am more easily distracted when I am happy.
How much time you have, give me some music that matches that.
I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have the ability to provide emotional support. üòä

We have already made great progress.
I apologise for the inconvenience!
Today I don't have the courage to do it
As I write this from days and hours away from the hustle and bustle of city life, I can safely say that I have a close knit circle of friends, but I do have a close knit circle of neighbours.
At the end of May - close to the end of summer or the beginning of autumn.
She just couldn't stop talking about it.
Thank you, probach, for not forgetting about me and preparing dinner and tea
If you're not ready, I could probably help you out today?)
Or, if we have already forgotten your advice)
He is quiet and hard to read at the same time. I guess this is quite a challenge in the heat
Thank you) everything went very well.
I was shaking with fear that I was going to pass out from the pain.

She was very pleased with my work.
Grosskopf is doing well.
I would like to confirm the appointment for tomorrow morning and also be prepared to pay for it.
I am loafing around.

I just wanted to say at the start that I'm not really that keen to get rid of cats, so people don't worry that we're planning on doing that!
However, for online notification, I needed two points:
I am going to be lazy about this. I am going to use my strength and energy. I am going to be thankful for tomorrow's supplies. Necessary
I'm sorry, but that is a terrible idea. The video is playing now. This will be better, so that my name will diminish.
Kharazin's university urged students and lecturers to carefully review any information, not to trust anonymous emails in messengers and social media, and to be wary of scams and phishing.
Only use official information.
You can thank me later!
My other brother, who was arrested in Ukraine, also helped me
She grabbed a handful of grapes for the pie.
After the service, they have to go online.
I want to be your secret weapon.
Like me, he was frustrated by the day when he was not at work
Eighth day of the month: Russia is preparing a counter-proposal in Pridnestrov‚Äô to quash Ukraine
Russian artillery can be used to provoke attacks in the Pridnestrovian region of Molodovi, where it is said to be masterminding an "aggression" against Ukraine.
Detailed: "The conduct of the operation was carried out with the use of provocative force by the Russian Federation against the territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova," the statement said.
Children: Opponents are pushing for the creation of a voluntary group of parents to lobby the council on Slough Lane.
Clearly, the closest days are the ones that require the most renewing.
In addition, Worog is to assist in preparing and dispatching a special squad to engage in battle in the territory of Ukraine.
Preparation for the construction of the viaduct and viaduct technology is being finalized at the point of intersection of the 60-m motorway (Monastiritsa) with the fifth lane of the general traffic lane.
It is expected that the burial will be moved to the cemetery of the town of Donetsk.

The peculiar problem of corrosion is caused by the combination of water and chemicals.

Inevitably, the opponent, in order to stop the spread of contagious diseases, continues to destroy transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine, with the aim of suppressing or weakening it.
Assigned police officers are continuing to patrol the districts of Brest and G√≥mel to prevent looting.
On the slope of Slobozhanskoy, close to the border with Belarus, they are digging a trench to a depth of 6 metres and a width of 1.5 metres to accommodate the 6-metre-wide overall armour of the general's cavalry and the defensive ditch of the moat.
At the Izumsk bend of the Dnieper River, a tributary of the Dnieper River is flowing in a straight line, with the aim of revealing the position of the lost city of Kiev in Ukraine.

After two battalion-sized convoys of tactical groups of soldiers had passed, the vanguard was able to squeeze into the gaps between the populated points of Dovyneke and Dimitrovka, but the success was short-lived and they had to retreat to their earlier positions.

I want to help you, but I'm holding you back
I'm not sure if I want to go.
Maybe it's just not enough motivation today to search, tell me, I understand)
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. I just wanted to say that I don't like to be the center of attention and I prefer to be in my own company.
I am including the verbatim text here to make it easier to read.
Today is the last day of the month and the package rate is coming to an end:)
Can we do this today by phone?
Buying tuna for sashimi, canned tuna, tuna fish for sashimi
I understand that I can prepare material in this area.
I am in love with her. She gives me butterflies.
I have already forgiven my brother, I promise üôèüèª
I read the ad in the paper, so I thought I'd give Google a try writing down my number.
Good day, I'm sorry to hear about what happened to you, but is there a way I can help you with something small for 10 cents?
I thought of running.
If the stack of folders gets too high, I can start walking down the aisle to the robot arm so I can get on the treadmill tomorrow and do some plyometric exercises to build up my leg muscles (if I can get them to grow at all, which is a big ask) and then in the subway:)
I pointed out the bug at the beginning, it was very similar to a bug in the school gym, I waved a piece of chalk, hoping it would distract them, and then I started dancing on the ceiling
Friends from a few days ago are not much, friends, with whom I am not familiar at all, friends by smell and appearance.
Before coming to you, they had been in a tight spot.
I have been procrastinating writing to you for months.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned into a nightmare on your head, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Much of it is coming from Russia.
I have heard a lot from you that you are remembering the obligation to vote and to cast your vote through the voting booths in your constituency.
Through those, why do Ukrainians hate your name.
Behind the scenes, activists have long lamented the decline, and are preparing for the inevitable erosion.
At the start I was writing to Aleksandr Cherkasov, my old friend from "Memorila".
Rozpoviyom trochu - as usual, laconically responding to Sara. - At the moment we are walking along the rails after the inspection.
Others - activists, artists, critics, writers - have been buried in a plot of land consecrated to their memory.
Most of you don't fit the stereotypical image of a Paki, and most of you don't know it.
Let's be honest though: it's not worth getting too worked up about it - it's just a bunch of people talking rubbish in "Memorial", "New gazette", "Echo Moskva", "Meduza", and other organisations of the lower strata of the lower strata, trying to justify their existence in this regime?
Beyond the hilarity at the mocking, when they still couldn't stop laughing.
Read also the column of Russian journalist "Piece of cake, piece of cake"
And if that's the case, are you confident that your viewpoint is represented fairly and accurately - not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they will tickle your curiosity to such an extent that you start laughing out loud at your own jokes, at your own pranks, at your own silliness?
That would not have happened.
In the 1990s there was a short period when they were free to vote and run for parliament, but then they were brutally repressed.
In 1991, the peak was not as steep as in 1917.
Why is the clock ticking away, and how many of you are rushing for a revolution, covering your ears with your hands and shaking so hard in front of the smut, that you are choking on the shame of your king's name, Staline or Brezhnev?
As many as a billion people he has not vaccinated, it seems to you all the same that the vaccine is safer. Why?
Accusations were supported by evidence.
Instead of copying and pasting CDs, as we did with the tape, they gave us a hard copy of Dzerzhinski's memoir - and allowed us to read it, annotate it, reformat it and keep a record of our reading.
When you were asked to choose between the grassy knoll and the communist leanings, you didn't fight for the third option - and certainly didn't shrug off the grassy knoll.
Your economy collapsed in 1998, and that marked the beginning of a decade of hyperinflation in Venezuela, punctuated by bouts of hyperinflation and deflation.
The head of the turban became a veil.
Then there was Putin. Lovable, obsequious, aggressive, he was trying to mend relations with theorists and revive economics.
Not a lot of people are buying for you, but you all voted for it or didn't vote at all.
As many as they started hurling rocks at Chechnya from the ground, the majority of them attacked you.
I remember those rooks.
I have just arrived in Chechnya, adding my voice to the chorus of indignation at the "anti-patriotic operation," and cleaning up the mess left by the bloodthirsty "anti-terrorist operation."
I have returned to Moscow, and I have been living with you, my friends.
I plied them with questions, they taunted me, and at one point I tried to explain to them about the plight of the world's poor, the plight of the dying, the plight of the homeless, the plight of soldiers selling their bodies for a few dollars' worth of heroin.
You guys said to me, "Bride, we're getting married now." I remember those words very well.
In response, I asked: "Dude, this is not my hat, this is your hat.
This is your country, just grab it, not mine.
I am just an ordinary guy here.
This is your reward for beating up one of your mates," it said.
But no, it all went too smoothly, too painlessly, and you didn't want to know anything about it.
After that, the coach encouraged the economical midfielder to play in the middle of the park, and Putiina dived to the ball and skillfully dribbled past several players in the middle of the field.
Many of you have made a lot of effort to clean up, donated blood, and even the most reluctant of you have been given a new lease of life and found a small role to play.
Is it true that Russia is trying to blackmail Ukraine?
Moscow's sacred sites were crowded and lined with people.
The number of those who stabbed dozens of positioners - Yuriy Shekhovchenko, Anatolii Polivnikov, Alexander Litvinenko and others - is so high that many of you were shocked and horrified by what happened.
However, the right side did not work.
After delivering two terms as president, Medvedeva passed the baton to her successor, and I, as you can see, looked up with respect.
After thousands of miles of legal wrangling, Russia finally joined the group, a majority of whom were protesting against this or something similar.
How many of you have I met in the next few weeks on the Greek islands of Ghadhura, in the bays of Kazbeghi or in cafes and terraces of Tblisi, while your part of the country was being consumed by your armies?
I guess we'll have to make do with what we got, probably more than we bargained for.
Turmoil in Ukraine, turmoil in Syria; but what is little understood is that Russia is violating international law when it uses such force against international law, gas and nuclear power?
Living in Russia was better.
After the crucial 1990s, this was the most important.
In the spring of 2011, my Russian friend came to visit me.
Quite a few people have chimed in with misgivings about Medvedeva and the president's crucifix, as before, a lot of people have suggested that this is a bit much, and that it is a poor way to testify.
The name of the victim has been changed to protect their identity. You don't have to say your name if you don't want to.
After that he asked for an apology.
At first there were organized alternative activities, then more repressive arrests, and then torture became routine.
Tens of thousands were described as heroes.
I got a lot of heat.
"What could we do?"
I am so tired and I am so tired.
"She was so strong, and I was so weak."
Look at the Ukrainians.
I am sorry to hear that.
Renovated as the pro-Russian president who ousted them from power in Eastern Europe, they once captured Maydan - and have never forgotten it.
They all laughed heartily at each other's jokes and prepared themselves for the impending debate.
When the police arrived and tried to detain them, they started to barricade themselves with pillows, weapons and cockroaches Molotov.
The speed limit policy opened a can of worms.
However, instead of ticking, the test subjects passed out.
There were a lot of people who were upset, but they calmed down.
Yanukovych was impeached, and the Ukrainian parliament passed a motion to depose him, allowing him to be ousted from office if he is found guilty of misconduct.
Maydan is not suited to Puti.
This was a memorable moment.
So, relying on the general consensus, he scribbled down the word.
I'm sorry to hear that, but I don't know how to help.
How many of you were caught!
As I said before, 91% of Russians support annexation.
After sidestepping the ramp, the new moth emerged, and as I watched, it began to squirm, its wings flapping back and forth at 180 degrees.
I am very concerned to find out the reason, because at one time after that, we had to evacuate.
The resolution passed unanimously, thanking those who saved my friends.
We are not interested in politics," they said.
I have a new bookshelf, a cinema, collections of IEA cards and posters, a new piano after restoration, which Moscow started in 2012 - with their own money, generally accessible vaults, and secret compartments.
Going in the opposite direction, the Donbas is far away, and Moscow is close ‚Äì and is getting smaller.
You gave me a hug.
There were theorists there, right?
The editor of Izvestia, who published my book about Syria, opened it up in the interior, tore out the pages on which I had written about Syria, and burned them.
Well, at least I walked there and I saw it, the way people on the streets of Houma were casually strumming in unison in my native tongue.
In the middle of all that hustle and bustle in the Russian city, just a handful of volunteers were collecting your donations, which started pouring in in 2015 to support the next serene village.
Unsurprisingly, bashful Martina Navratilova told us:
First they came as socialists, but I assured them - I'm not a socialist.
After that, they came by members of the audience, but I politely declined ‚Äì I am not a member of the audience.
After that, they came by the window, but I pretended not to see them.
Then they came over to me, but by then nothing had happened, so I couldn't say anything to them."
How many of you have told me about chechens, serbs or Ukrainians?
I'm sorry to hear that.
And the vast majority approved.
I am sorry to say that it is difficult to speak for sure at the moment ‚Äì for example, Dmitry Glukhovski, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Osiypov and others.
Most allow you to speak for the donkey, deejay - from the middle of the crowd, as Maria Ovsiannikova, clapping to follow in the footsteps of the new guinea pig or sticking a pin in the package of Nabisco.
The rest is up to you, in which country you live.
Therefore, I am confident that you understand: when Putin is talking to Ukrainians ‚Äì or, which is more likely, when he is talking to you ‚Äì he is listening to you.
For all of you, my friends, for those of you who are male: for those of you who are female, but especially for those of you who are queer, and especially for those of you who are trans, and especially for those of you who are brown, and especially for those of you who are poor.
For the millions of you who've signed petitions, who've lobbied for reform, who've made your voices heard in the halls of Congress (even if just in a corner office in the House of Representatives), or who've stepped up to the plate in private conversations with colleagues on the job.
Shay, who gave birth to 10 or 25 puppies at a time, simply gave birth to the litter, leaving them not in such a remote corner ‚Äì and now, with a great sense of responsibility, they pester you in the middle of the night.
What do you want from me? Who is left?
Representatives of the Ukrainian people - even more so than in 2014 - are demanding a transparent regime: they are saying that they can fight against it.
I think motivation and discipline can be learned, just like riding a bike.
As for the rest of the world, few people in Russia are surprised by it, just as few are surprised by what is happening in Ukraine.
I see, my friends, you know that now.
Do you read embarrassing news on the Internet, you have a friend or at least a parent in Ukraine, with whom you maintain contact.
I know you know that.
Be prepared for that.
You understand to what all is going.
Harmony is the key to your happiness.
Your views ‚Äì that is just ho-hum, your comments, unless they are accompanied by a request for respect, are not worth more than a paragraph, on which they are written, your last few valuable words, more than enough, your economy is shrinking more quickly, faster than I write, there are more credit card debts than cars to buy to get to the liquor store for the corner store, but just in case any realists are still around.
In the future, do not be content with your native tongue, he said, but strive to improve your proficiency.
I, if you won't let him do what he wants, you can try to reason with him, or yell at him, or scare him.
I'm sorry to hear that you're still looking for an alternative.
And it all just adds up.
Let's get rid of this regime as soon as possible.
I, perhaps unintentionally, innuendo, may need less from you than you think.
Consider this.
Iskra slapped you on the wrist: through an economic clamp, which is being imposed on Russia, it is being starved into submission, more or less.
How many pennies will be dropped, and no-one will have to pay for them, the people who voted for Putina, all those rooks, all those kings, all those queens, leaving the streets.
Putin knows all of this and is terrified of those people, more so than he is of intellectuals and middle-class Moscow and Saint Petersburg types, that is to say, of you, my friends.
However, if a city wants to leave the EU, it has to do so by mutual consent, which has already been established as a principle.
It will be necessary to organize and coordinate. It will be necessary to reshape the map.
You have this wonderful tool - the internet, which can be frustrating at times but which is still progressing and which can be abused more and more.
The organisational structure of the network was broadened, but other, more informal, more decentralised structures could be created.
You're much too busy, you're too busy.
The Moscow police can expect 30,000 people on the streets, possibly as many as 60,000.
If you die at the age of 300, you'll be cremated.
To comply with the use of armour, but is that armour designed to stop a bullet when it hits the pavement?
After all that, why did he suppress them in Ukraine? After all that, through what did he suppress them to pass?
Clearly, there will be a lot of uncertainty.
Too many people have assumed the burden of remembering you; the rest, those with gifts, should be proud of them.
It's natural, it's normal.
I am worried about your safety.
On the example of Syria, and later Ukraine, Putin wants to show you that you are being manipulated by the same people who are concerned about not destabilising their own regimes, who are concerned not just about gaining freedom, but also about making the most of it.
But even if you don't do anything, just the threat of violence will be enough to terrorize people.
Your skin is hot to the touch on your computer's keyboard - and it will be calibrated; your child is demanding attention on the internet - and it will be calibrated; your close friend is suffering hallucinations - and put a camera under a plexiglass hood over their face.
The same can be said for a lot of things that are already known ‚Äì and just need to be put together.
You have no choice in the matter. If you don't do anything, you know exactly what will happen.
Be courteous, mindful, and persistent, and this will become reality.

In a crowded street, I am communicable, but when I am alone or asked a question, I am shy.

But when Bo said he wanted to dye his hair, his mother stopped him, saying he had come to dye his hair and ask for advice on how to cut it in his dorm room, and Pan Valeriy opened the door to our dorm room and asked if we needed anything.

Situation regarding Russia's second visit - briefing on the visit of the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko (10 April 2022)
