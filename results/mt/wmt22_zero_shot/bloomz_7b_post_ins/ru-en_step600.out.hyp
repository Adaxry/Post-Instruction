According to my point of view, the program on literature was shaped on the basis of Balzac's interest.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Daniilovsky and Volkovsky.
They wrote ballets, of course, from the perspective of the very talented dancer Balletsky.
Psychology and motivation of hero Tolstoy and Turgeniev for the common people are not so interesting.
In fact, little is interesting about the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Greece: Fourth death from coronavirus is inevitable
Fourth inactivation is required in the spring or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the new injection in Greece will not be decisive, but will continue with new strength.
Despite an active campaign in Greece, two or three doses of the vaccine against the coronavirus will probably not be enough for full protection.
This assured leader is Associazione Chirurgie Ortopediche Università degli Studi di Roma.
This was announced by Die Welt on Thursday, November 11.
We expect that fourth dose will need to be given at least two weeks before Christmas," an expert said.
In addition, Waghildt believes that it may be possible to carry out the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus "in combination with the vaccination against the flu".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced ventilation can help combat the spread of the new coronavirus variant "Omikron".
In addition, the new variant is particularly dangerous.
Therefore, the probability of repeating the attack "Amikron" is three times higher than the Delta or Beta.
The results of the preliminary investigation conducted in UAR are indicative of this.
According to this, producers of BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide the vaccine to the market by the end of 2022, adapted for Omikron.
Companies point out that two doses of the vaccine do not provide enough protection against the new variant of coronavirus "Omikron".
The study of BioNTech and Pfizer showed that when two doses are given, the efficacy is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times".
This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against the infection," BioNTech and Pfizer added.
This is why we need a third wheel.
Experts are calling for speeding up vaccination in the country.
For example, the president of the NEMO association of infectious diseases, Dr. Bernd Zallinger, is calling for a reduction in the interval between the second and third dose.
More to the point, as Zalcberger thinks, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both delta and coronavirus variants.
The "experience of Iran is very convincing," the expert added.
Boiler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 kg
The Bet-A-Vib series - a special breed of dog from the company Pontoon21®.
She (as well as the series Kalikana Vib) differs from the majority of other vibes in that it was originally created with the idea of being used for a bra strap, rather than just for loafers.
These whales have a greater, than their closest relatives by geography, optimal weight, which is undoubtedly a positive reflection on the benefits of these interesting adaptations.
Another noteworthy feature is the upper lip, which is slightly curved from the inner and outer lips, creating additional shading when the mouth is opened vertically or horizontally.
As a "sneaky villain", in the role of "Bet-A-Vib", he demonstrates quite an aggressive game.
Most often, the most effective animation is a simple monotone, that is, movements that are almost jerky up and down.
When planning the detour away from the vertical axis, it is not very large, which is convenient when driving in a limited space, crowded underwater vegetation, rocks and other obstacles, which can be avoided.
In addition, a small deviation from the correct attitude is currently of practical importance in the case of loafing around in the snow, and especially in the middle of the snow, when precise and agile braking is required.
Attaining the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A- Vib is immediately deflected and returns to its original vertical.
Less successful is Bet-A-Vib, which is used for wintering seabirds.
To mute its buzz, one can choose between two modes: with the noise-cancelling cap (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It was also noted that Bet-A-Vib games are capable of disrupting parasitic ticks, which are not even reacting to life.
At low volume, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates depth and precision.
This shrub is easy to understand and unmistakable, it harmoniously combines with lush and leafy shrubs even in large diameters.
For loaves of sourdough, sourdough, rye or oatmeal, apart from equal proportioned activity and "slow", sometimes with "crunching" in the middle.
If you catch in confined spaces, you can switch to a quad bike, which will reduce the likelihood of being trapped.
Among the pleasures of his own class, Bet-A- Vib is one of the most durable in work, and as a consequence, one of the most rewarding.
It can be used on relatively small areas as well as on quite deep ones.
All models are based on the owner ST-36.

In Libya, they claim 7 million Russian nationals
In Libya, there are more than 7,000 members of the common military company (CMC) "Vanguer".
This was announced on Friday, December 12, by the chairman of the Supreme National Council of the Republic of Khatt Ali Misri.
At the moment in Libya there are more than 7 million Congolese "Vanguer".
They have airplanes.
They also roost in the trees of the city and the countryside.
They have 30 active fighter jets on their airbases in Gardabya (also used as a civilian airport in Istanbul) ", - quoted by Anadolu agency.
Khalid al-Mishri also said Russian naval vessels are "attempting to seize" the central part of Libya, blaming them for the chaos in the Middle East.
Save presence
According to the editor, Moscow was looking for a country to keep its presence in the Middle East and "positioned itself in Libya."
The “Avenger” is located in Libya, using an airstrip and a port in Sirte, as well as an airstrip in Jufra, according to the agency’s publications.
Russian authorities officially deny that the CVC is a "whiz".
Where else can there be snakes
According to the agency, "Vanguer" is believed to be operating in nine countries in Africa - Chad, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Madagascar and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders and protection of energy objects.
In exchange for these services, the subsidiary companies "Vangnera" receive certain privileges and licences to use beneficial and natural resources, as well as to set up weapons, technologies and military services in these countries," the article states.
As confirmed by the SCMI, "vagrants" are entering the Donbass, Syria, Moldova, Sudan and CAR.
This group has no significance in symbolic agriculture, nor in records of folklore, and its fighters are absent from formal lists of personal composition.
The company is listed on the SSE.
Remember, earlier 27 countries of the EU approved the resolution against "Vainglorious".
The resolution is expected to be approved by the EU Council on December 13.
Situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania is the second party in the parliamentary coalition with consultative functions with divisive elements, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting on the appointment of deputies to the Parliament and members of the Government with at least 24 December as the minimum date for February 2022.
There are less than two days left before the elections, and the chances are slim that they will pass the deadline," the document states.
On this front, the High Court of Justice of Libya has adjourned the final list of candidates to an unspecified date, handing over the telecast to Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy of the Russian eyes
38% of Russians see more successes in foreign policy than failures, while 29% consider that failures outweigh successes.
"Samples of successes - "Syria protected, restored the world there", "Solution to the "South Stream-2", "All the world was amazed at what a dirty trick", "Crimean we pulled off."
The main difficulties - "conflict with Ukraine", "conflicts with neighboring countries", "isolation from the world" - are mentioned in the study "Foundation of public opinion".
The government of Dubaï has completely rejected the manufacture of luxury goods - all privileges have been reduced to mere numbers
The government of Dubaï announced a complete withdrawal from the production of luxury goods and a shift to digital technologies.
All government services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This was announced by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
Today's announcement marked the beginning of a new phase in the digitalization of all aspects of Duba's life - we have completed the transition to a fully digital government," said Shaykh Hamdan Ben Mohammed Ben Rashid Al Maktoum in a statement on Friday.
From now on, internal and external documentation in all halls of residence at Dubaï will only be available in electronic format via specially designed information platforms.
The announcement devastated all sectors without exception, from healthcare, to social security, to politics, to voluntary bodies, to courts and more. Many commercial structures also joined the initiative of the government.
The transition to electronic government and digitization of documents began in Dubaï in 2018.
At the same time, according to the ruling party, 336 million pieces of garbage paper were saved, which amounts to 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 billion dollars in equivalent cash.
Earlier Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens two days a year.

Production and export of automobiles in Turkey fell below the 2020 level
Production and export of automobiles in Turkey have almost collapsed in November due to the depreciation of the lira.
The result, according to Bloomberg, was that indicators of industrial output for the 11-month period were worse than the previous period.
According to the association, 115,000 vehicles were exported from Turkey in November, down 20 per cent on the same month last year.
About 75.9 thousand machines were exported, which is more than 25% higher than the previous record.
And if the results of the first 10 months of this year show that the automotive sector of Turkey has demonstrated a positive dynamic to the previous year, then the results of 11 months in 2021 have already been worse by 0.3% compared to the previous year.
The reason for the fall was a slight easing of the course of the Turkish lira, which in November had depreciated by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all directions.
More than 500 subscribers of the MSB received a discount on credit payments in 2021
The first substitute manager, managerial assistant Alexan Smailo, spoke about the situation with regard to providing liquidity for small and medium-sized businesses, passing on to the correspondent of MIA: "Casinform".
According to information from the State Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in the current year, at the request of the Government, the Meeting of the Board of Directors of the Agency was held on 1 April 2021, and the Resolution of the Board of Directors of the Agency was adopted on 9 April 2021, No 127, “On Confirmation of the Order of Payment of Claims for Deposits by Subjects of Small and Medium Business”, - wrote Alexan Smailov in his response to a parliamentary question.
He reminded us that the order of payment of claims under the scheme had been provided for by the banks and organizations providing microfinance, subject to the scheme being in force from 1 April 2021.
The processing time ranged from 30 to 90 days, depending on the subject of the MSB.
In the claim, the insurer may specify a different deadline for payment.
During the period of construction, in relation to the contractor, the work was suspended on a pro bono basis, notices were issued about the need to pay the prorated liability, and acceptance of creditor claims and other claims was accepted by the creditor," the judge noted.
In 2021, second-tier banks received requests for downgrading payment terms on loans to 603 borrowers-subjects of the MSB, of which 553 subjects of the MSB received downgrading on a total amount of 9.7 million teng.
In the MFMO, 131 requests for downgrading were made, of which 95 were granted, for a total of 105.8 million teng," - concluded A. Smilov.
Pulmonologist Puryasov suggested that people with a weakened immune system are able to easily shift to the stage of "immunosuppression"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems might be able to handle it better than those with a strong protective reaction to the system
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasov explained why a coughing coronavirus can be dangerous.
The reason is to be found in the conditions of breeding the virus.
Students believe that "ocmion" was created in the head of an infected person or a patient suffering from immune deficiency.
So, when he was moved, he did not encounter any resistance from the immutability.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no response from the intimacy, he became very fast.
Clearly there were such spiky beards, whiskers, maybe even more, than stated, and their anti-tetanus shots were not up to date during the mugging, commented pathologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system may be able to tolerate "organic" better than those with a strong protective reaction to the system.
It seems that the response of the organization to anything, to any infection - is not always good.
In such cases, the organization can kill itself.
This is also what happens with pneumonia, when a young child contracts the disease and an elderly adult contracts it in the form of the flu.
The immune response of the young child is harmful, it is completely inadequate: there, where it was only possible to poke the child with a needle, it bled, as if from a puncture wound, - concluded Sergey Puryasov.
Doctor also reminded that coronavirus has dangerous contagious symptoms and the most unpleasant of them all - pneumonia.
Recovery from mild cases can be bacterial or viral.
If the first case is successfully treated and quickly, in the second case often only symptoms can be bought - all hope is on the system.
The first sign of developing pancreatitis will be an increase in the level of pancreatic enzymes - temperature, pain, tenderness.
Then follow respiratory symptoms: Difficulty breathing, choking, cyanosis.
Pain on the right or left side, abdominal pain can also be a sign of a developing problem.
At the same time, in Russia, by the end of the year, it is possible to start vaccinating the growing population from 12 to 18 years old.
Pathologist, head of the Laboratory of Genetic Infertility of the MFTI Pavel Volkov noted that this category is very active in suffering from infertility.
For students who attend school, the number of contacts is maximum.
This is the most socially active way to dispose of waste, just like composting baby's poo, said "24 Moscow" Pavel Volkov, a virologist and head of the genetics laboratory at the MFTI.
The author is immensely grateful for this article.

Immunologists have debunked the myth that people with anxiety become martyrs of cowardice
Authors of the work studied living tissue, left over from cataract operations, and discovered that living cells, known as adipoocytes, can absorb the virus.
Immune cells, located in the living tissue, macrophages, also showed a strong reparative reaction.
Students also studied living tissue from patients who died from Covid-19, and discovered coronavirus fragments in dead, surrounding organs.
It is known that viruses such as HIV and hepatitis C can be transmitted in a living tissue, using it as a reservoir, in attempts to evade the immune system.
It is likely that it can also be used against SARS-CoV2.
The biologist explained the reasons for the appearance of dimorphism
Candidates for the award in the field of biological sciences Semene Golosheykin named the reasons for the appearance of infertility and told about the ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people are suffering from this disease.
The symptom is a gradual decline in cognitive functions - over time, people become increasingly difficult to orient in familiar surroundings.
Gholoshikin noted that the most common cause of demension is degenerative changes in the spine, such as scoliosis, kyphosis, some infections, metabolic abnormalities and lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing a disease.
This includes hyperglycemia, diabetes, raised cholesterol content, obesity, hypertension, depression and Alzheimer's disease.
At the behavioral level, such factors as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity", he said.
In addition, bad habits such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, binge eating, sexual abuse, and a sedentary lifestyle also contribute to the development of malnutrition.
Among the first signs of an expert, forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a lowering of abstract thinking were noted.
There is discussion about whether loss of smell could be a more early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, or one of the risk factors for its onset, added the biologist.
To prevent the emergence of illnesses, VOV recommends supporting the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive habits and abilities, which require involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of neurology, neurophysiology and medical genetics of the Faculty of Medicine FGAO V.R.N.
N.I. Pirógova, head of the department of cognitive violations of the Federal Center for Mental Health and Neuropsychology Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of the problem with memory.
Egypt returned about 30 tons of illegally exported artefacts
In the last 10 years, the government of Qatar has been able to return about 30 tonnes of artefacts to their rightful owners, who were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Thursday, November 11, on the Egyptian channel Al Hayat, the main inspector of the Ministry of Antiquities and antiquities of Egypt Shabban Abdel Ghaoud said.
In 2011, 29,300 artefacts were returned to Egypt from the Egyptian state.
Only this year, at the Museum of the Bible in Vienna, 5300 relics of ancient Egyptian civilization have been discovered," he said.
Abdel Ghaoud clarified that all the seized documents were registered in archives.
At the moment, the crew members are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "track down scammers around the world and sales on the Internet" via Eastern and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector told the BBC that cultural values are being restored and displayed in museums.
According to his words, one of the returned artefacts has turned out to be a prehistoric knife found in Bulgaria, which is now part of the Egyptian Civilization exhibition at the Cairo National Museum.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to INTERPOL for help in finding the person responsible for the theft of a banknote from an ATM in Lod, Lebanon.
The auction house Christie’s 4 July conducted a bidding war on a set of tortoiseshells on which the age of the turtle was estimated to be over 3,000 years. The set was sold for US$5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused irritation on the side of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also confirmed that the object of art was illegally removed from the Karnak temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the shape of a god of the sun Amon, was kept in a private collection and was not on display until 1985.
How the plague entered Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively engaged in repairing illegally excavated monuments from various countries at different times.
According to the data, 95% of contiguous prehistoric sites are the result of archeological excavations of "black coffins".
They do not take into account the Crimean Tartars - and this is correct, as Crimean Tartars (232,000) are a distinct people (close to Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 million people - so many Turks (Caucasian) live in Crimea (see rewriting).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
It only unites the Turkmen language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile devices of staff
Credit Suisse requires its staff to provide bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes Financial Times.
The problem is that in Europe and the Czech Republic, Slovak banks do not provide their employees with corporate facilities, instead proposing discounts on the purchase of mobile phones or smartphones from partners - telecommunication operators.
According to the current rules, the bank can look at information on corporate devices provided by its employees, as they are used to resolve divisional issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank is using the right to check mobile devices in the most extreme cases - for example, if a colleague used it to conduct meetings with a client who was not approved Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff have moved to remote working, the bank wants to apply the rule to all devices used to answer working questions.
According to the newspaper, the bank's guidance set a final deadline by which staff could familiarise themselves with the new rules.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on new requirements.

Part 4
Last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 - was a fruitful year in terms of creativity, but a difficult one for the poet and his "ego."
He has already strayed outside any literary alliances, dabbled with nihilism, he himself, but known, loathed, criticized mercilessly, even despised, but a reading public ready to clutch it in their hands.
For the year, more than 60 texts were written, many of them - contemporary short stories, the cycle "Persian Motives" was completed, the poem "Anna Schneider" was written, eight books were published, the collection "Russia Soviet Union".
The main success - at the end of June, 25th year of the 21st century, the Grand Vizier concluded a treaty with Eseneh for the publication of his works in three volumes.
No one from the current generation of Serguéi Alexandrovich Pétrov has such integrity, he is the first!
It also meant very good money - according to the agreement, the general manager would receive 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, a director of a construction company would receive 300 rubles per month, an engineer - 200).
Funding was needed that year as never before.
Eserin was born in the womb of Leva Tolstoy Sofie Tolstoy, it was necessary to prepare a family bed, contain a sister Katya and a brother Saghu, as well as their mother.
Life seemed to be going on, there was something to be thankful for, but it was all overshadowed by the eerie tone, as if the materialization of the ghost of the "Black man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death):
My brother, my brother.
I am very sick.
I don't know where that came from.
The wind is crying
In the middle of a desolate field.
This is how easy it is in September.
Oops, I dropped the ball.
Many of the acquaintances noted that Esenin looks weak, sickly.
More and more people are repeating the same mistakes, the same mistakes.
And the reason, probably, is not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - Alzheimer's disease - had been put on Sergei Alexandrovich, there would have been no doubtful documents.
Saying nothing of those relating to May 1923, when Eisenheim by actual count was fourth wife, American Ayse Dorsey Dunkan corrected the peace in the street below Paris where Professor Petra Ganushkina (to whom Eisenheim will return two years later, already in Moscow) was teaching.
But here's a warning for poets, songwriters on this subject, and composers in general: the chorus is in the key of C major, and the melody is in the key of F major.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a terrible novel by the author with a pale smile was developed.
At the end of the 1923 season, Essenin passed away at short notice, leaving the impresario Ivan Starcev.
Surprisingly, but Esenin never had his own place of his own in Moscow or Piter, he was lodged in boarding houses, in hotels or with acquaintances.
Stars remember:
It came only at night and, in most cases, in a sleep-inducing state.
Once, returning from a four-hour hike, Essenin tripped on a slippery patch...
She collapsed and collapsed onto her face, crying.
As he got a little closer, he began to squirm, tearing chunks of flesh out of the boy's body..."
And after all, Esenin himself admitted after the war in Europe and in the USSR (then there was a nasty law in the USSR, but Dunkan kept a decent record):
I saw nothing there but cabs and streets...
I've already reached the end and people stopped remembering...
Well, and pill, of course...
I drank because I was upset."

MID Poland believes Belarus is using minarets as "ogre" against the EU
MID Moldova considers Belarusian use of minarets as 'ogre'
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland Paweł Jabłoński expressed the opinion that President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko used mercenaries as "ogre" against the European Union and is determined to return to such "operation next year."
In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, a corresponding statement was made by MIED.
According to Yablonski, sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively searching for new ways".
Polish prosecutor is also confident that now illegal minecarts will be used as ammunition in many "points of the world".
According to the website kp.ru, earlier the European Union introduced a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He killed 17 people and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they pledged to be prepared to expand restrictive measures against the republic "so long as the situation in the country does not improve."
Mining responded by introducing a voluntary embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously taken a decision to introduce sanctions against Belarus.

"Stay away from the snooze button": When a barista makes a guy's coffee
At the 2021 World Cup events, barbecue-style kebabs dominated.
Fortunately, the first one to declare his new mode of resolution was Daniel Craig.
In September, he appeared on the cover of the movie "Never Let Me Sleep" in a baroque mask and a traditional "bonv'skoi" babushka.
After his example, two-time winner Ullaam followed suit, first aiming for the Earthshot Prize with a cornelian code-barred pistol not corresponding to the cornelian vein code, and then selecting the more 'classical' option at the event in support of the charitable cause Royal Variety.
A few days ago, the trio performed together and Leona Lewis joined them.
Football player came to grab a slice of "Sweet and Sour" in barbecue-pie Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his siblings were killed in the same way.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for barbecue-style male underwear in Russia.
According to the analytics of the service, they bought it 1.4 times more often.
The most popular teepee bar chart pillows with a cushion and attached strap, main colors - muted beige, burgundy, muted silver and, of course, black.
The average price of such models - from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. Men prefer to buy exclusively pocket watches - they choose them less often.
You can also buy them from online retailers.
H&M, Mango, Next and Zara all have budget options.
In the section dedicated to leather goods from the Barhata bazaar, practically all the benches were occupied by sellers of Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, Saint Laurent and so on.
The most famous of all is the Gucci model, which featured on one of the trailers for the film "Dom Gucci", in which the actor Adam Sandler plays the role of Jerry Leto.
By picking out the pebbles from the muddy shore, one can be sure that the barrow was made from shell.
Thanks to the special technology of gluing the teeth together, it is possible to obtain a pliable tube with a smooth outer texture and a delicate inner wall.
More budget-friendly options are made from clay or polymer clay, but they're also less durable.
Modular expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhshkin warns that in the case of a baroque pillow, the main thing is not its model or fabric, but comfort.
Bar chart requires evening light, so such a pencil is ideal if you are invited to a cocktail party or a formal event - explains Vaxoshkin. - It will also work for those cases if the invitation specifies the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion for making a selection in favour of bar chart is the status of its purchaser.
The authors of the Telegram channel "Krasavchik Brammell" consider that a man in a bar jacket should at least be aware of proper tailored trousers with a lack of pockets. - The owners of bar jackets, as a rule, belong to the category of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to fancy-dressed social events, where always a dress code is specified.
Ilya Vakhshkin suggests combining a pillow from a bar cart with such same stackable items: conventional pillows with straps, one-piece pillows, shelves, loveseats, cushions.
Too simple and mundane things will look out of place.
Modelled experts from "Crusader Brammellla" are convinced that the appearance of a line of staff members on the corporate payroll in a bar chart is not suitable, but if it is about a "manager from the number of people who are responsible for this event, then - yes," he has such a thing in the theme.
If the salary of the assistant is lower and the goal is to move up in a complex corporate hierarchy or choose financial bonuses, then a bar chart is not the best way to go.
The advice is to exactly evaluate the phrase "not on the sly" - editors of the Telegram channel consider the male model.
Very unclear feelings from the vote.

Immunologist said that vaccination after four to five months will help protect against the “micron” coronavirus
Reactivation after four to eight months can protect against the new strain of coronavirus.
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolay Kryuchkov, who named the gratitude after six months, taking into account the appearance of new hormone, "very large period"
In the past, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure within five months, and for people with cardiac problems - within four," an expert said, calling for parallel with the prosthetic valve to be involved in valve replacement.
Krutkov also noted that early revascularization ensures a good blood flow to the ischemic brain tissue.
If a person had two wreaths and a bouquet, or he had been buried and reburied, or he had been reburied and then exhumed, he would have received a “grieving intimation”, that is, an intimation of the opposite sex, but not of a sexual nature,” the expert explained.
The "great swerve" warned Russia of "catastrophic consequences" in the event of a repeat in Ukraine
The countries of the "Big Six" (Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Canada, Slovakia, France and Japan) published a statement on the outcome of the meeting of the main MID in Luxembourg.
The document points out that "hostile aggression" from Russia against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be overcome" Moscow, but specific measures in the document do not specify.
We, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the countries of the African Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, and the High Representative of the European Union, united in our determination to strengthen Russia's military power and assertive territorial claims in relation to Ukraine," the statement said.
Ministers then call on Russia to "encourage encryption, use dynamic channels and comply with its international obligations on transparency of military activities," on which President of the Czech Republic, Miloš Zeman, spoke during a video call with President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, on July 7.
We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with the aim of regulating conflict in the east of Ukraine," ministers of foreign affairs of the "Big Six" also said.
Any application of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not be concerned that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and serious costs in response," they warn.
We confirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty, and the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome a conciliatory position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our collaboration in response to our common and global challenges," the statement said.
Earlier this day, British diplomat Elizabeth Truss warned that Russia would face "serious consequences" if it invades Ukraine.
According to her words, this meeting showed "a unified voice of strangers" "Big Semerka", on which 50% of global GDP is spent, and which is very clear to understand that the Ukraine crisis will have huge consequences for Russia."
Vaccine Pfizer is 32 times less effective at preventing Covid-19
The efficacy of the vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech against the coronavirus variant known as Omicron is 32 times lower compared to other variants.
Students from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong came to this conclusion, South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported.
Vaccine is less effective based on the study of the antiviral activity of citizens who received two doses of the vaccine against COVID-19.
We see that the majority of people had a high level of anti-viral activity against the original Sars-Cov-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the mutant variant," - explained Professor Malick Peiris.
At the same time, students pointed out that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the dangerous effects of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier, students from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted the emergence of pandemic influenza with the consideration of the impact of oseltamivir on the virus.
Authors of the study came to the conclusion that hyperthermia-shock may trigger a new wave of virus replication and increase mortality if not addressed with additional measures.
Minibars of Ukraine blamed Russia for blocking the Nato supply of ammunition to Kiev
Minister of Defence of Ukraine Alexander Reznikoff criticized the previous commander of the Armed Forces of Russia, General Angeli Merkel, for blocking the acquisition of lethal weapons by Kiev within the framework of the Nato.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikoff reminded that in the previous month, Hungary had imposed a quarantine on a group of Ukrainians who had arrived in the country via the port of Pecs in an inflatable boat for the purpose of fishing.
Meanwhile, later in the day, Berlin softened its position on the issue, acknowledging that the use of cluster bombs was unavoidable.
According to the ministry, Kiev is determined to acquire the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with partners.
In particular, it is about the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, FT points out that the position of the new Czech government, under the guidance of cabinet minister Olaf Scholz, on allowing the construction of wind turbines in Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier in the evening, Andriy Melnik, the vice president of Ukraine in Georgia, expressed his opinion that Kiev should not wait for Berlin to put guns on the table at the Chornobyl sarcophagus.
According to him, the previous guidance of the FRPG explained his refusal to provide weapons to the separatists, which risked the development of military escalation in Donbas, despite "compensating Russia" for part of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "irrational" position, the diplomat is convinced, will be preserved by Germany in the new coalition.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev is expecting help from Berlin in securing the waters of the Black Sea.
In Ukraine, it is estimated that Hungary "will be a partner to Ukraine in a technical sense," added the president.
It was also noted that this year's heavyweight champion of the "green" faction of the FPRG, Robert Habe, visited the republic, where he made an appearance at a promotional event for Kiev.

Ministers of foreign affairs of the G7 nations warned that Russia would suffer "serious consequences" if it continues military aggression against Ukraine, according to the final statement of the side.
Participants in the meeting also noted that they deplored the strengthening of Russian military presence on the borders of their country.

Revealed ways to return stolen money through online stores
There are several ways to get your money back, cash-denominated through online stores, and not become a victim of extortion in the future.
Experts have revealed their secrets on information security in the dark.
So, to reduce the risk of losing large amounts of money when your bank card falls into the wrong hands, it's recommended to keep your main funds on the card or in a bank account not used for online shopping.
Part of the proceeds can be deposited into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend creating a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen at stores that didn't use 3D Secure security technology, a refund process can be initiated.
Responsibility is assigned to the member of the payment chain who does not use 3D Secure, specified the representative of Promosbank.
Expert from international payment provider Ecommpay, Artyom Zeremba noted that the customer has the right to make a claim to the bank for reimbursement of expenses incurred in carrying out a monetary operation not later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the fraudster used a card on online resources that did not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be probed and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases Internet stores return the money to the customer themselves if the order has not yet been shipped.
On November 19, a member of the Public Council, Director of the Department of Safe Internet of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, Ekaterina Misulina, informed that only in 2021 were received 11 million requests for various forms of negligence: from selling personal documents to accessing personal data.

Sholtz arrived in Poland for discussions on the "South Stream-2" and EU legislation
The newly-elected parliamentarian of Georgia, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Varshav for consultations, focused on the crisis related to the border with Belarus, the independence of the constitutional government in Poland, the strengthening of Russian troops at the borders of Ukraine and the situation with Russian gas pipeline "South Stream-2".
Although Schulz expressed his intention to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for years to come, leaders of the two countries expressed contradictory expectations.
Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki said that he will call on Slovakia to stand up against "South Stream-2", which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Greece via Ukraine.
According to Morawetz, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political intimidation.
Meanwhile, Hungary supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Vassar and Brusselle in regulating the crisis.
The Sudeban system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreements.
European Court of Human Rights upheld Poland's ban, stating that the right-wing party "Right and Justice" had violated European law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court has established that national legislation has priority over EU rules.
The new government of Georgia, presented to the parliament, despite the requirements of Poland and Slovakia, did not take any public obligations to stop the work of "South Stream-2" in case of Russia's withdrawal from Ukraine.
American diplomats said Congresspersons on Tuesday that they had reached understanding with Greece on stopping gas deliveries if Russia invades Ukraine.
German officials did not confirm the messages, but Scholz warned in the chamber of the consequences if Russia breaches Ukraine's borders, and this position was endorsed by representatives of the "Big Semen" party.

The project requires acknowledging in the statement of purpose that it "is created with the aim of enhancing literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of authors."
The "creation of conditions for sexual activity" means the creation of literary districts in different regions of Russia, where there would be comfortable conditions for sexual activity," - explained the Minority edition.

Witnesses warn of dangers of long-term use of blood-thinning drugs after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yarceva and Sergey Torkarev warned of the dangers of unregulated use of blood-thinning drugs after patients contracted coronavirus and before being vaccinated against the virus.
Doctor and immunologist Irina Yarceva said that self-monitoring of possible formation of blood clots after COVID-19 could prevent stroke.
Yarceva explained that blood clotting agents are not meant for everyone, only if the patient has been hospitalized, is in a nursing home and has complications.
The doctor prescribed anticoagulants (blood thinners that prevent blood clots) on the basis of the patient's symptoms.
She said there was an epidemic of diarrhea going on at the moment - everyone is peeing a lot and getting intestinal problems on top of that.
Head of the Department of Preventive Medicine of the Ural Federal University, academic supervisor of the Association of specialists in preventive medicine, doctor of medical sciences Sergey Torkarev in the evening with URA.RU spoke about the fact that inconsistently used anticoagulants are often used in Russia and are often used in the treatment of coronavirus infection.
According to the doctor Torkarev, citizens are giving unsolicited advice on the Internet and starting to engage in cyberbullying.
There are people like that who start taking anticoagulants for their own decision a week before their next appointment.

Our money is being spent on the construction of a cathedral on the site of a former quarry, costing £20 million
Sanchez, who found money in a trash can at a church in Texas, pays the fine.
The Crime Stoppers of Houston released the information in a press release.
The incident occurred in a crowded cathedral in the city of Leeuwarden, where priest Joël Ostin is scheduled to officiate, warning that consecrated Christians are waiting for glory and growth.
In November 2021, Sanhedrin Judge Djastin Kolli remodeled one of the cathedral's sacristies and discovered thousands of packages stuffed with money and cigarettes under the floorboards.
He handed over the key to the church and, according to his words, did not receive even gratitude from Ostarina.
I wanted to hear how he would say it: "You know, Jaz, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," he said, according to KPRC-TV.
It appears that the knot was tied around a tree, which occurred in the churchyard of Leicestershire village a century ago.
At that time, about 200 billion dollars' worth of assets were missing, including 400 billion dollars in the form of checks stored in the cathedral safe.
Money was confiscated, so the church did not impose any penalties.
Nevertheless, the information about the perpetrators was revealed, amounting to 25 billion dollars.
Zastin Kouli was unable to claim the amount as he had already expired the grace period.
Despite this, non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, at one time allocating five million dollars in prizes and earning another 20 million dollars in donations from the church of Lewicku, decided to reinstate the integrity pledge.
He will receive 20 billion dollars.
Earlier it was reported that the police asked the bar owner Djöla Östig about the money found in the lane of the church of Leygvud.

In China, a new case of human infection with the swine flu virus has been confirmed
New case of human infection with avian influenza H5N6 highly pathogenic strain has been confirmed in China.
This was reported by radio station RTHK with a link to a notification from the Hong Kong Organ Donation and Transplantation Service.
The 68-year-old resident of the urban area of Huaychizhu in the southern province of Gannan was infected with the disease.
His condition is being evaluated medically as critical.
The first human infection with the H5N6 subtype of the avian influenza virus in the world was recorded in May 2014 in the southern province of Sychuan.
There have been 53 such cases in the country.
In Brazil, citizens are required to declare a passenger's vaccination status when entering the country
In Barbados, it is mandatory for travellers entering the territory of the state to be vaccinated with a Covid vaccine, the appropriate decision was taken by the Supreme Court of Barbados (STF) Luis Roberto Barrozo.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens freed from deprivation of their certificates of citizenship after the deprivation of their civil rights.
In the list of exceptions, too, are people arriving from countries where there is a lack of vaccination.
The situation is even more serious if one takes into account that Brazil is a popular destination for hosting new-age, carnival-like and carnival-like celebrations, as well as other events, which implies an increase in the flow of tourists, noted Barrozu.
Previously, the government of Barbados mandated that unvaccinated travelers to the island adhere to a five-day quarantine.
Unveiled scheme to fully protect against Covid 19
The virologist, doctor of medical sciences, academician of sciences of Russia Anatoly Altshtein, in an exclusive interview with Ura.ru, revealed the scheme of full protection against coronavirus infection.
According to his words, this can be achieved by introducing an injection and applying back-pressure.
Interleukins are formed in large quantities when antibodies are injected intranasally. Injecting the virus into the body does not cause infection.
Immunoglobulin A protects the lining of the respiratory tract, so the virus cannot penetrate the organ.
Inside us, after vaccination, the most is formed of antibodies G (antigen).
And if you enter both strands, you'll get a lot of immunoglobulin A and G. But until there's a decision on double vaccination," the doctor said.
Principal epidemiologist at Urovo, Dr Sergey Torkarev, a medical scientist, said that the main advantage of applying back-up ventilation in addition to infection control is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help ensure the system is protected in such a case.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Moscow region, Dmitry Mikheyev, said that the new variant of the COVID-19 virus will lead to the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, exactly such a picture is observed in other countries, where the next outbreak of pandemics came earlier.

I had a chat with the cobbler (who has been there a long time) about it - if you're prepared to change the dull house, the squeaky floorboards, the leaky roof, the love and the games into something lively, then go ahead.

Voz found "immigration" already in six decades of states
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the new strain of the coronavirus, known as "Imicron", has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new variant could have catastrophic consequences.
The spread of the virus was described in a statement by the WHO.
According to the organization, on September 9, the virus had already been detected in 63 countries, in all six regions of the WHO.
This is because it has only been actively spreading since the end of November.
Voz also expressed concern about the spread of the new variant at a high temperature.
Experts at the WHO expressed concern that the new strain, based on preliminary data, may be able to overcome the "delta" strain, which is the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Until this point, the Director of the General Directorate for Healthcare of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had stated that the mutation of the virus was capable of causing a significant impact on the course of the pandemic.
Similar conclusions were reached in the UK as well.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that in the next few months, "immuno-compromised" patients will become "dilated".
The number of people injured only in Bulgaria amounts to around 1 million. This is due to the fact that officially "oligarchic" in the current situation in Korolevsk, Bulgaria, amounts to several tens of thousands of people, according to the assessment data to 10 million.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the smog "epidemic", and more than 2 million people will be evacuated from their homes in hospitals every day.
The British system of health care will struggle to cope.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to the latest studies, the efficacy of the vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech against the variant known as "Imicron" is 32 times lower than other versions of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian "Sputnik V" vaccine reacts to the "Imikron", but this will become clear in the near future.
The Center for the Name of Gamaliel has only recently participated in the trial of the Russian vaccine on the hamster "Imicron".

Russia warns of new system of mercenaries
Cybercriminals have started looking for new ways to extort money through messages.
This is reported by "Informer" with a link to experts.
According to the director of the company Ivideon, Zurab Abubulatimova, the main danger, which is related to the spread of video communication means, are scammers.
In this case, a memorial video is created using footage from actual recordings with the participation of the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to reproduce the peculiarities of the behavior of any person in detail.
Abbulatimov added that scammers can ring a landline with a prank call pretending to be a friend or create a ringtone with a person's voice for spam.
"Such attachments can simply reinforce bullying, as the victimised bully can place people in vulnerable, dangerous or manipulative subcultures," an expert said.
Systemic intruder Varonis Alexander Vetchkov also noted that psychologically people are more likely to trust others when they see them.
He pointed out that this could create specific risks when it comes to technologies that use video.

Doctor Pavlova talked about the "miserable day out" of trainee doctors
Several factors can contribute to the deterioration of self-esteem
The reason for the decline in self-control after working long hours is often referred to as "mindless wandering", a well-known psychologist and a medical doctor, a member of the faculty of the Faculty of Medical Sciences of the University of Munich, an academic leader of the Department of Systemic Medicine of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine of the University of Zurich, and an academic leader of the Department of Clinical Medicine of the Systemic Medicine Clinic of Dr. Pavlov in his own telegram channel.
According to her words, especially those of hard-working goats, which often suffer from this disease, in which the facial muscles are observed to be enlarged, flexibility and weakness.
Doctor Pavlova noted that aside from the lingering effects of the hangover, there are enough objective reasons for a negative reaction of the body to changes in conditions.
Our lives are changing in a fundamental way.
"Sleep for a long time, stay in bed all day, probably gain more weight and lose less," the doctor argued. - Due to a lack of coffee, a small bump starts to form.
Because of the transfer and shortage of water - tension and fragility."
Additional role is played by late addition.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction that is called jet lag.
She emerges from passers-by, who collide into her for several minutes.
In order to determine which of the factors plays the most decisive role in reducing self-esteem, Pavlova recommended monitoring what is changing the most.

Students of the UAR expressed low effectiveness of the vaccine Pfizer against "microorganisms"
In the UAR, it was claimed that the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against “microorganisms” was low
Students from the East African nation conducted the study and reported on the low effectiveness of the vaccine against the coronavirus.
According to the estimates, he (the level of neurotoxicity "immunosuppression") corresponds (level) to the effectiveness of vaccination in 22.5% against infection with symptoms, for which... there is concern about the ability of vaccination to protect against infection - it is said in the text of the study published on the portal MedRxiv.
In the meantime, specialists have clarified that the drug can help reduce the severity of the disease.
Earlier, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, genetic analysis and experimental medicine showed that the mutation of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 could trigger a new wave of pneumonia in Britain with more frequent hospitalisations than a year ago.
How many hidden sugars in common products?
Salad - not the best source of nutritious foods.
Its waste can lead to diabetes of the second type, as well as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
Customers should be aware that hidden sugars can be indicated by the use of a code word - an ingredient, a calorie equivalent, a composition or a glycemic index.
On the card, several dozens of names can be presented, in fact, referring to sharks.
One of the most widely distributed and commonly encountered names - glaucoma and cataract.

These are all simple veins that relate to the mono- and diaphram, and they can be found not only in conduit vessels, but also in capillaries, veins, arteries, etc.
As stated in Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce the consumption of salt is to use targeted and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to taste and variety of salt names.
Shrimp of different varieties differ in taste, but as long as it is an ingredient in the product - shrimp or crab, raw or cooked, edible or inedible - it is still shrimp.

Cancller Greece Sholtz: Gas loss is a threat to FGR after 25 years
New Chancellor of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, said that the import of goods is losing importance for the economy of Germany, as the country continues to transition to decarbonization.
According to his words, Georgia plans to completely abandon coal, oil and gas by 2045, becoming a carbon-neutral country.
In other words, after 25 years the world will be such that the question of transporting people across the Strait of Gibraltar and Europe will play a secondary role, said Cancller.
Sholtz noted that Hungary is continuing to insist that Ukraine transport Russian natural gas, even though at this time that resource is of critical importance for energy transition.
He recalled that Hungary and Slovakia had made a declaration, in which it was stated that Belarusian side supports the energetic transformation of Ukraine.
Earlier, the Minister of Defense of Georgia, Annalena Berboza, said that the process of certification of the gas pipeline "South Stream-2" continues.
According to the ministry, within the framework of the negotiations and discussions on the energy agreement, it was stated that the European law should be applied to the energy projects.
Diplomat also said that the transit corridor "does not comply with the requirements" of the Eurasian Economic Union.

Most voters in New Caledonia voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third regatta, which was held on December 12, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the partial results announced on Friday, December 12, in the evening, most residents of New Caledonia voted against independence during the referendum.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results, published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) of those voting in New Caledonia voted for independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against it.
Yavka made up 43.90% of the vote, and more than 80 thousand residents of New Caledonia took part in the selection.
Commenting on these provisional results, the agency France Presse said that "the choices made did not leave room for doubt," as independent candidates had been excluded from the vote.
As initiators of the referendum, they took the position that it should not be held on December 12, arguing that the new variant of COVID-19 on the archipelago makes it impossible to carry out a fully fair and "honest" referendum.
As a result, the non-participation opened the way to the third defeat of the nearest rivals of French New Caledonia after the referendums, held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted for independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
As stated by the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and are protesting them in OMON.
As reported on Thursday, December 12, in Elysee, President of France Emmanuel Macron is expected to make a statement on the outcome of this meeting.
The theme of independence New Caledonia, on the other hand, has been awaiting a presidential campaign in France for the last few days.
Several candidates in the presidential race have said they would like the territory to remain part of France as it is "the last region of the European Union in the Pacific Ocean".
New Caledonia must remain French," repeated Eric Zemmour.
The same statement was made by candidate from the Republic of Belarus Valeri Pevress, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October calling on Cardon to stay French.
On the other hand, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not be taking a position, "because it is not his responsibility."
Still, the president added: "France would have been less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Minister of the Interior Jan Kastelec, on the other hand, expressed a "strong desire that the choice of candidates should be a choice of France."

I am a little... a lot annoyed, really.
Thank you for not blocking my channel.

Turkey experienced the first in the world drone strike with laser ammunition
In Turkey, successful trials of the first drone in the world equipped with lasers have taken place.
The BPL "Eren" was tested at ranges from 100 to 500 meters, "MIR24" reports.
The device is capable of destroying dangerous objects at a distance using laser.
The maximum height of the flight of the bride reaches 3 thousand meters.
After completion of the corresponding trials, BPLA is expected to proceed to the procurement of turreted warships, which will be used to destroy disruptive devices without attracting saboteurs.
The agency points out that Turkey is among six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

Readers of the Wall Street Journal criticized the article on relations between Russia and Slovakia
Readers of The Wall Street Journal critiqued a column by professor Kristof Erhardt, in which he described his view of relations between Russia and Slovakia.
The author of the materials expressed concern that Ukraine is being dragged into a quagmire in Russia.
In his article, he assured readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and accepted a series of provocative statements at the address of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of the speech, Harteveld called on the countries of the South to "form a united front against Russia."
Readers of the Wall Street Journal expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
In this article there is a lot of useless information," - concludes RIA Novosti commentary on one of the readers.

Ukraine begins production of reactive anticoagulants for new population
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish shipyard, they are starting to create reactive, multi-purpose launch vehicles (MPLV) of the ANKA type.
This was announced by the Office of the President of Ukraine on November 11.
This means that they are capable of acting against obstructing objects, and against other dangerous objects.
Even against airplanes.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the turkish aircraft: the fuselage and suchlike," - quotes Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main characteristics of the ANKA equipment, Arestovich said that the matter was about reactive, not explosive, BPPs.
According to him, this is a new generation of unmanned vehicles after Bayraktar, which surpasses it "by all characteristics".
The first party of the BPL should be held at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
Lethal device ANKA was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
Development of the unmanned vehicle was led by Turks in collaboration with a number of common companies.
Ukrainian Gen. Shtaysh has sealed data on the use of Bayraktar and Javelin rocket complexes by combined forces during military operations in Donbas.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky informed that construction of the wall has begun in the country in preparation for modernization of the military.
According to his words, Ukraine intends to apply tariffs.

The press service of the office of the Ukrainian legislator named this memorandum "a significant step forward".
Two luggage bags fell out of the container at the airport
At Changi Airport in Singapore, passengers were evacuated.
The Straits Times reports on this.
Two chimpanzees were successfully selected from the container with the family of macaques, arriving on one of the aircraft.
The publication notes that it is not known which country they were taken from and where they were headed.
One of the barges sank into the cargo container.
They were unable to escape from it due to the installed protective net.
The confrontation ended after members of the organization Mandai Wildlife Group arrived at the airport, demanding the return of all Sinagur snakes.
They debrided the leg wounds using a tourniquet and planned to take them to a caring institution.
Earlier it was reported that in Pnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a left-handed woman had run away from her husband and was wandering the streets of the city.

Specialists warn of risk of bowel cancer from vitamin B9
Studies suggest that a deficiency of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can cause birth defects.
The Daily Express warned of this.
According to specialists, there are weak evidence that people who do not suffer from a lack of folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dosage in the opposite direction contributes to the growth of reproductive cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietitian Bet Kitchin advises keeping an eye on the amount of folic acid needed over the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of a crash increases only in the case of a significant deviation from this number in either direction.
Kittens are advised not to take vitamine B9 supplements without a doctor's recommendation, always follow dosage instructions and avoid grape juice and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier this year, a consultant on nutrition, Rainee File, dubbed the "poisonous vegetables" diet, which she claimed slows down the aging process.

In the Balkan country of Bulgaria, due to the outbreak of swine fever, it is possible to measure about 75 thousand people
Predictions for British students suggest that because of the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in the next five months in England, as many as 75 per cent of people could be infected if no restrictions are imposed on the winter.
The Guardian newspaper reported on the study, citing experts from LSHTM, with a link.
According to the most optimistic experts' forecast, specialists, who are part of the scientific consortium for exceptional situations in the British Cabinet of Ministers, will be stationed in the country by April 2022 to set up not less than 25,000 potential sources of funding due to sham mortgages, and a total of around 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the same time, more than 2,000 babies will be vaccinated every day.
Serious measures to fight the coronavirus may need to be taken to prevent a collapse of the national health service if the UK variant proves more transmissible than the Delta variant, and existing vaccines cannot be excluded, mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM said.
Earlier, the Agency for Safety in Healthcare of the British Virgin Islands informed that if the speed of spread of the omink-chlamydia remains at a low level, about 1 million cases of infection will be detected at the end of the year in the country.
At the same time, in mid-December, the storm Ophir may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, a total of 1898 cases of infection with the respiratory syncytial virus have been detected in the Balkan region, of which 633 have been confirmed in the last few days.
On December 9, the head of the British Mining Association, Sadiq Javid, indicated that this indicator could already reach 10 cases.

Call for superyachts to rise in the world
Construction of superhighways this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce urban gridlock and fighting climate change.
In the global registry of courts, the number of applications for divorce amounted to 1,200 - four times more than in the previous year.
In an effort to combat the consequences of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine the number of people who would be willing and able to pay $50 billion or more for a flying car not decreasing, writes "Gardian".
But it gets worse.
This year, orders were 25% higher than in the previous year.
Brokers say it has not happened on the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many people who can afford to let you have an abortion are fearful of being sued for negligence and prefer to hide from the public out of shame.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If these people used to walk into the office and mingle with partners in business on a personal level, the vast majority of them now work remotely, and face-to-face meetings are limited to necessity.
Broker Iliy Cristev told the newspaper that Versace are taking bookings for new yachts in 2025 and later.
This means that customers are prepared to pay more just to have their orders ready by the time they arrive.
People just want freedom, and the super-rich can help you get it, he says.
In the remote community, many criticize such behavior and call it decadent.
Godless people, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of scarcity long-distance travel in space, life on a hamster wheel or flying on one's own aircraft elicits indignation from the community because Elysium does not want to share responsibility for the change in climate with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and propose introducing new taxes and rules for super-rich individuals, though they understand it will be very difficult to implement such a mobility.
Between the two, it only prints the number of orders, but also their characteristics.

American students identified the amount of junk mail in a week that increased the risk of developing cancer.
The Daily Express is writing about it.
Specialists came to the conclusion that the use of four or more portions of sugary snacks a day is linked to an increased risk of developing obesity.
Meanwhile, the probability of developing the disease increases with the increase of the number of used saliva samples.
In addition, men who smoke moderately are more likely to develop a bladder cancer than women.
The exact reason for the development of such an oncology is difficult to determine, noting only that certain factors lead to the process of tumorigenesis.

Ukraine prepares for war with Russia
Ukraine and Russia will "torment" each other over Ukraine's inclusion in the Nato, analyst Alexander Kochetkov claimed in his article for the "Glavreda" weekly.
He believes that in the near future, Vientiane and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations on the issue of guarantees for the Member States of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in relation to Ukraine's non-entry into the Eurasian Economic Union, despite the words of the American ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Jo Biddena, calling for countries to "go where it suits them."
If you are offered something that is inherently unacceptable, for example, buying a close relative in sexual labour, you will not be trading, but simply walking away from the proposer.
In relation to Ukraine, the analyst wrote, "there is a trade."
Kochetkov added that Russia does not intend to attack Ukraine, but is striving for dialogue with Kiev.
Preparation is being done covertly, quickly and immediately transitioning to disruptive actions, rather than waiting for a group to be discovered and exposed, he noted.
Kuwait stimulates development of maritime transport
Upcoming Chinese technologies have attracted attention from companies from the Czech Republic, Hungary, France and other countries at the International Logistics and Manufacturing Equipment Exhibition in China 2021, which is currently being held in the city of Zhuhai, the province of Guangdong / Central China.
The main technologies developed by the company CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, noted the representative of the company Hu Chazaon.
High-speed trains, criss-crossing the rail line between China and Laos, which was introduced into operation at the beginning of this month, have already been equipped with technology that provides increased safety and operational efficiency for the lower part of the vehicle.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its export of liquefied natural gas vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are becoming witnesses to "China's speed".
This year, with the production line of the company CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd, the first two-seated high-speed electric locomotives developed in China were shipped to Europe for export.
At their maximum working speed of 200 kilometers per hour these trains will be cruising along the glassy streets of Italy, Greece, Bulgaria and other European countries.
In November, a trial run of the Metro, developed by the company mentioned above for Turkey, began.
The train will move along the MetroPolitan line, connecting the city centre of Stamford with the airport.
The line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest Metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 km/h.
"Korean industry in the production of equipment for liquefied natural gas transportation is one of the leading sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international competitive capacity," said Fen Youshan, vice president of the investment department of the Korean Committee for International Economic Cooperation.
This development constitutes the main competitive advantage of China's manufacturing industry on the world market," said Fan Youshan.
After more than 60 years of closely connected work, conducting a series of independent studies and developments, China has created a platform for the production of equipment for liquefied natural gas transportation, with a complete complex of auxiliary means and a large machining industrial activity.
According to the words of Fen Youshan, the country occupies the first place in the level of electrification of steel rails and in the exploration of high and urban steel rails.
The anthropologist listed early signs of civilization
Canadian biologist Semen Golozikin, a nominee for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, was in bed listening to Sputnik when he noticed the early signs of humanity.

Goldstein pointed out that reasons for infertility can be genetic abnormalities, tumors of the reproductive organs, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that the disease of Alzheimer's and arteriosclerosis of the cerebral vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.

Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention at an early stage.
According to him, reducing the risk of developing dementia will help to study foreign languages and active communication.
Voz also recommends supporting moderate levels of physical exertion, regularly training cognitive habits through games and hobbies that require sustained mental focus and logical thinking
There are recommendations for the application of various BADs, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being debated in the scientific community, said Golosheykin.
The World Health Organization recommends supporting moderate levels of physical activity, regular cognitive exercise and skill training using games and hobbies that require sustained attention and mental logic, said Goloshikin.
Earlier, a charitable organisation dedicated to researching dementia in Great Britain said the disease is increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Medics have given the early symptoms of the disease a code name of "Alzheimer's".
The first sign of trichiasis is a problem with the eye's ability to focus, causing the patient difficulty in seeing objects.

Curious subway: How Chinese get on the subway
Olimpia should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create a global standard in the country
In China, the Olympic Games are expected to not only attract 300 million people to participate in activities such as outdoor sports, but also enable the designated President of the CPC Central Committee, Xi Jinping, to collect 1 trillion yuan in donations.
Horse-riding course Taivu in Zhanjzhouyu, located not far from the place where winter Olympic gymnastics is being held, is becoming more popular among the Chinese.
In addition to construction of infrastructure in the region, work is also being carried out on afforestation: workers are planting trees.
In the country, there are more than 700 mountain gorillas, but only 20 of them are sufficiently large to take international agreements.
In many regions of China, where coral reefs are located, including in Zhanjiang, there are problems with coral bleaching.
The main goal on the long-haul perspective is to ensure comfortable and interesting stay on the Korean cruises, so that all newcomers would always feel welcome.
But it's still a ways off.
Secretary General of the Games Organizing Committee, Djastin Danius, said that the last time he visited China in 2007, Taiwan's low-cost industry had changed into something unknown.
Every year, thousands of Chinese are sent down the slopes during the winter.
Fiona, snub-nosed dolphin from Papua, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will still take many more years to create a lively culture here, thinks Danius.
Many coral reefs are found in coastal and urban areas.
These regions still need to actively develop and create the infrastructure needed for tourism.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunli, not too far from the place where winter Olympic games are being held.
He points out that in recent years there has been an increase in the number of people suffering from seasonal depression here.

More than 500 million people around the world could be affected by famine as a result of the pandemic, the World Bank said
More than 500 million people around the world could be plunged into extreme poverty as a result of pandemics of coronavirus, which has halted progress towards universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank said.
As a result of the remarkable 12 December International Day of Access to Healthcare, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies published two complementary documents.
In them, they established that pancreatitis led to complications in the performance of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures, resulting in a small amount of intraluminal pressure in the biliary system.
In this connection, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of population immunization has been reduced, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has risen.
Voz and Vox pointed out that pandemics have caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment."
This situation is putting more than 500 million people "in the greatest poverty" because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets.
In October, the General Secretary of the O.N.U., Antonio Guterres, said that pandemics of the coronavirus had resulted in the death of more than 100 million people, and more than four billion people practically do not have social support.

Reuters: Thai Minister of Foreign Affairs blocked transmission of "Self-Defense for Democracy" by request of White House
Ministry of Cybernetics Taiman Odom Tann's appearance on panel discussion during the organized "Summit for Democracy" was removed from the video, according to the recording of the Summit on YouTube.
The agency Reuters, citing sources, confirmed that the picture was deleted by request from the White House.
According to their message, the cause was a map on which Tuvalu was separated from the rest of the world by a different color, considering the island its own territory.
The map, which was shown to the Pope by TAN, was compiled by the civil society organization CIVICUS in the south African nation and ranked the countries in terms of ensuring civil rights.
Tajikistan was designated as "open" while Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Laos and Vietnam were designated as "closed."
After the minister showed the map, the picture of her side was replaced with a screenshot with the comment that the views of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the government of the Czech Republic."
CNN was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy."
Sources from Reuters noted that the map, which was demonstrated by the Thai minister, could go against the policy of "one China" which is supported by Taiwan.
One of the sources of the agency claimed that after the demonstration, the card of the Council on National Security of the Czech Republic was linked to the hacker's account, accusing him of showing Taiwan as a separate country.

Cosmonaut ship New Shepard with six astronauts on board completed a suborbital flight
On the evening of November 11, the company Blue Origin of six astronauts launched the suborbital rocket New Shepard.
The journey, which was posted on the company's website, lasted more than 10 minutes in total, after which the capsule with the passengers passed through the atmosphere, TASS reported.
The launch of the rocket was carried out from the cosmodrome in the vicinity of the American city of Van Horn (state of Texas).
The boat rose slightly more than 100 meters, and the cosmonauts were in a comfortable state.
The rocket's attitude control system did a good job of keeping the spacecraft level.
On July 20, the company Blue Origin successfully carried out the first suborbital launch of the New Shepard spacecraft with passengers on board.

Kuwait is strengthening epidemic prevention and control of COVID-19 in cities where there are densely populated points of entry
Coordinated mechanism for profiling and control of the National Council of the Russian Federation has issued a circular requiring to strengthen profiling and control of the epidemic of COVID-19 in cities where there are densely populated hotspots, in order to further prevent the spread of infection due to contact.
According to the calculator, people leaving the cities mentioned should provide a negative result for the test for nucleic acid of COVID-19, obtained within 48 hours before departure.
Anyone arriving in a city with densely populated pockets of poverty should be required to give at least one test for asymptomatic Covid-19 at their arrival.
In the document, it is stated that these requirements will come into effect on the day when the corresponding administrative units determine and publish the areas of the cities specified in the document, as far as 15 March 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with densely populated areas that have been overlooked and which meet certain criteria could consider creating buffer zones for profiling and controlling the spread of COVID-19 within their jurisdictions.

In the MID, they spoke of a "significant conclusion" in relations between Russia and Slovakia
Memorial to MIED Russia Sergey Riabkov in the interview "Informations" evaluated prospects of relations between Moscow and Yekaterinburg.
He noted that a long-standing pattern of interaction led to stark conclusions, and problems between the two countries began not yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative view of the prospects for improvement of relations, but in terms of some perspectives for improvement, all is completely unpredictable.
This is a printout of the results of the long journey, which we have been through and through and through and through and through and through and through.
The problems started not yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Riabkov, the problems are related to the tendency of the US to link Russia to a number of questions.
Moody's downgrade added that it was not likely to provide optimistic projections on the outlook for improving relations and did not expect changes to the Voting Rights Act.
He explained that aside from such directions as strategic stability and cyber security, progress is not being observed.
Russia, on the other hand, calls on the United States to adopt a responsible approach to issues of international security and hopes that signals will be heard and Americans will listen to arguments of good sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with Slovakia.
The infectious disease specialist warned of the risk of acquiring the virus behind the counter of a pharmacy
People who have recovered from Covid-19 may develop an allergy and need medical help, so the first steps to be taken in accepting this drug should not be organised in airports and trading centres.
This was reported by TASS virusologist, member of the RAN Scientific Committee, head of the Department of Bionanotechnology, Microbiology and Virology of the Novosibirsk National University of Science Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organise points of ancillary care in the back of an ambulance at an airport or a commercial centre, but I would only do this in medical establishments at the earliest opportunity.
The problem is that there is a small but significant chance of developing an allergic reaction to such a dye, and it is preferable for a person to have their hair dye professionally applied next to their scalp.
For doctors there are special collections of painkillers that act literally in two minutes, which is sometimes very useful," - said Notessov.
According to the virologist, it may be possible to think about vaccination in trade centres when there is experience of using the vaccine.
He also pointed out that it is important when using an in-ear headphone that it fits snugly on the eardrum in the ear canal.
At the same time, there is a chance that the virus will not reach its destination if the mucus covering the virus is shed after being coughed up.

Serbia produced 2 million doses of vaccine "Sputnik V"
Vakcine "Sputnik V" is the most popular in Serbia.
Serbia produced about 2 million doses of Russian vaccine "Sputnik V", said TASS minister of innovations and technological development of the country Nad Pappoich.
In the national institute of Torlak, about 2 million vials of vaccine "Sputnik V" have been produced so far, we expect that in the coming period their production will be carried out at least 4 million," Popovich stated.
According to him, Russian vodka is the most popular in Serbia.
As a result of this, the republic plans to carry out additional storage of millions of barrels of oil in Russia.
Minister of Innovations and Technological Development of Serbia also expressed his interest in the production of drugs on the territory of the state after the previous visit of the "Sputnik V" and the "Sputnik Light" vaccines.
Director of the Russian Ministry of Health Mikhail Mishustin reported that Russia has placed nearly two million doses of vaccine against coronavirus disease "Sputnik V" in Serbia.

In particular, 1,196 new cases of salmonella "Omikron" have been recorded in England, 38 people have been infected with a new variant of the infection in Scotland and five - in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with COVID-19 from the new variant in the Balkan region has reached 3137.
Earlier, students from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted in a paper published in the journal PLoS One that as a result of the spread of the coronavirus, triggered by the "omicron" term, 75 million people could die in England.
The song warns of the suffering of the countries of the South, which are being subjected to anti-Russian sanctions
Russian President Vladimir Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov has commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of further "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "encroachment" on the territory of the country.
Official representative of Kremlia, Evgeny Tikhomirov, said in an interview with "Efimer Kanalna" (Russia 1): "It is impossible to impose some restrictions on Russia and not suffer any consequences."
The song confirms that "everyone in the world understands."
Previously, it was reported that the SSCA is considering introducing antirussian sanctions into the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Yourngton and Eurasia are planning to introduce restrictions, which will be aimed at aggravating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and Russian funds.
At the same time, board member Hermann Gref is convinced that this is impossible.

Residents of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third Referendum on Independence of New Caledonia, which satisfied the majority of participants, they refused to leave France.
This was announced by French TV channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% of voters opposed independence.
They supported independence from France 3.51% of the population of the archipelago of the Aegean Sea.
The results were annulled with 2.99 percent of the vote.
The level of participation in the vote this day was very low: about 55 percent of the Archipelago's residents went to the polls.
According to experts, low turnout is explained by appeals from Separatists to withdraw from the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to move the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia protested against France's independence.
In 2018, a referendum was held on the issue of independence in the region.
Most residents supported the inclusion of the archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 km from the French mainland.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia to be its colony.
The archipelago is home to around 270,000 people, and the territory is blessed with a unique administrative-territorial status.
Between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia there is a 1998 agreement according to which the region can organise a referendum on its independence twice with a difference of two years.

Voz thinks'micro' is less dangerous than 'delite'
The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously said that "immunosuppression" is less dangerous than delta-hemorrhagic fever.
In addition, there are data on the reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against the new variant of COVID-19.
According to information on September 9, "omikron" has been registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered anti-viral profile of the black squirrel "omicron" allow us to assume a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transmission of variants.
According to preliminary findings from the UAR, it is expected ("strength of illness" - rd) to be less severe than in the "dull" case - the technical communication from VOO states.
The organization notes that as long as all registered cases of harassment are "amicably" resolved in the EU, it will be easy or seamless.
In addition, a new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading more quickly.
In Russia, two cases of assault with intent to murder have been registered.
They were "humiliated", the Center for the Name of Gabriel said.
Anna Popova, spokeswoman for the Russian Space Agency, said there were no reliable data to suggest that the new variant was less dangerous than other variants.

In Ukraine, four plays were named for Zelensky
Electoral district of the Upper House of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has listed four options for the development of events in 2022.
According to him, the government can stay without support, and the opposition can join the government.
On this day, December 12, Danišenko told in the publication on the portale "Glavreda".
The first option, which Denisenko has dubbed the "ideal" scenario, envisages Ukraine being stopped from supporting key eastern countries, reaching an agreement on the future state without its participation.
Such development of events will help to deepen the crisis with which Kiev will have to deal in 2023.
"Simultaneously, there is a reduction in the price of key goods that we traditionally export (… internal probes and resistance to power with key FPGs (financially-driven groups. - Red.) ", - added the ex-partner.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for development of the situation - "war against all".
This scenario is likely to be resolved in the case of a high level of volatility in global politics, when Ukrainian authorities will be faced with a series of problems.
As a result of such a position, Ukraine's leadership may be tempted to enter into compromises with Donbass, which could result in internal opposition within the country.
At the end of the season, the position of Zenit is destabilized, and the probability of such a situation, according to the words of the previous ruler, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for development of the situation in Ukrainian politics - confrontation of dissidents with the White Group population and the President, which is likely to lead to seizure of control over the symbolic block and implementation of "pollution initiatives".
In the course of such a scenario, Zelensky will start "transforming the regime," added Denisenko.
Another scenario - turning Zelensky into an "overseer".
This can lead to a certain event which will become a strong impetus for the community.
The event should be sufficiently scalable to trigger a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine, said Daniyenko.
Such a scenario of development of the situation is possible as a result of pathetic behavior, technogenic catastrophe or aggressive actions of Russia, the ex-deputy said.
Meanwhile, the Russian side has already rejected any possibility of "invading" Ukraine once again.
In Moscow, it was noted that precisely Ukrainian vassal states, NATO and SCO are increasing military activity on Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of Ukrainian President plummeted to a low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest point in the process of choosing its main government.
Analysts predicted that in the case of upcoming elections, the president of Ukraine would delegate his vote to Zelensky by a margin of 21.8 percent, while for the country of Prime Minister Petr Poroshenko - 14.5 percent.
Among all the candidates, only 19.3% expressed support for the presidency.

Arrested for activism on the Red Square: "For a quote from Evtushenko, 10 hours of work, here it is, the strength of poetry!"
At the beginning of the night, the 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was exhausted.
Student VŠE was detained on the Red Square with a placard, on which was written the hash tag #PatriotMorePatriot.
This is a quote from writer Eugene Yevtushenko.
On Alexander, a protocol on administrative article on the repeated violation of order in conducting public actions was adopted.
He was detained for the first time on 23 January on Pushkin Square, in support of Alexei Navalny.
The goal was to attract attention to poetry as a whole, but now it's interesting to me, unfortunately, exhausted, frustrated by the decline of culture in Russia and also small hope to revive unknown poets and write my stories online under this hashtag, explains Alexander.
We connected with the young man to learn more about the circumstances of his detention and to get a more detailed explanation of his arrest.
How did police officers communicate with you while you were detained this time and in the past?
What did you ask separately and how did you comment on your activity?
This time the staff were more correct, the delay was maximum, the service was very slow, as if they were trying to be amusing, but it didn't sound amusing in some context.
On Pushkin's grave, flowers and bricks were thrown.
They asked about motivation.
When they heard, in principle, they looked if not unpleasant, then understandable.
Excluding the propeller which was still spinning on all four sides, everything was pretty much correct, but I knew what I was doing.
And if after the act people start writing their diaries under this hashtag, at least a few people, I won't waste these 10 hours.
According to the protocol, Maxim said, we should try to communicate at least in the language of signs.
At public and official events, they speak the language of the surrounding area to make sure everyone understands what happened on September 25, 2001 in Benghazi, or in the native language through a translator.
This protocol and nothing else, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks perfectly Russian and still appeals to help translators.

Investigators said the cardboard helped fight ageism
The study showed that cardboard is a rich source of vitamins and microelements that contribute to improving blood circulation and reducing cholesterol levels.
In the core, there are vitamins group V, vitamin C, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid and pantothenic acid.
All of these elements help to organize systems.
In addition, cardboard helps fight against age-related violations.
Thanks to its high content of cloves, it is useful for stomachic treatment, and can also help prevent hyperglycemia and arteriosclerosis when used regularly.
However, for the largest polecat, the best way to deal with it is to brush it or play with it, rather than teasing it.
The Daily Express previously warned that the cardboard could be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other products with a high glycemic index.
These are products with a content of grape seeds, which quickly dissolve on a spoon, such as spoon, mildly acidic pastry, white rice, and white sugar.

Lost film, Lord film and other pirated films removed from release "Indecision"
Candidates for flight
In 2015, rightsholders from the collective "RAEK/Media" compiled a list of 100 most popular Russian-language websites, and most of them ceased to exist, says director of the Institute for Internet Research Karin Kazarjan.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - managed to survive thanks to the regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in search results as "Yandex" and Google, one can look at the print copies of the Netflix series "Play in the Carribean" and "Necrophilia" director Anna Mikljan - the original series of the biggest Russian video service ivi (enters into AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also searchable by keyword, you can watch the animated novella "Encantado" but, judging by the quality of the video, this is what we call an ecran (removed from the cinema print of the film).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, is available the TV series "Universe. 10 years later" (part of "Gazprom media").

Estonian students will search for life on Venus
The Masachusets Institute for Technological Research, in collaboration with the Taruski Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three astronomical missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, "Actual Camera" reported on Friday.
The goal of the mission, launched five years ago, is to assess the suitability of the region for human habitation, and then search for life there.
For the project, the Taruski students proposed instruments for measuring calcium content and calcium carbonate content in the areas of Veneri.
Previously, it was thought that the Venerian sector, closest to the planet Venus, was too corrosive for life to exist, but it is likely that originally Venus was a planet of the dark type.
In the course of the third mission, the probe is expected to arrive at Venus.
Assuming we find life there, the main question will be - is it similar to Earth or different?
If they're very similar, it will be obvious that life on Earth didn't start on Earth.
If it differs, the more likely it is that life originated on Earth," - said the project leader of the "Venus Life Finder" project from Estonia Mikkel Paju.

Russian Business Under Pressure
The subject of fake news has become a popular topic this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the conversion of Facebook into Meta.
For retail, this event became a key signal: the biggest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in creating its own metadata and its subsequent monetization.
Metaphorical language is to be considered as a continuation of existing trends.
On the one hand, the triangle for creating interpersonal interactions in conditions of pandemics, because people stayed away from dispersion and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is the consequence of businesses striving to develop eco-systems and adapt operational models to them.
The third - they are the logical continuation of the trio of numeralization of assets, when all rights, precious metals, works of art, and even money pass into a numeral format.

British economist unable to predict 2022
British economist Dzim O'Nill couldn't give a prediction for 2022 as he believes such attempts are futile.
He wrote about it in a blog post for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be a period of unpredictability and any tendency can change the form.
The most important factor remained pandemics of coronavirus, and the second - information, he said.
O'Nill also admitted he did not know if the increase in prices was temporary or permanent.
As specialists have indicated, it was already clear before the pandemic that "financial miasma from central banks had seeped into the system" and it was time to return to relationships where percentage rates would align with expected growth in VVPs.
O’Neill noted that, on the back of pandemics, continuation of a profligate economic policy may lead to a new round of information.
In addition, attention should be paid to the question of productivity growth, as well as the reduction of poverty and change in the climate, O'Neil concluded.
Earlier, the head of global research at Rabobank, Mikhail Shulgin, said that positive expectations for the course of the dollar in 2022 remain, while the potential for growth will be less significant.
Among the risks for the course of the dollar, he listed financial policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of the price of gold and the dangers of pandemics.
You must agree.

Russia has denied around 4.5% of VVP countries
According to statistics, Russia spent 2 trillion 784 million rubles on new car purchases in the first 10 months of 2021, which was 28% higher than the same period last year, the Russian Automobile Market Research Agency (NIPI) reported.
To understand the scale - about the same amount (around $3 trillion) was spent by the government on supporting citizens and the economy during the pandemic.
In September, on the sidelines of the Shanghái Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, President Vladimir Putin of Russia said that such a sum is equivalent to more than 4.5% of the country's GDP by 2020.
By sales on the Russian market, Korean brand Kia is leading.
For 10 months this year, he was able to realize cars at a total of 325.7 million rubles, which was almost 24% more than the previous year.
Kia's sibling, Hyundai, saw a bigger increase - more than 35%, while sales of vehicles dropped by 279.3 million rubles.
At leading positions in this brand, and with an increase in the average price of automobiles, Hyundai has risen almost 21% to 1.94 billion rubles - stronger dynamics of price growth was only in Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes Benz.
Meanwhile, sales volumes of Korean brands surged by only a small amount: according to statistics compiled by the Association of Automobile Manufacturers in Europe, Kia sold 9.4% more vehicles during the same period last year.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Toyota's share price dives leader of the pack in the money market in Japanese yen - in Russia, Toyota cars have cost the government 275.5 million rubles in 10 months, an increase of 14 per cent on the same period last year.
For the Japanese automakers, Mercedes-Benz was the best performer, with a profit of 266.1 million rubles (+75%) thanks to a rise in volume (37 percent) and average selling price (nearly 28 percent to 8.2 million rubles).
At the same time, Mercedes Benz is witnessing a good increase in sales and average price - more, for example, than that of BMW - hence, a bigger increase in financial efficiency, - explained Gen. Director of NAPPI Tatiana Arhabadze. -
At the same time, the sales of fantasy sports indicators demonstrated the growth of the Chinese market, significantly increasing financial efficiency this year."
Russian Lada demonstrates moderate growth in revenues (plus 28%) on vehicles of this brand, Russia spent 229,4 rubles per month per car for the past 10 months.
Companies at the top of the previous year's profitability rankings are companies whose shares fell in price in 2021, specifically Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and all of them in minutes - for 10 months Russia lost 12 million rubles on imports and equipment of this brand against 12.4 million rubles a year earlier.
In the face of problems with the supply of components and assembly lines in production, covering the entire global auto market, automakers are continuing to adjust prices - the same "AutoVaz" has increased the cost of models Lada by seven times per year, the last reduction (at 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
They regularly rewrite the specifications on their products and other automakers.

Under the conditions of the deduction of automobiles, I think that many auto insurance companies were able to deduct from the premium of their customers the past periods of insurance that they could not charge to the price of automobiles before.
Analyst "VTB Kapital" talks to Alexander Bespalov about the car crash. -
I think automakers are feeling pretty good financially right now, with very high margins in sales," he said.
One of the main indicators of this is the growth in the cost of cars, which is being observed in 2021, and the prices of new cars are growing faster, an expert explains.
In the long term, the market will be saturated, and in the quantitative expression, and in the financial, but mainly due to information and complexity of construction of individual machines, predicts Bespalov.
The height of the proposal will be limited.
In the current financial expression, Russian authors continue to grow, and in the coming year, even if the growth in the cost of automobiles slows down, automakers will be able to obtain their income from volumes, independent consultant Sergei Burgaliev noted.
Considering the increased demand and insufficient proposal, automakers are now trying to get the biggest profit from each sold car, Burzgaliev noted. -
Growth in output of machinery is not expected at least in the near term, while in Russia, agrarian reform is still being debated and citizens are still not confident about the future.
In the face of a complicated situation on the market, cars turned out to be a good object for investments - a car bought a year ago, even with a profit, is now being sold at the original price, an expert says.
Bayden spoke out about the possibility of sending Russian troops to Ukraine in the event of Russia's annexation
The SSCA has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the case of "encirclement" of Russia.
The president of the Czech Republic, Václav Klaus, made such a statement.
There have never been such plans," White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in response to a reporter's question about whether the US had rejected such an idea.
Bayden noted that, in the event of an annexation, Russia would face economic consequences around Ukraine.
At the same time, he underlined that Ukraine and NATO do not have obligations to apply military force to protect Ukraine in case of annexation.
American leader also said that the possibility of applying American troops in a one-sided order for the defense of Ukraine is not worth it.
Bayden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine's territory, the SEE countries would use their influence in Central and Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
We will have to send more American and South Korean troops to the eastern front, B9 - all those countries NA-TO, for which there is a pressing obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia," said Baiden.
Earlier, the President of Russia Dmitry Peshkov highlighted that Moscow lacked intentions to annex territory of Ukraine.
He also said Moscow sees the problem in the provocative application of the Kiev transit routes, as well as in the fact that "American militarization is getting closer to our territory."
