The return of the Czech smelter is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 33-year-old Plzeň native will play as a midfielder and could soon get into goal.
The former goalie for Litvínov, Plzeň or Russian Chelyabinsk injured himself in training for the NHL in October of last year.
He was replaced in the middle of the game with Vegas and has not played on the NHL rink since.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one post to another.
Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with an injury to his lower body, the team from Denver announced at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL goal lasted more than two months.
On Sunday morning American time he was recalled from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
V AHL thus accounted for 94.5% of the shots.
A native of Pilsen, he wants to finally make it and confirm that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In the last season he had problems with his knee and in the shortened pandemic season he didn't catch a single match.
In the NHL, "Francik" played 36 games, his save percentage is at 92.3%.
Charles places a Christmas wreath on Camille's grave, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photograph taken during their trip to Jordan for their Christmas wish this year.
His wish was also published by Prince Charles, who used a photograph of his wife Camille helping him put on a coat.
The British Broadcasting Corporation reported this on its internet site.
They are sending their wishes to friends, colleagues and foundations with which they cooperate.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is wearing a long summer dress in khaki and Princess Charlotte has the same dress on.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, has on shorts and a shirt with a collar just like princes George and Louis.
Who took the photograph was not revealed by William and Kate, nor is it clear when exactly it was taken.
The royal family posed for a photograph, taken as a Christmas card, in front of a pile of straw at their country estate in Norfolk.
The picture, which serves as a Christmas wish, was also released by heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured the moment at Ascot in June.
Charles, who has a cylinder and a veil on his head, helps Camille put on her coloured veil that matches her light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbró a million for the title, which Tvrdík denied.
Prague - Criminalists are reported to have worked on the assumption that the accused former vice-chairman of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr had been promised one million crowns by Slavia Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the server efotbal.cz that he had access to part of the police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club Jaroslav Tvrdík said that the red-whites did not engage in any corrupt practices.
The server published a transcript of the police interrogation, in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who in the summer ended his career at the master club, featured the most.
According to the indictment, the former high-ranking official of the Civic Democrats was in frequent contact with both Berbr and Roman Rogoz, the former sports director of then second league Vyšehrad, who is also among the accused.
Criminalists reportedly worked on the assumption that Slavia Berbrovi was promised a financial reward if she won the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Prague team won the title in the first league.
The police body was aware of the fact that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million crowns by the functionaries of SK Slavia Praha for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
According to the criminalists, Berbr later not only met with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the Slavia board Tvrdík.
According to the server, it does not say whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík rejected any corrupt conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never tolerated any unlawful conduct, we have not sought to influence referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided anyone with any financial compensation in connection with this," said Tvrdík for Seznam Zprávy.
Among other things, Nezmar unceremoniously defames some former Slavia players in the dark and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The alleged influencing of matches through referees led to a police intervention in mid-October at a number of locations, including the FAČR headquarters in Prague.
The highest-ranking person in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
He was released from custody at the same time as former sports director of Vyšehrad Rogoz.
Drones, tanks and BVPs are larping the Cold War.
The howitzers will be new, but essentially of a worse type (the gunners will have to serve the weapon from an armoured cabin and load the ammunition manually without cover).
Auta - Toyoty hi-lux - are new and good
Dumpers and various armoured vehicles - at a decent level, plus it has already been possible to get rid of the Praga V3S in specialised units as well.
Planes: battle-worthy, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rocket - we don't have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
The forest is right next to the city.
Nutria were leaping out of the river and doing damage to crops, so I was sent there.
When I came, I saw a fisherman on the other bank of the river.
I didn't want to run a brothel, so I sat down quietly and typed.
I thought it was going out, but of course the cat got it in the end.
I let her come within 40 metres before deciding to shoot.
The chubby angler came this close to catching something big, he reeled in his catch on all sides, so I called him over and said it was a cat.
Before I got off the couch, I was fucked.
In other words, I am a man.
On the other hand, it's not a war - it would take a series of coincidences for something to happen, and you'd probably see it on a thermal imaging camera, which most people have today.
So, to be visible, you have to work on yourself, take care of yourself, and be comfortable in your own skin.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The price of respirators is significantly lower than that set by the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for purchasing and distributing face masks, respirators and other protective equipment for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their procurement in recent weeks.
Server iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and discovered that the amounts for respirators differed by hundreds of crowns during just one day.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
Why did the others go shopping?
Lenka Kabrhelová is talking to the editor of the iRozhlas server, Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and armies (I am not affected by memories of the CSLA, which older generations went through), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't have big stocks of technique that people can train on, we don't have modern technique for our existing professionals, in fact, and modern technique is always complicated, so the skills of back-up players will diminish rapidly over time.
This means that modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can get involved, will happen very quickly, and there will be no time to train anyone again.
Ultimately, backup/territorial defense is of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where it is necessary to conduct a mass guerrilla war and deter the enemy.
In the Czech Republic, the only conflict of such scope and intensity will be the one where guerrilla warfare will be irrelevant and we will not have suitable geography for it.
mainly because we don't have individual skills.
It's not the worst.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it.
To get into such a situation, where you look like a fool, who two minutes later does not hit the empty goal, and then attacks alone between two or even three Swiss, and says, "I'll show you, and what do you think is going to happen now?"
Naturally, they won't take him for an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "drawing defenders" is so terrible that I caught myself being genuinely surprised when I saw that our attacker could beat one of the opponent's players.
First swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, however experts are not expecting any major change in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, hospital admissions will continue for a while yet and a new, unknown variant, omicron, has been added to the equation, which is believed to be spreading faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course of the disease, how it is helped by vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired by previous illness.
But this week another unexpected phenomenon has appeared on the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third, and which can be used to treat the disease at home.
It will soon be joined by another drug, paxlovid from Pfizer, which boasts a 85 percent success rate from previous results.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, besides the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, have also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming drugs.
As was said, the first to be given molnupiravir to Czech patients will be in the care of Merck.
The company was the first to finish the race because the drug had been in development for a long time before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for viral infections in horses on the South American continent.
This research often overlooks the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden etc.)
They are generally less open and do not share their opinions.
That is why we Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to speaking "as our beak grew".
You are going to do a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you without beating around the bush that it isn't.
They'll tell you in the West how they love migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist.
They are coming and voting for the AfD.
He is afraid of the cancel culture, to say this in public means loss of job and media lynch.
It looks good in the polls, the West is good, the East is bad.
And actually find out what people think.
Only in France Le Pen and Zemmour have more than 20%, according to the poll.
We know that the objects are three and completely identical.
All the objects are identical because of the rotation of the units so the soldiers don't have to learn where everything is again.
One is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
It is true that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for reasons of safety or the speed of deployment because of its more westerly location.
Only the heads of the missiles were kept in those underground shelters (there were two heads in every tree).
If it was necessary to use this weapon, a special unit arrived, which took out this ammunition and mounted it on some support equipment.
In addition to the museum's horse chestnut, the rest are in a desolate state.
At the second level of primary school we had a classmate, Cigán, and we were with him for 4 years.
He was in the trip, made good guesses, often showed himself too much, but it was our mascot.
He got on with everyone, often went for walks and wanted to explain something, he was missing little, he went regularly, he devoted himself to sport with us, he didn't steal sweets or mobile phones, he went around dressed.
He went to schools in the countryside, did various monkeyshines, but he was happy, perhaps never a bully.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, cigarette smokers in the same class, other classes.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, who often had to call the police, who threatened and intimidated other students.
I sometimes sell something through an ad (old things, things I don't need) and I've sold to Gypsies many times, they always have money, they never try to haggle over the price, and the communication is always calm.
I have sold a car that way too, a boy called me after a month and said he had already paid for it...
I myself say that I am not a racist; it makes no difference to me whether someone is white, black, yellow or blue, as long as they behave like a decent human being (works, functions, doesn't beat women, just normal behaviour).
But when someone comes, they stretch out their hand, beg for flats and houses, have only disorder around them, cause problems... so it doesn't matter what colour it is, but it will annoy me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants if they integrate and start to work, set up businesses, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), and respect our culture.
If you believe in Allah, it's all the same to me, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll stay here with them.
Young woman died in a car crash in Prachatice
A young woman suffered serious, multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation efforts, sadly succumbed to her injuries at the scene, said Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokesperson for South Bohemian healthcare providers.
The accident was probably caused by a driver who was driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot car was apparently travelling from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and for still-unknown reasons drove into oncoming traffic in a bend.
After the collision, the Skoda Octavia ended up on the roof of the Peugeot outside of the lane, described Schwarzová, the spokesperson for South Bohemian police.
The young Peugeot driver suffered serious injuries in the accident.
It was a multiple injury and he remained trapped in the car.
After he was released, he had to be provided with urgent emergency care and was flown to the Czech Budějovice Hospital in a stable condition, stated the rescuer Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor injuries to his chest and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply for packages from countries outside the EU; customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He is mainly interested in collectors' cards.
Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars, where it is still worth sending, especially from Japan, where the postal service is often free of charge," the collector explains.
Since October, ordering small consignments has become slightly more expensive for him, and he now has to pay VAT and hand over data for customs purposes.
He receives an email saying that customs officials are expecting the parcel to arrive.
It is enough to fill in the data on the consignment, and if the DPH did not include the trader in the sale, the customs office calculates the amount of customs duty and transport from the total sum for the consignment and transport.
If the recipient does not arrange customs clearance themselves, the total sum must also include the transport company's fee.
According to Lukáš Neuheisel, however, the whole process is not complicated.
Close one or two blinds, insert two attachments and I'm done.
It usually takes me five minutes, says Neuheisl.
But not all deliveries go smoothly.
Due to the new customs regulations, the number of foreign parcels received in Prague fell from 60,000 to 15,000 a day.
According to the Czech postal service, however, the problem also lies in the fact that people do not react to requests for information that is needed to complete customs procedures.
Currently, there are 30,000 consignments waiting for us at the international post office.
If people filled in all the data that is needed, and filled it in on time, we would be around halfway there, says spokesperson for the Czech Post Matyáš Vitík.
Solving inflation
With regard to the title, how would you design a solution to the current inflation?
Currently we have 9.9% inflation and it is expected to grow further.
What do you think should be done to slow down or compensate for this growth?
For example, in Poland, VAT on food and non-alcoholic beverages was reduced, is this the path you want to take?
What do you think will happen when it is inevitable?
Prices are rising faster than wages, it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much did you get (who is an employee)?
This year, they added 2% in gross, which is an insult, but fortunately I have a similar income from my business, which I run while employed.
Was it someone who could explain to me why proven violent offenders are sent to prison for just six months?
I just can't take it anymore, how can a court only sentence such an animal to six months and then set it free just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
Compared to the fact that his/her victim will suffer trauma for several years, negatively affecting their sexual relationships and overall relationships, 6 months is nothing.
Not to mention that the victim of rape need not ever get over it.
Will this also apply to potential future reports of sexual assault?
Man from Kostomlat "burnt" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the grave accidentally helped the guards to secure his nationally sought-after girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was issued a warrant for her arrest.
He summoned her himself.
He went around it though.
He first accosted his neighbour and invented a story about being robbed.
The guards arrived at the scene after calling the emergency line and could not believe their ears when the alleged "robber" told them that he had made the whole thing up so that the guards would come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to ask the guards how to submit a notice to the Czech police.
When the guards checked the identity of the man and his girlfriend, they discovered that the woman was on the list of people being sought, and that an arrest warrant had been issued for her.
The case is being solved by the Czech Republic.
An honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally believe that the Slavs are no longer an ethnic or cultural group, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Apart from that, of course I agree with you, it's a shame Churchill didn't succeed in securing the liberation of Prague for the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it is quite a question, whether a rational person can actually believe in something completely without evidence, just because it could potentially bring benefit.
I would not consider such a case to be true.
I cannot agree with Pascale here. There are about 10,000 different religions in the world, if you don't count the sects.
Which god or gods does a man then choose for himself?
I'd say the odds are pretty good that at least one of those thousands of religions has a god who will kick your ass if you worship another god.
However, in the Decalogue it is stated that there is no other god but Jahveh.
Therefore, in such a case, it is more rational to withhold faith in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one from the thousands of gods and having the one true god, which I haven't yet picked, send me to hell or some other similar place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent enlistment in the reserve.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specialisations, X months on one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a person leads well, they may get a professional offer.
Something like that would suit all the components of the AČR.
This will be done in cooperation with the University of Defense.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the educational sector and industry is constantly being cooked up; companies are hunting for staff in schools and there is some kind of merging taking place, with workforce migrating from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only during adolescence, but this process continues throughout our lives; we are constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another etc.
Similar interconnection should also function between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build some kind of a relationship between a citizen and the army, that is, an institution that ensures that Russia, Germany, or even Mongolian invaders will never storm in here again.
I find it amusing that you see NATO as something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if it comes to it.
Hello everyone.
It only takes one election in the USA to bankrupt their budget and the whole NATO goes to hell.
The English will exchange us for Russian dirt, the Germans for Russian gas and the Poles have already shown that they only need to see our backs to take what they want.
The only thing that has worked in the long term as a guarantee of independence is an armed force and a population that can control the military technology of its time.
Today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled means, so what's the problem?
We do not need border fortifications, that is today's trend, but a teenager addicted to a remote controlled toy will find a way.
How to survive a crab tsunami
Did you throw gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly find yourself buried in boxes and fillers?
This "waste" is being used again by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops that accept your used cardboard for recycling was created.
Not only about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
It is harmful to treat them as single-use waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper packaging to the point of sale (the KAMsNIM.cz map of the project contains almost 150 of them) in accordance with an agreement.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste created and also avoid overloaded blue containers.
Shops are welcoming labels, of which there is currently a shortage on the market, and also savings, because the cost of label cartons has increased by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, I thereby strengthen my brand.
One such shop is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-cosmetics and eco-pharmacy.
Individuals bring us crabs and stuffing material to Popůvky u Brna, but companies, with whom we have agreed regular collections of stacked cardboard, also contact us.
We will use this for packaging shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are creating a more considerate world together.
Our aim is to preserve natural resources and beauty for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz application shows not only the collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take old furniture, old medicine, used tires, used batteries, used light bulbs, large waste atd.).
This means that all waste ends up in the right place, and second-hand items find their second home.
The map of the project already contains over 100,000 such locations.
"Gradually, collection yards, re-use centres, containers for textiles, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places which help find uses for things that would otherwise be waste, are appearing in them," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko [Let's tidy up the Czech Republic] association.
Rather, it seems to me that in today's day and age the technology is so simple and intuitive that children, who use computers or mobile phones, play games on them, but do not learn the basic computer skills.
Recently there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that students of higher education do not understand the concept of components on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple's photo application hides the underlying file system with its components and puts everything on one screen in the application.
It's fine if they use it from childhood, but above all, they should learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU the day before yesterday, and it was splendid.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, in the street – and mentioned so many initiatives that they cannot be achieved in half a year.
The French politicians like it, and the voters like it too.
Macron's supporters who advocate a rift between right and left agree on little, but precisely in Europe.
In France, there will be new presidential elections in May.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities.
The French leader also mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and that France is prepared to provide the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators rushed to criticise him, saying that Macron was pursuing pro-European propaganda and distorting history.
In reality, this is an attempt to rewrite history.
Far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is currently touring France with the slogan that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is proving quite popular with the French.
Let's take Macron's idea of one history textbook seriously and don't let the events in France distract us.
Is it necessary?
Students in European countries learn history as a story of us versus them, and never as a story of the whole.
The Spanish, French and Czechs will learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't find out what was the broader context of the event.
Film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for direction and best actress for Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival he was in the top places of the audience rating.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I am not young, I am not healthy/fit and I am not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being sick" I had diarrhea for a few days and I didn't feel like smoking...
It was worse than the common flu.
I don't have diarrhea.
(Just a personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone has it)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas double issue, coming out on 20 December, will include the traditional literary supplement.
Tips for cultural events will also be provided.
We are also sending you, our subscribers, this digital edition as well, so that you have enough time to order the book as a Christmas present.
Prose texts that follow on from the previous collection Petrček Sellier & Petrček Bellot.
More portions of observing the world and describing ordinary things with an extraordinary poetic attention, depth and atmosphere.
In his second essay, the photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of a small town and Czech society.
The story of a return to roots, which turns out to be only an illusion.
The bohemist and comparatist transfers the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood to the set of a contemporary village.
Her performance is more brutal than the folk version and graduates into horror about emotional emptiness.
In other words, the road back to our instincts is shorter than we are prepared to admit
In his last but one novel, the author tells a less sentimental story about returning from emigration than we are used to.
Those who stayed and those who left, know too little about each other to live together.
Trains are starting to run according to the new timetable, and in some places the operator will change
Trains will begin to run according to the new timetable from Sunday.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where instead of the Czech Railways, RegioJet will begin operating.
Most lines will only have their departure times changed, or their routes will be slightly modified.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the rails.
Drivers started selling tickets during the autumn.
Czech Railways plans to operate an average of 6,783 passenger trains daily in the new timetable, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains.
Trains will cover approximately 118 million kilometres under the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections, trains will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company together with the new timetable will put dozens of new trains into operation.
The main novelty will be the InterJet trains, which will run on the Prague to Cheb lines.
Other new trains will be operated by the carrier in northern Moravia or in the western Czech Republic.
The driver will also raise prices on average by 3.2 percent from next year.
Train fares take inflation into account every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of services on the R23 Ústí nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín line.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways after its success in the ministry of transport's competition.
RegioJet will put on a total of 16 trains a day on the line, eight in each direction.
Further changes will affect long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at stations Havlíčkův Brod, Ždár nad Sázavou and Kolín.
Leo Express preserved its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to maintain as similar journey times as possible for its long-distance trains, even during the planned engineering works.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva and other transport companies should continue.
The driver will be changed in some regional lines as well.
Passengers are expecting changes, for example, in Českolipsko, where, instead of the Czech Railways, the trains of the Trilex company of the German firm Die Länderbahn will be running on the Mladá Boleslav - Česká Lípa - Rumburk line.
Passengers will also be able to use a single ticket for rail travel in the second year.
Their price will increase by 3.2 percent, just as the price of Czech Railways will.
I must disagree.
Are we learning nothing from the other side?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to hide, how they died.
In my life, I have never heard a lecture from the point of view of the slave owner or from that time; no one defends this, only condemns it.
Nobody tells you in schools that black people often sold each other into slavery and that they were often the worst slave masters.
Nobody at school will teach you that colonisers often bought land from the Indians, they will just tell you how brutally we Europeans exterminated them, all the while killing each other off.
I also spent some time in the US, at schools, in northern schools as well as southern ones.
I didn't expect that someone would deliberately cover up facts, but I have heard about it before and to me it is a problem, I am not denying it (in Japan war crimes are quite a taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we have a tendency to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about people's feelings, it's just as it is and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge it without looking at the thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat it.
For example, when we are in the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave owners there are quite popular, on the other hand, they did have some good successes and it seems absurd to me to dismiss that.
In addition, Sever was not much better, as many people today idealize him.
A lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slave owner and that a lot of things also worked against them.
I would never be able to equal that with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, and what is more, they do not give a damn about our opinion (there was a video on YT from television, where someone was cut off, who started to talk about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found strange at US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that our country never experienced.
Overall, I got the impression that at some universities it was a shock, that those students were so radicalised and that those schools were so supportive of it.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, it worries me a little that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is in the young and in the governing elite as well.
It seems to me that feminism has long since achieved what it wanted and has now been radicalised.
At present, those who are labelled as feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts, and then we have further groups such as LGBT, and that leads to radicalisation on both sides, when it leads to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
What is more, the louder someone is, the more radical they are.
In any case, at the end, I have not met anyone who would condemn me for colonialism or slavery.
I met with bad geography, but it was mutual:D
Not because I don't like it, but because it is absolutely pointless.
Am I proud of something I couldn't do myself?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary from the point of view of any personal identity.
If something connects us with people, views of the world and common experiences, not where we were born.
I am not a believer, but I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
Ten Slovak priests are really fine guys, they prefer to preach about theology rather than politics, but then they always throw in some nonsense about coronavirus, that everyone is ashamed of.
Here, of course, is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they sprang from Catholic modernism and are actually Catholics without the Pope.
A lot of people know me who are Catholics, but they go to the services of the Hussites, because it is similar in terms of theology, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically valuable functionalist church on Botanická street.
Apart from the Church of St. Michael at Dominican Square, which belongs to the Dominicans, and where they even hold a Latin mass every Sunday at 15:00, as was done before Vatican II.
Plamínek from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts brought him from Austria
Břeclav - Plamínek, who was defrocked in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts did not go to Vienna due to the coronavirus pandemic, and picked him up at the Reintal – Břeclav border crossing in the morning.
They took it over at the border too.
The Betlémské světlo is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year, and we are really looking forward to it.
It is an honour for me that I have been chosen, the scout Amálie Budíková said to the present journalists.
While the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly at the border bridge, now it took place at the Reintal - Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
But scouts usually travel to Vienna by train for him.
With the spread of the flames across the Czech Republic, nothing has changed.
The scouts traditionally travelled out by train to Brno, where they were met by the bishop of the diocese, Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent transport of the light will be taken care of by scout couriers on Saturday 18 December, who will travel by selected fast trains and personal trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over from them at the stations and spread the light further across the Czech Republic, and even where trains don't go.
Scouts had to comply with the valid measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It's happening in a similar way to London.
We are recommending the courier teams, and the organisers of local events, to of course wear masks, to keep their distance, and to not sing, just to behave in a way that makes it as safe as possible, said the spokesperson for the Bethlehem Lights campaign Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels around Europe, originated in Austria in 1986.
The aim is to spread the idea of space, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope, a light that conquers darkness for believers.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and guides have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The action involves hundreds of volunteers and the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human solidarity.
All the news, including the list of places where people can come for the wreath, can be found on the web pages www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education so I don't know the basics of economy which would confirm that the subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think that the subsidies as such would be the problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (such as water retention), healthcare and education make appropriate use of these funds, so I do not understand why these funds are given to agriculture, industry and generally to companies.
As mentioned above, it produces unnecessary products and crowds out the free market and “the natural life of the company”.
I work in a factory where there are millions of posters on the walls saying "XY funded/co-funded by the XY project" and that kind of company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of the company that gives work to x people, this is the rushing of development when this company holds on and takes away orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Almost complete agreement, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age will fall into some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that internet adverts don't bother me, but then suddenly I ask myself if they haven't influenced me at all – it's just so ingrained that one can't help but succumb to it.
For this reason, I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to impose an absolute ban on programmatic advertising...
It's all nonsense, in the words of the classic - I would ban the internet.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots in (but predominantly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe in something just because most people do and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe in something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important to have my own original opinion about which I will argue is critical thinking."
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television is promoting the trend of Christmas films, two hundred of which are having their premiere this year
Los Angeles - China, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen into the trend of Christmas films and this year will premiere a record more than two hundred of them for their viewers.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been popular with the public in recent years and significantly increases viewership, so there are more and more of these films being made.
This year, four times as many Christmas films were made as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database includes only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so the actual number of Christmas films is much higher.
The films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated with fairy tales, and globally, films such as Home Alone, Heavenly Love or the classic Christmas story Beauty of Life from 1946 are popular.
However, the real boom in Christmas photos only started in 2009, when the American cable television network Hallmark started a special film series, recalled the BBC server.
Her Advent project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station began to tease its viewers on Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Competitor Lifetime will be screening 35 new Christmas-themed films this year and the popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the overall total.
"In this magical period of the story, it doesn't matter so much that it's not true, it's just important that there's lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of the book, I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, described the genre with irony.
It is an escape, a way to feel some calm in the middle of all the holiday madness and madness of the world in which we live, Gray added.
According to him, for example, the Hallmark channel uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's some misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which is resolved successfully and they kiss.
That's just the way it is, and as long as all the films look the same and have the same atmosphere, people will carry on watching them, says Gray.
Mazepin had a positive text about Covid-19 and will not take part in the final race of F1.
Only nineteen drivers will take part in the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive test for Covid-19 and will not compete in the last race of the season.
The Haas team will send only one car to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was to attack for a better position from 20th place, which he qualified for.
Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was positively tested for Covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will line up on the starting grid: from the back of the grid, Mazepin's team mate Mick Schumacher will set off, and from the front, Max Verstappen, who will be directly competing with Lewis Hamilton for the title.
According to the statement of the Haas team, Mazepin is relatively all right and does not exhibit any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will be governed by the instructions of the relevant public health bodies, with safety being the top priority for all involved parties," said her representatives for formula1.com.
Haas is not allowed to send a reserve driver to the race.
Any substitute would have to undergo qualification or ride in another part of the weekend.
The Covid-19 does not affect the first athlete.
At the start of the season just ending, Covid-19 had Kimi Räikkönen, while Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton were positively tested.
They can also be closed for this.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price of the most expensive sword will amaze you!
It is a bit like portable jewellery and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but I had little experience – back home, we’ve always used candles, says Liban, who spent 3000 hours on his work over the course of a half a year.
He bought the silk in Italy, 24-carat gold thread in France and 2,000 decorative crystals from the Swarowski company.
The silver stars were then adorned with 150 diamonds.
The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds shine, says the creator of the work, which should not be washed.

The government approved the sending of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Soldiers, explorers and drone pilots could set off before Christmas, the mission has been approved for six months.
They will help their Polish colleagues protect the border with Belarus and build the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO countries in connection with a number of months of actions by the Belarusian regime, which has invited citizens from Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of an easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Mutace Omikron is spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiena is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
Currently we have another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from ZŠ Adamov has not been proven," said Ciupek.
Six cases were reported in the region in the past week.
We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - this is being done by the National Reference Laboratory for flu and non-flu viruses at the State Health Institute in Prague, the director said.
She added that it was two nurses from one workplace at the Brno Teaching Hospital and two of their children, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils from the Adamov primary school.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, four are without symptoms.
Nobody with suspicion of Omikron traveled abroad
None of them travelled abroad, nor did anyone from their families, nor was there any contact with anyone who was staying abroad.
None of the people mentioned have anything to do with the water polo championship, Ciupek said.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová earlier said that the international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, is being investigated.
There were players from South Africa on it and one Belgian player fell ill on his return.
California restricts the sale of weapons.
It wants to follow the example of Texas in banning abortions.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a plan on Saturday to ban the sale and production of some guns in the nation's most populous state using a legal mechanism Texas has employed in its controversial abortion law that prohibits the procedure after a fetal heartbeat is detected.
People had a right to claim damages from anyone who makes or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was a response to the ruling of the US Supreme Court on Friday, which upheld a Texas ban on abortions, despite it contradicting a near 50-year-old precedent that established a woman's right to an abortion across the US until roughly the 24th week of pregnancy.
However, it did not rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative construction of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban was thus transferred to the public, which made it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it in court.
I am outraged by yesterday's (Wednesday's) ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States, which upheld Texas' ban on the majority of abortion services and, to a large extent, supported Texas's maneuver to protect its law, said the California governor.
“If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human life,” Newsom continues.
He reportedly ordered his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the minister of justice on measures that would authorize representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault weapons and so-called spirit weapons in cooperation with the state parliament and the minister of justice.
This is how homemade weapons, not marked with serial numbers and intended for circumventing regulations, are designated.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have a right to demand at least $10,000 (CZK 220,000) in damages and court fees from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault weapons, parts for "ghost guns" or kits to make them in California.
If the most effective way to keep these horrible weapons off our streets is through the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do, said the California governor.
The AP news agency reports that California had for decades banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons, but in June a federal judge here blocked that ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban now, using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion warned against expanding that legal mechanism to other states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas' ban on abortions complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to proceed with lawsuits against the state.
Every emergency vaccination has a public testing phase, during which it is gradually decided what the vaccination scheme will look like and the vaccines themselves are also improved, based on the results.
For example, there are already large studies on the effects of the fourth dose from Israel.
According to these studies, in the majority of patients, antibodies increase fivefold, which has the aforementioned long-term effect.
It's just like any other vaccination - it will have its vaccination scheme in time, just not yet.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, is to come onto the market soon, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission is acting in violation of the law if it uses the new powers and suspends payments to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for drawing 36 billion euros from the EU budget for the reconstruction of economies affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
He is under pressure from the European Parliament to push ahead and use the mechanism enabling the withdrawal of EU funding from countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto in all matters requiring unanimity, said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lack a majority in the Sejm.
Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which leads to a drastic increase in energy prices, added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, we will call for Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
It is unacceptable in the light of the fact that the EU is unlawfully depriving us of funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, added the Polish minister.
His party's stance on access to the EU is more radical than that of the ruling party, Právo a spravedlnost.
According to the European Commission, changes made to the Polish judiciary during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subject it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is putting "impossible conditions, because its goal is not a legal state, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing a "political dictatorship imposed by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He pointed out that Poland should be a member of an EU founded on partnership between sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest, and the Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never agree to such concessions to Brussels, which would limit Poland's sovereignty.
We will never agree to Poland being a colony, he said.
And to confess to that... In Lidl we have one type of cheese in four different places.
I looked for the other things, I bumped into yogurt more than once, I needed only cheese and ham, after ten minutes I gave up at the milk counter and asked.
They did have it, it's true, in that narrow sector there were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the no-lactose zone...
If I'm evicted, I won't even go to any markets, I won't do anything, I won't go to the gold shop in the square, they don't have such a selection, but they usually have everything I need, in some order, so in ten minutes I'm done.
I want to go on vacation.
It's all the same to me now.
I've been following this for two years now, and it seems to me that the anti-vaccination lobbyists are just a little bit more on the fringe than the pro-vaccination lobbyists.
Rational debate at a professional level is taking place, but extreme opinions are the only ones to make it into the public sphere.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Everything prohibited, everything permitted.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples with pears.
This state has it and we have it too.
But nobody deals with the fact that the methodology of data collection is different in those two countries.
That's how I cheered up.
Sorry for the leak and enjoy a nice day everyone.
As a child, I was punished with a spanking.
It was never due to badges, usually it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was annoyed (read books instead, washed my hair, etc.).
At the same time, I have never been punished without a warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get hurt (sometimes even after another "screaming" she just brought the saucepan and put it in front of me, so I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few slaps in the back (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in reasonable implementation and dose) is beneficial, because the child reacts much more to it than to words.
It is important to me that part with the warning, because it gives the child a choice of whether not to listen and get it, or to improve and not get the punishment.
In the end, I mostly just needed a warning to start listening.
Defending the system
When prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl responded to a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution means to him – whether the sacred document on which one swears an oath and which one learns about in school from an early age, or on the other hand a treaty that can be amended if necessary – he unequivocally opted for the former.
Once we agreed on the democratic rules of our life within the institute, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and which changes we can better dispense with.
Imagine: some countries actually like their rules.
Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, glossed over the question Vojtěch Cepl at the time.
In recent days, however, an increasing number of lawyers have taken the view that the Czech Constitution needs to be changed.
The game was tested in situations its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) couldn't predict, such as the behaviour of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
All we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be carefully considered.
The institute needs to be understood and actively defended, for only then can it be the key to mastering most of the crises that have beset companies throughout history.
The constitution is also a kind of rulebook for governing, made up of individual rules that set limits on politicians' games.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we are tying politicians' hands with bans.
At the same time, however, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to abuse their power.
Covid does not discriminate, in FN Brno they are fighting for the life of a premature baby for several months
Although it is known that coronavirus is milder for children, there are also serious cases, which are mainly dealt with by hospitals recently.
We know that children are less threatened and affected than adults - by 2 to 5 percent in comparison with adults, said Petr Dominik, the head of the Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation Clinic of the Brno Teaching Hospital and the Medical Faculty of Masaryk University to Novinky.
The course is much simpler, lighter, and often occurs without symptoms.
They are children who are seriously ill with coronavirus, which we are seeing especially in the last period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, dozens of children need mild supportive care.
It is set in a children's infectious diseases clinic.
Seriously ill children with coronavirus have recently been treated at the ARU.
Children with post-covid syndromes were on the ward continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
“Now we are seeing an increase in the number of children with acute COVID-19 pneumonia, which means they have inflamed lungs requiring admission to an intensive care unit,” he said, adding that the illness is affecting not only adults but also adolescents and even premature infants.
Children in a serious condition due to coronavirus are also being treated in hospitals.
At the moment we have a few babies and adolescents in hospital, said the head doctor.
I am glad, however, that in the children's hospital FN Brno they have not recorded any child deaths due to coronavirus.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominik, in the children's hospital – not just in the coronavirus ward – a psychologist's role is indispensable.
It also points out that, just like in adults, vaccination mitigates the course of the disease and reduces the occurrence of post-covid syndrome in children.
We also recommend the vaccine for children, the doctor added.
In the quiet zone you can only walk on marked paths.
But the calm zone is not that big.
You can see them on the tourist map at mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere in national parks, except for the quiet zone (but don't jump over the fence into the paddock).
It is not allowed to go skiing/mountain biking in the forest off the marked trails anywhere unless you have an exemption (but of course this does not apply in national parks).
How does a conductor train?

He was released by the Liberec opera and originally played the forest horn.
As a singer, he can perform nearly the entire repertoire, and as a conductor he not only works in the Liberec F. Šalda Theatre, but also in Plzeň, in the Theatre of J. K. Tyla.
It cooperates with the Hradec Králové Philharmonic Orchestra, the Film Orchestra, or the Podkrkonoš Symphony Orchestra.
China is giving the impression of having the epidemic under control and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is giving the impression of having the epidemic under control and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China launched a healthcare and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticized for not being able to stop the outbreak, which turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in the number of cases.
States including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective gear, and Chinese doctors are helping to fight the coronavirus, even in the worst-affected Italy.
How to interpret Beijing's willingness?
Is it a friendly gesture or is the Communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
Run into a friend and say to him: don't you want a giraffe?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because it mows the lawn, washes the car and the children play with it.
Just a parade.
If you want to buy a giraffe for 5000,- let me know.
Friend: I guess that will be a parade...
After some time, they meet again and the one who bought it complains: those voles, you sold them for a donkey?
The lawn is trampled, huge crowds everywhere, the car is overturned, the children are fighting and the wife wants to get a divorce.
Ten co-produced says: you're not selling the giraffe, you're not selling the giraffe...
World events are controlled by the great powers.
Despite the equality of sovereign states, it is precisely the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a great power if it works on its integration.
So far, it is functioning at the level of economy and politics (in selected areas), but military integration is still missing.
In my opinion, Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be for 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century moods will be different and it will work out.
It occurred to me and it is possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so I may have made some mistakes.
Based on that, I assume that an ellipse usually includes two different units at the same level.
I am borrowing an example from another comment, “Spanish oranges and mandarins”, where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas with “Spanish fruit and mandarins” it is not clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
In addition, I base myself on the sentence sounding like “all American forces”, including their weapons, and I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already covered by this broad term and it should not be necessary to specify this for the US forces.
And again, just for fun:D
Whether it is so or not, it is an unreasonable demand

Vicki Holland tortured monkey Milly from Britain
Disturbing footage shows the moment the terrified monkey crouched in the toilet bowl before its heartless owner laughed at it and flushed it away.
The orangutan was also fed hamburgers, kebabs and French fries, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
Gwent magistrates' court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, the Sun newspaper reports.
Experts in gorilla rehabilitation, who care for Milly after she was abused, said they had never seen an animal so traumatised.
Milly spent almost two years being rehabilitated by the staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The quadruple mother admitted two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Gwent Magistrates' Court she was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison, suspended for one year.
Hollandová was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifelong ban on keeping animals and must pay court costs of approximately 12,000 crowns.
Team leader Steph Sawyer, who has been rehabilitating the abused animal, said: "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will still continue."
Milly waited until she got used to people again.
She cringed and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
Opička refused to eat for a long time.
Now, when she has settled and is happy with the male, the sight of new people can still trigger panic.
The psychological scars from the abuse will follow her forever, adds Sawyer.
The abuse of Milly only came to light after police in Gwent discovered sickening footage on her phone after raiding her home over drug allegations.
The footage features Milly using vulgar language.
In the next video, you can hear Holland offering the monkey cocaine and saying: 'Want some cocaine?'
Don't touch my fingers.
In May, together with her partner Russell Cox (43), she admitted to holding cocaine with the intention of selling it.
Cocaine worth £1,600 was found hidden in Kinder Eggs in her home.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
What amazing concepts will you learn three times in a row when you courageously jump over the whole of the 20th century?
Do you take the same things to the first grade as you did in the sixth grade?
The whole thing kills the idea of biffling, when nobody cares whether you can do it or whether you understand it.
Mostly write a test for 1 and then no one is interested.
Run and ask people at random in the street whether they can determine the character of the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everyone has been through it, and the absolute majority haven't deleted it and will tell you that it is absolutely true.
What does that bitch teach?
I'm a big fan of general overviews and the fact is that people don't want and don't need it.
At that moment it is useless and you will never get it.
It is being learned for the many people who will need that thing.
Well, as a matter of fact, you don't need to know all that at the stand by the machine, I was serious... ...because you don't need it.
In addition, we are gradually getting to the era when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Which we can probably blame on our Communist past as well) However, the price of having brutes standing guard over those machines is simply too high.
If only journalists knew how to count, then here, Covid probably never reached these dimensions.
Wedding at first sight: Kadri and Andrey's war continues!
This is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave immediately," Andrea answered to curious fans on Instagram stories who asked why Kadir had disappointed her so much that she had decided to terminate all contact and even block him on social media.
Kadrim and Andreou have been at loggerheads since the start of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and he imagined that Andrea would move there, so at least until she returned to the Czech Republic for good.
She resolutely rejected it.
As it turns out, their relationship did not end with love, but rather evolved into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was all planned by you! Kadri was outraged by Andreis accusations of lying, gambling and debts.
Kadri's alleged honesty was not appreciated by his ex-wife or his younger sister Linda.
He decided to publicly defend his brother.
We normally do not talk about such things at all and we have never talked about them in the family.
I don't want to provoke any pity.
But when I see someone who is trying to defame and spit on the name of someone I like so much, I just can't take it!
I'm sorry I have to do it this way, but I want to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for being such a great character and helping our family when we needed it most, even though he was so young.
The more I read such false information, the more it disgusts me, because it is probably so far removed from the truth.
I would like everyone to know Kadri as I, our close friends and family, stand by our declaration in response to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful for everything!
People will believe what is written, of course, but the most important thing is that we, his family, loved him and knew him and know the truth and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunken thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
Don't believe it for that reason.
Cchao started his robbery spree in the parking lot in the residential district, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the available information, he eventually stole around 330 crowns from one of the vehicles.
Then nothing better happened than to climb up to the fifth floor and to sneak in through an open window into the apartment.
He stole two bananas.
He is then caught on CCTV walking out of the shop and eating a banana.
When the apartment's owner woke up in the morning, he noticed that the bananas were not where they were supposed to be and called the police.
Then Cchaa detained her.
The man admitted that on the day in question he had consumed some alcohol.
Since he needed money, he decided to steal.
The matter is currently under investigation.
The thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to the level of pandemic preparedness.
If this is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law limits the scope of business
Isn't that reason enough?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters turned out for the Saturday elections of four municipal councils
New representatives were chosen by the people on Saturday in the municipalities of Komňa u Uherského Hradiště, Lužice u Mostu, Nová Ves u Liberecka and Rovná u Pelhřimova.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the number stipulated by law or the elected representative assemblies broke up.
A total of 28 mandates were contested by 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33.
Processing the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a rather demanding, but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections to local councils took place in it, and above all, the elections to the Chamber of Deputies were very closely watched, stated the vice-chairwoman of the CSÚ, Eva Krumpová.
She reminded that the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personal security due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
In the Komni on Uherskohradišťsku, the Saturday elections were won by the Association of Independent Candidates, which received 27.76 percent of the votes and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means gaining two mandates.
Two seats in the council were won by Občané pro Komňu, who received 18.52 percent of the votes.
Again, the post of mayor went to Jana Křižková, the current mayor and a member of the Soukromníci party.
Independent candidates reached one mandate in the council.
75.48 percent of the eligible voters cast their votes.
In the village of Rovná, Pelhřimov District, the Pro Rovná association won.
It received 50.5 percent of the votes, which translates into four out of seven mandates.
Another two representatives of the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one of the Association of Independent Candidates 2 also made it to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lužice na Mostecku were won again by the Association of Lužice and Svinčice, led by mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 percent of the votes and, like in 2018, has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The second place went to the Obec pro lid (Village for the People) candidate, which received 43.27 percent of the votes and will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the polls.
Elections in Nová Ves won by independent candidates Naděje pro Novou Ves ahead of the ANO movement.
For the Association of Independent Candidates, 59.88 percent of voters voted and gained four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and for the 2018 regular elections it gained more mandates and now has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday the results of the elections will be debated by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think that you are well aware of all these things, people are writing to you here.
You are playing the fool to have someone to talk to.
If not, it's sad.
I object that Christians are degenerates, or anything of the sort.
I actually like quite a few church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the point, so that they looked good).
It's all the same to me who believes in what.
On the other hand, I dislike how much power the Church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it amassed, the stifling of science, etc.
Let's forget all the wars it caused, like the Thirty Years' War
Tl;dr: Believe in the spaghetti monster if you want, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell headfirst from a height of twelve metres.
He survived the impact with the concrete.
An incredible fall was survived by a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, who was rescued by the emergency medical service.
Staff at the regional operational centre took over an hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two crews of the ZZS - a medical one and an ambulance - arrived at the scene immediately.
On arrival at the scene, medics discovered that a 27-year-old man had fallen from a window of about 12 metres and landed on his head on the concrete below!
Coal was mined in Vítkovice.
Not as it should be and the firefighters went to the scene.
When the rescue teams arrived, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of his life.
The emergency resuscitation physician intubated his respiratory tract, ensured artificial lung ventilation and after further emergency care measures transported him in the ambulance to further care of the Ostrava Trauma Centre, informed the spokesperson for the Moravian-Silesian Region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried about inadequate responses from the public and authorities than the coronavirus
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic represents a challenge for politicians and officials, but in the front line of the fight against the infection are primarily doctors and healthcare staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We are talking to military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a parade of interesting results.
Things are really heating up at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to defeat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who for seven years had not been defeated.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight category. He showed a great neck crank against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France also won, defeating Cody Garbrandt by technical knockout in the first round.
He also defeated his opponent Sean O'Malley.
Surprise no one expected.
It also brought the women's bantamweight bout between famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the mutual battle as a virtual "dwarf", because Nunes has not lost for seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
The start of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the match very aggressively and even delivered a push kick to her opponent, which sent her to the ground.
Penova, however, was not to be intimidated into any further mistakes and herself attempted in vain to attack with a backhand.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both competitors delivered a number of outstanding strokes and hard serves.
Furthermore, Peňová threw Nunes to the ground and began to choke her.
He had to give up the attack.
The American delivered a huge shock when she won the title.
The main event of the evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At the beginning it went better for Poirier, but the card was gradually turned over.
In the second, Oliveira tried to be more active. He attempted to pin his opponent's arm to the mat.
It didn't work out too well for me, but I put myself under a lot of pressure, got my opponent on his back and piled in with a load of shots.
Thanks to that he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but eventually had to tap out.
The Brazilian successfully defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley achieved a suverénní triumph. In the first round, he put Raulian Paiva in a hard right rear lock.
He then beat him with a series of precisely aimed blows and won his 15th triumph.
Kara-France managed to beat Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, and now, after seven years, she lost.
Ten kyčel, or that kyčel?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, and there is therefore no problem in determining whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
There is also a fairly large group of nouns in which the gender is not settled.
Such important names fluctuate between two genders.
When declining, they take on double endings and in some cases remain in the uninflected form.
For example, the words "svízel" and "kyčel" are masculine and feminine, respectively, and are declined according to the pattern "stroj" in the first case and "píseň" in the second.
Other groups of nouns have different forms in the singular already in the first declension, e.g. "row/rows", "coat/coat" or "potato/potatoes" (in the sense of food).
Both terms are written, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some words may vary regionally, for example "cucumber" in the Czech Republic and "gherkin" in Moravia, in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, similarly other Czech-Moravian pairs of words are: "moat" and "moat", "bun" and "bun", etc.
Some words, which entered the Czech language from other languages, were originally uninflected, but gradually adopt Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is masculine as well as feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained in the middle gender and has masculine endings according to the pattern "castle".
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
How does the situation look directly on the Greek borders?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants who are trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to move towards the southern edge of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped protecting them.
European politicians have promised Greece support, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What really motivates refugees to take an uncertain path?
What is the situation on the ground?
We haven't seen the blue sky for three months and we are suffocating, a journalist from Sydney said
Fires that have ravaged Australia for nearly a month have killed almost three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and scorched millions of hectares of land.
How are local authorities and residents coping with the disaster?
Could the government of Prime Minister Morrison do more to prevent the drastic impacts, as critics claim?
What will the country have to prepare for in terms of climate change in the future?
Lenka Kabrhelová is talking to Ika Detrichova, a journalist from Sydney.
False accusations have always been and are very rare.
Proto writes about everything everywhere.
It is unpleasant to solve how widespread sexual violence is in our society and how it looks like.
I don't know anyone who was falsely accused.
I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have seen how their environment or even the police often behave towards these people.
The victims should always be believed.
Finally, the victims are opening up about their traumas.
But not that many people are ready to admit it.
And there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It is hurtful and offensive to all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a big part of the accusations are false" and that it is "a trend" you are only helping sexual abusers.
The Czech Republic is flooded by unfinished houses, families do not have money to complete them
Prices of building materials have risen by more than 30 percent in the last weeks and months.
A number of people got into a tricky situation because of this.
It does not have the resources to complete the family homes that are under construction, and banks are refusing to increase its mortgages.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is also increasing.
People do not have enough money to complete already started family homes.
In many cases banks are refusing to raise their mortgages, which is creating extremely unpleasant situations for them.
In the best case, people move into half-built and uninspected houses.
In the worst case, the completed houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgage and rent, says economist BHS Štěpán Křeček
We are going to build two to three family houses next year and it will work for fifty percent of them.
It is hard for us as a construction company that we have to abide by some things in the contract even though the materials got more expensive.
So we're doing it for free," said the owner of construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
Most people will have financial problems.
If they counted on the house costing five million, now it will cost seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivoň.
The material was most affected by lead, iron and also installation and heating equipment.
Construction companies are also struggling with a lack of skilled workers.
In the Czech Republic, there is a lack of graduates in building professions and the influx of foreign workers is hampering the spread of the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuing of building permits is more favourable.
In October, building authorities issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10 percent more than in the same period last year, Křeček added.
We are doing well and will do even better.
But there is a lack of real visions, says the commentator of the Czech Radio – myRozhlas
In addition to the traditional celebrations, entry into the new year is also traditionally accompanied by speeches from politicians.
This year, besides the Prime Minister and the leader of ANO, Andrej Babiš, and the Christmas message of the President Miloš Zeman, we also heard speeches from the chairmen of the Senate and the House of Commons.
What did we learn that is fundamental?
Just like my diploma thesis is super, I have chosen my own topic, I always work on it throughout the year and then finish the written part in a week or two.
State officials are completely calm here, unless someone is a total idiot and something got stuck in their head, in which case the commission will not waste their time on theory.
I had a week to learn the state coat of arms and when I was at the end of my tether, the committee always tried to lead me to some logical deduction, which I got right away and I had it correct.
Apart from these projects, people know that some pay someone to do their semester project for them (we have done this a lot, it is really beneficial, you learn a lot), and then they just learn the project and have it done.
According to me, it is super when the end of the subject is an exam, which tests the knowledge gained in the course of the project, not just the defence.
However, do not send e-mails and do not call and do not send any parcels to the embassy.
You will be the same as them.
That has nothing to do with the embassy.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them because otherwise something could happen to them.
You can put up a statue of Putin next to the bear statue.
He should at least give him a slap in the face, or something like that.
I agree, even though Instagram is throwing spanners in the works for artists.
If you don't post stories and at least one new picture every second day, your achievements will be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, it changes what is more important for the function, whether the like, comment or storage.
Lately I've been so busy, so I may have to slow down to a tick-tock, where a lot of artists from my genre have success and I just can't allow that.
In the end, I would be happy if something more user-friendly were to come along, which would not drain all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Declaration of the Party of Workers on the Donbass
Yes, break-up – no, that's what opponents of the break-up of the USSR say in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 7, 1991, the biggest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind occurred.
In the Belovezhskaya Pushcha on December 8th, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum on March 17th, 1991, with an openly conciliatory attitude towards Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly and without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With one stroke of the pen they wiped out a huge country with almost three million inhabitants.
The collapse of the USSR led to millions of ethnic Russian citizens being left abroad.
Since the beginning of the nineties, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Regardless of the loss of non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars together!
Earlier the same people, who in one sitting in the Bialowieza Forest destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously undertook deindustrialization, halted agricultural development, and separated from the fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the break-up of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all of this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the abandonment first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a "vacuum of power".
Everything that was rushed through and given up on quickly filled and conquered the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
The whole world has been shaken ever since the events of the end of the eighties and the beginning of the nineties of the last century.
The price of the product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover need not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 Kč / kg.
I'll get it with the intention of putting it in the freezer and making it for dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I don't buy this meat on Monday, the chain reduces it to 99 Kč / kg on Tuesday - explain to me the mechanism by which this meat, by changing its price, becomes a burden on my digestive system?
A or should I wait until Thursday and the meat will be reduced to 69 Kč / kg a day before the date of consumption - what would this meat differ from that which I bought on Monday for 120 Kč and left it in my freezer for 3 days?
I reply to myself - nothing.
These people think that if something is cheap, it must be bad, substandard or low quality, which is just ridiculous;-)
Recently I went to Brno to Hlavas and in the underpass some lady was handing out some brochure and I always take such things to help the brigaders to throw it away...
No, the brochure was full of rural common sense and conservative views of how the world works, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I sensed that it would be some kind of agitprop.
After reading it, I found out who issued it and in the end, Scientology emerged.
No, it was a good match, full of completely useless tips, as if I had to wash myself and not to be peckish.
It would be a shame to waste paper because of this.
Something similar happened to me with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you give in to that person because you like them, without realising quite how much power the situation has over you.
She threatened me several times because I went out with a guy she didn't like.
And when I wanted to leave her apartment, she broke down and begged me not to go anywhere.
Potom began to physically block the doors.
It was a super relationship for about a year, but then another six months went by and it all fell apart.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that I was leaving and that I would talk to her about it next week so she wouldn't go off the rails or something.
Such a person sucks the energy, emotions and overall joy from you.
Rather keep the distance
When insurance companies are tearing their hair out buying up batches of tests and going hunting for positive cases, who would ever suspect that this terrible disease even existed?
The only thing we can achieve is complications for companies, drivers and others, because their employees were sentenced to five days of home arrest in the generator of random numbers.
In the West, they have already given up on that and recognise that it is not worth solving weaker illnesses than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and has to put on some weight and polish his ego with some buzzing.
I am glad that the old good coach returns to us.
After several years of decline and the suppression of this disreputable business, MLM recruitment is returning to the limelight.
I was one of the recruits; I thought I'd give it a try (I was 20, a first-year at university), initial vows about training products and commercial skills quickly morphed into "it's not really your thing, especially when it comes to getting people on board".
I was interested in the products I was selling because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and shock people.
When the first profits came in, people realised quickly that if they wanted to earn, they had to launch a few certain products monthly.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only sources of income, so people felt like door-to-door salesmen.
What can I say, the experience was priceless. People learned that you shouldn't believe everything you hear and that you have to check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I would not put all my eggs in one basket.
People in this business are successful and helpful, but they certainly will not brag about expensive consumer goods or "fat" bank accounts.
I haven't experienced anything like that in the corporation where I work.
HR is quiet, managers are looking at their management and no one is bothering us.
Regular assessment takes place in some way, in the form that it happens with us (set some goals for the next year, see what happened and what did not) - it is rather self-assessment than someone assessing you based on some numbers, and so on.
Fire drills are also voluntary.
And we are a bit unique within our company - there are departments which are more "corporate".
Sometimes you have the feeling that you're some kind of start-up that's squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
It won't affect us much until the results come in.
The Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
British police had been searching for the 32-year-old Czech woman, who disappeared at the end of November, for almost ten days without success.
On Sunday 12 December the Minister of Foreign Affairs in demission Jakub Kulhánek announced on the social networks that they had found the woman from Uherský Brod dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they had found the body of the missing Czech woman.
The cause of death is being investigated.
We will not provide more information about the family.
Sincere condolences, Kulhánek posted on Twitter.
The last time they saw the young woman was on 28 November in a bus on the way from work, when she had gone to withdraw money from a cash machine.
Colleagues reported her missing five days later.
Afterwards, the London police started looking for her, and Interpol included her on the list of missing people all over the world.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police have already arrested one man in connection with the incident a few days ago.
What role he played and what he suspected, but did not publish.
In four municipalities, new councils were elected at the end of the year
On Saturday 11 December, in the municipalities of Komňa u Uherského Hradiště, Lužice u Mostu, Nová Ves u Liberce and Rovná u Pelhřimova, new councils were elected.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the number stipulated by law or the elected representative assemblies broke up.
28 mandates were contested by 99 valid candidates in the new elections.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33.
A total of 13 candidate lists have been registered for the new election of representatives in the four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men running for the 28 council seats.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 and the oldest 72.
Processing the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a rather demanding, but successful year.
Four new or repeated elections to local councils took place in it, and above all, the elections to the Chamber of Deputies were very closely watched.
At the same time, we mostly worked in more demanding epidemiological conditions, which imposed greater demands on equipment and personal security, said Eva Krumpová, 1st deputy chairman of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the voting will be debated by the State Electoral Commission and, following approval, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
That is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
I coped with the fact that we had a really dangerous infectious disease at the beginning, but it was just for a short time and without any major complications.
I struggle with how to deal with the fact that a great part of the population is behaving like idiots on all levels.
I'm most looking forward to getting vaccinated (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on the fact that other people aren't jerks.
He was deprived of the function of the President and the ability to regain it.
However, the chance of that really happening is as good as none.
In addition, I am not sure whether the recording of the survey could be considered treason at all.
An act of treason is one where the President of the Republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected our private lives: The number of people under 35 without sex for a year is on the rise
Ever more young adults in the USA are living their lives without sex.
They are mainly religious people, the Daily Mail website reports.
The survey showed that the share of people under 35 who abstain from sexual activity has grown from eight to 21 percent between 2008 and 2021.
Women aged between 18 and 35 who said they had not had sex in the last year is more than ever before.
The decline in the number of sexually active individuals is also contributed by other factors, a survey conducted by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them could be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, could also have contributed.
"Since 2010, the share of men and women aged 18 to 35 who say they had no sex in the previous year has risen quickly," researcher Lyman Stone of IFS said.
Among people in a marriage, sexual activity is more frequent and only 5% of them stated that they did not have sex for the entire year of 2021.
Among the general population, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage before the age of 35 is a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also contributed by fear of premarital sex and religious beliefs.
Despite the fact that married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and unmarried younger than 35 years old is still decreasing.
Young people's views on premarital sex divide, about 30% think it is a bad thing, while around 70% think it is okay.
It's true that in this age group, single people are in the minority, but their behaviour is moving the trend, says Stone.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious foundations.
Since 2008, among single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the proportion of abstinence has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
Among "less believers," the trend rose from 10 to 20 percent," Stone declared.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and, above all, the social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is smaller in people without work, or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the spread of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, which is "replacing" this need.
This trend was most noticeable during the lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The question of mandatory vaccination against Covid is whether the company should be allowed to force a part of the population to do something they don't want to do, but which might save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, on which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether, if we don't arrange it and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be held responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know, we didn't explain it to him very well, he heard some misinformation, couldn't be vaccinated, and then caught it and died.
On the other hand, I cannot imagine that we can mourn the death of a diehard opponent of vaccination, who at the side of the SPD and the KSČ spouts something about harassment and totalitarian state.
It can be clearly inferred from these statistics that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners belong to the second group, so they really will be able to get it for themselves.
The Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
So far this winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent years.
Ski resort operators cannot do without technical snow, and the weather is complicating the preparations for the cross-country skiing Jizerská 50 race.
Is it a trend, or an exception?
Will little snow mean a battle against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one joke, but it's not about a waiter.
Once our teacher led us across the whole city to the shipyard so we could sail boats on the river.
That's where we went for a walk once, down a really wide street, and we didn't see anyone - members of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they dumped on us.
Fortunately, I managed to escape, but I started talking to one of my friends.
When she left, we asked her and the teacher what she had said.
He asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I've already told them I have no soul," she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, was laughing all the way to the shipyard.
We are terribly embarrassed.
It's not that bad, but the system is already crumbling, says Orozovič
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after his previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday and was welcomed by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honours.
We are opening a new chapter in our mutual relations, said Morawiecki at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must make it clear that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis caused by disturbing movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian borders can be solved by using diplomatic negotiations, and this applies to the “Normandy format” as well, bringing together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that the chancellor was informed about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has artificially created a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because every night we record hundreds of attempts to (illegal) cross the borders.
The Chancellor was dealing with further sanctions to make it clear to Lukašenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz, according to the DPA agency, assured that Warsaw is enjoying German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the regime of Lukašenko for its inhumane treatment of refugees.
Drunken Polish nun caused accident and tried to cover it up
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but it was being driven by another nun who was trying to blame herself.
When the police told her that she could lose her driver's license and have to leave the scene of the accident even if she was not at fault, she admitted the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun ran into the car and asked for help.
Police then came for her sister Celestina.
She underwent a breath test and was immediately deprived of her driver's license when it was established that her blood alcohol level exceeded 0.02.
At the same time, they informed her that she would be tried in court for her actions.
Pes Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič, however, did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies were inspired by American stories about dog lovers.
But they forgot one thing in the process: the laws of filmmaking.
After the heart-warming film F. Brabce Gump - a dog that taught people to live, another film is now being made that deals with audience emotions in cinemas.
The co-author of the screenplay and the director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič ml., loosely continues his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
The talking donkey Hugo returns to the scene and some well-known characters appear around him.
Julie and Ivan, owners of the dilapidated mountain pension, summon peasants, Julie's father with his partner and, above all, her daughter Veronika.
She's no longer a little girl, but a young woman experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner, Beatriz Shajmovičová, who is also the producer of the film, struggled with the storytelling in the previous dog movie, but at least the children and the dog were entertained.
This time the creative duo wrote an even weaker screenplay, which provokes a mixture of admiration and embarrassment.
Let's sum it up.
Even though she is a scientist, Julie succumbs to the urge to have a child, and if the "constellation" is right, she has sex with her forestry engineer, Ivan, anywhere the coordinates just happen to be – on the car roof or the church tower (during the ongoing excursion with the local guide, of course), despite long training, retired colonel Mojmír shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, and is then taken to hospital by the family, so that the miraculous process of recovery can take place in the heart of the Šumava wilderness.
Nic against natural healing and the strength of animal milk.
Their owners know why they have them.
The spectators, however, were surprised by the content of the performance full of unbelievable situations and figures.
A pair of jewel thieves from the staff, a pea-shooting competition, a Shumava charlatan, policemen arriving to investigate "drugs" and arguing about the fertilising power of nettle ash – and of course, the baked family in the boarding house, who will naturally all get drunk.
When the heroine awakes after a heavy coma and then sits, made-up and with a cigarette in hand, at the family table demanding her father's whiskey and ginger ale as a cured vegetarian, one cannot help but laugh.
The creators also explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build up pivotal situations, a feeling for characters and the point, and directorial guidance.
The performances are uneven, the cutting is without direction and the overall impression is unconvincing.
While Lukáš Vaculík, JitkaJežková or Nela Boudová are trying to keep their parties together, they don't have much to play with.
The only redeeming feature of the film are the poetic shots of the Šumava countryside by cameraman Vladimír Holomka and the two Jezevčík brothers.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog's barks, let alone vulgar expressions used by the characters.
Neither is her long-standing membership of the Goose Breeders' Club - as was the case with the producer.
Those with good intentions who want to promote nature and the friendship between man and dog must also have knowledge of the craft if they want to tell a credible story.
In this case it was unsuccessful.
There's a bit too much erotica in this good family film, and a minimum of dialogue for the genre.
Ani as an advertisement for cannabis would not have passed amateurishly.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to the incessant chirping of the sparrows, like you are.
The difference between offering and forcing, you can see it here, how it is understood, but it is only because you have never tried it.
The decision is always made by the customer, if the customer does not want an answer, the answer will always be no.
If you were such a kid and listened to the furt, you might change your opinion.
It is work like any other, in his case a brigade of workers.
Close East suffers from unusually dry months.
Zima is the only period in the year when it rains.
"Almost complete absence of rainfall during November, which we recorded at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term average rainfall for November.
The double rain this week was therefore an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, was pleased to say the inhabitants of Nazareth Wasím Aškar.
In Israel, rainfall comes almost exclusively in winter, in the form of showers, and is sporadic and unpredictable.
In winter, the forests are dependent on the rain.
Without them, they are prone to fires.
It's not just about the forest, but also about sources of drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Galilee lake, was filled to the brim this spring due to three last rainy winters.
Since then, the level has dropped.
Water managers have been warning of drought for a long time.
It is expected that, depending on global warming and changes in climate, there will be a decline in rainfall here, predicted Uri Schor, spokesman for the Israeli Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel is capable of helping using technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
The economically weaker countries like Lebanon, Syria or Jordan are suffering more.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, there are increasing numbers of tanker vehicles.
Water pipes and private wells are running dry.
This year, we have received orders for 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years, announced the driver of the tanker truck Imád Sulejman in September.
In the Iranian Isfahan, there were conflicts between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river was completely dry.
The region has the driest November in many years behind it.
Israel prepares military action against Iran
Israeli Defense Minister declared that negotiations in Vienna did not bring “any progress” and informed Washington about preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
On Saturday, Minister Benny Gantz declared that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military strike against Iran, informs Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is staying in the USA, is attempting to persuade Americans to crank up the pressure on Iran, but he is also informing Washington about military preparations.
Speaking at a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had failed to make "any progress" and that world powers "realize that Iranians are playing with them."
This happened to me about 3 years ago.
I flirted a little and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wants.
In the end, I discovered that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Since I really don't like these kinds of tricks, I asked the young lady a few questions and doubts and then thanked her and left.
Calmly tell me that I'm an idiot, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers set off into the mountains at the weekend; there was plenty of snow and great weather
Mountain centres in the Czech Republic have seen the first big influx of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After the heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski areas have started operating.
Sjezdaře were not deterred even by the obligation to prove themselves with a covid certificate at the start.
While ski resorts are not worried about lack of interest from customers, some ski equipment rental shops are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the pandemic.
Thousands of people went running and skiing in the Liberec Region over the weekend.
The skiers were cheered on by the weather, which today offered sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
We are pleased that the opening weekend really started with the evening skiing on Friday, when we had the first skiers on the hill, praised the director of the Sport Areal Ještěd Jakub Hanuš.
Crowds of people also headed for the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend of skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Aréna Karlov or the centre in Branná on the Sumperk were opened.
The weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today an estimated 400 people came.
The conditions are suitable.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so it was perfect, and I am not ashamed to praise the representative of the ski centre in Branná, Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators may only sell ski passes to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered from COVID-19.
People are prepared for this and show the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre told the ČTK.
We only recorded individual incidents, he added.
Some rental and retail outlets for ski equipment are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
The biggest influx is expected during the period of ski courses.
David Šinták, managing director of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, also feels that there is less interest in renting ski equipment due to Covid.
We were almost bankrupt before the pandemic.
Compared to the pre-pandemic period, we are around 50 percent, said ČTK Šinták.
According to him, people got used to the pandemic and learned to stay at home.
On the other hand, there is a lot of demand at the Novako rental on Boží Dar.
They have been renting out skis there for a week now and interested parties must now book them in advance.
We are renting out skis this weekend, but people have been calling ahead, so we are expecting a lot of interest, just like last year, said the operator of the area Pavlína Nováková.
She says the interest is comparable to that before the pandemic for skiing schools.
If we want successful and rich people to stay here, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life like abroad.
Certainly not socialist healthcare, where it is not always possible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Foreigners are leaving clever and skilled people who have no property here.
The owner of the company will not go abroad just like that.
I fully agree with the rest.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic, and if these people don't see any prospects in the Czech Republic, then they simply won't live here.
Emigration from Hungary started when Orbán won, when he governed for a year and suddenly hundreds of thousands left the country.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic could not find itself in a similar situation overnight.
Another question is the elections themselves.
If you live like a pig here, you can also win some traditional V4 madman.
The young and well-educated will leave, while his supporters and people whose assets cannot be transferred into the plane will remain.
Scary photo!
Was Langmajer killed for a bet on beer?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the film crew, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor then posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or just acting because of filming?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech.
She was last seen on her way home.
“The disappearance of Petra is totally out of character and we are getting increasingly worried about her,” Lucy O’Connor, from Lambeth police, said in a video released on Saturday, where Srncová worked.
Her family in the Czech Republic is very worried about her and wants to know where she is, she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work around 7.45pm on Sunday November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Someone from her colleagues reported her missing on December 3.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "healthcare assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.
We have enormous fears for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing, said the group of healthcare facilities in a twitter post.
We are appealing to anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police, the statement continued.
MP Harriet Harman also urged the public to cooperate, drawing attention to the case of Sinclair at a press conference on Saturday.
She has been missing for a few days, she is only 32, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are naturally devastated, said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
I have the feeling that we all have a special responsibility to try to find her, because she was away from her home country, away from her family and worked here for our health service, said Harmanová.
Police have already arrested one man in connection with the case and he remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC's news website, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what he is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I do not underestimate Ukraine either.
They are not a "huge amount", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
You notice that Ukraine constantly repeats that the threat of invasion is exaggerated and that our entry has teeth.
I am above.
I don't know on what he based his assumption that Russia wants a war.
The war is very expensive and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Compared to the situation in 38, it is so different in so many ways that I don't even know where to start.
I can already compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can't imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex these odd republics.
That is all and this "concentration" at the borders would correspond to that.
Yes, pacta sunt servanda...
In Prague, new timetables will apply from Sunday, affecting mainly suburban services
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport (PID) system can expect a few changes from Sunday, mainly in suburban services.
New lines were created, some changed their routes, and others disappeared altogether.
The integrated system is being joined by Mladoboleslavsko.
From Sunday, fast trains from České Budějovice will stop at the Zahradní Město station in the main city.
In suburban rail transport, trains S7 run, which on the route from Beroun to České Budějovice pass through Prague main station.
In the recently opened station of Prague-Zahradní Město, the fast train R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov will stop.
PID is expanding into new areas.
In addition, buses will run to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses will be introduced on the Mladoboleslavska line, including lines that cross over into the Liberec and Hradec Kralove regions.
The integration will result in the discontinuation of 77 lines, the introduction of 37 new lines, and the alteration of operations on 12 existing lines.
A new bus line 405 is being launched from Zličín in Prague, which will go as far as Žatec.
A new direct link has also been established between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled S53 train line.
They will be strengthened in the morning rush-hour and at weekends, when a new express service number 404 will start operating.
The PID system now also includes lines 400 and 410 travelling to the Liberec region.
They set off from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nádraží Holešovice station.
The main line 400 passes through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected services continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The supplementary line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubá to Doks, Mimoň and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the other hand, there are new cancellations or reductions in the operation of a dozen of central Bohemian local lines, including those to Mochov, Dobris and Rozmital pod Tresminem.
All trains with departure from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines from Prague to Beroun, Prague to Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín.
Passengers can expect changes in other places too.
Buses replace some of the cancelled railway lines or extend the section on line 420 from Dobříš with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets as far as Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have been changed and some bus routes on the border between central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Plzeň region have been amended.
Healthy snack/lunch from the supermarket to the office
Hello, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with an hour for lunch, and my only option to get lunch is to go next door to Billy or a bit further down to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, after work I have no strength to train, so I have to eat as healthily and dietarily as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a rush I'll buy a maximum of pizza and a dessert of yogurt and apple.
The question is: what healthy food would you recommend I buy in the supermarket without having to heat it up?
Not everyone is waiting for a metre of snow like you, unfortunately.
It's not about trees that you have to see.
Only the top of the tree can be hidden under the snow.
If it is damaged, the tree may be more prone to fungal diseases.
I maintain that it is the only reason they ban us from riding outside of the designated areas, but it is one of them.
Dara's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I did not enjoy it at all
The Czech showbiz pond has been living for nothing but revealing the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd since Thursday.
They've been dating since the summer, and the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent her fans a long message explaining why she kept her love for half a year.
I agree with you that currently there is no-one in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia whom it would surprise that Dara caught the bear, so pardon, Nedvěd, says Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer up to his ears.
But he didn't throw it away, on the contrary.
The three days are in the spotlight, and even though they are used to public attention, they don't derive any joy from it.
Here it is.
We didn't know what to expect, but we knew it would happen sooner or later, the singer continues.
I don't know who is worse.
Is it you, who don't give a damn and jump to judge, or us, whose lives you dissect in detail?
As if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you get on with your husband or wife or not, or whether you've stuck at it and made everyone know a list of all your exes and their failings.
That's the way it is, you want it, Daře doesn't like it.
The pair met up in Italy, where Rolins was preparing her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been working there as the vice president of the football club Juventus for a long time.
They only came out now because they were waiting for the conclusion of Nedvěd's divorce.
He has been separated from his wife, Ivana, for three years, but they have only been officially separated for three weeks.
Anyway, thank you to those who are happy for us and wish us well.
We are just people, with families, children, pasts and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
I love my new man and just like him, I'm standing by him. In good and in bad, Rolins concluded.
Hello, other commenters have probably already said everything important, so I just confirm that the halls are great at the beginning, my classmates usually meet in the first semester or two and become friends and find accommodation together, which is the best option for me because you know with whom you will be living.
Most of the time the flats are not advertised for a long time in advance, so now you probably won't find anything, but looking at the offer certainly won't do any harm.
In any case, it's not just Cejlu, but the surrounding area (streets such as Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that is a really bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří quarter is very student-y, Královo Pole way and that direction is fine, besides, it is close to the majority of VUT faculties (I don't know, where exactly you get off).
I've never rented a room, but I'm a native of Brno, so I could possibly advise you on Brno as such, if you need any additional information.
That is an example of my "completely normal" thinking.
It is actually completely in order that the state does not finance certain schools adequately, due to the decision of several doctors to do something somewhere in Poland.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it themselves or they go according to the state and pay for it from the state.
Nevertheless, we cannot allow a private actor to dominate a part of the education system just because a couple of crowns happen to fall into its lap, and as a result, it will be able to teach whatever it wants in schools.
Such allegations lose some of their weight when written by a person who two days earlier expressed himself in a similar way about the petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a vote against abortion is for you the same as a vote against a statue being placed in a square?
It would be best to consult this with the person who gave you the work.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloguing/digitisation that (and even long-term professionals) that it is either somehow alright on the eye, or they will write something along the lines of xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and add a note that it is unreadable.
It is true that in this case it is quite readable so I would not recommend it at all.
Personally, I would deal with it in a note somewhere according to which program you use.
If you want to be a decent and diligent student, you can look up some sign language databases and find the nearest one.
However, since it appears that you are citing from a book, I would hazard a guess that the author or printer has created their own monogram, which sits well with the design of the coin.
PS: Is it not more of a coincidence that the Odryan Kingdom is the Odryan Empire?
PSS: Someone has already trashed it here.
Mrkni on this comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That is much worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that someone would vote for something they don't understand is laughable.
All the important approved documents are being scrutinised, word by word; it is not enough just to have some basic knowledge of English, that is the job of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various institutions of the EU; English is more suitable for informal contacts and the establishment of above-standard relationships for politicians.
What is more, it is quite interesting in connection with the withdrawal of Great Britain from the EU.
I don't want to go to jail.
I've been working there for three years and I'm completely at ease.
I drive home from work at 10 at night and never have any problems.
Only someone who almost never goes there can say it is a ghetto.
Jo, most of the Romani people of Brno live there, but the only thing they do is to impede pedestrians and park their cars where they shouldn't :D certainly I wouldn't be afraid to walk there in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap accommodation with good access to the centre, I'd be happy to go there.
There are now a lot of new flats there that have been reconstructed or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda and girlfriend Gelemová as a stake in the fence!
With whom will you spend Christmas?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dad's wreath and Lucie certainly had one too, said the Blesk saxophonist, who thus confirmed Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their home in Vinohrady, where Dáda remained alone after his departure.
Slováček still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently we met with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: AGAIN TOGETHER!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: AGAIN TOGETHER!
We were talking about something, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I will be.
We are buying presents all the time and I am sure I will buy something for my dad and Lucia, maybe perfume.
I am a gentleman, said Felix, who came to the christening of the musical video clip in the Richman club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
You always find someone to have fun with, says Slováček, who was glad to meet the wife of Ludek Sobota, Adrian, or singer Kamila Nývltová.
He made it clear.
Can we afford not to have soldiers and weapons on our island?
I doubt that anyone will defend us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
Can you explain to me why that would be a bad argument?
I don't know of any other component that could be used in hospitals in a crisis.
There are too few police officers and they cannot afford it, so only the firefighters and no one else has such a high percentage of medically trained people at this level.
It is a disgrace that our army is capable of defending Ostrava in the face of previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for too long.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside should not only be a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has disappeared from mountainous and foothill areas, and smaller amounts of precipitation are being recorded in places where drought has not yet been a problem.
The cause of the drought, which is affecting much of Central Europe, is climate change.
But it also emphasizes the way we manage the soil.
What should one do in connection with the drought?
How can we help nature in difficult times?
That's how it will be, provided I stay on my skates on the ice, I know how to play with mushrooms and that tactic (which I've tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is generally rubbish.
It doesn't matter whether you are a hockey team "Medved Russia" or "Lama China", if you lose by two goals, it's a different feeling than when the game is tied.
Anyway, as it is, I'm listening to Czech commentators who are picking out what the referees don't see, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all crazy, but that's how it is with all sports, UEFA and the "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
In my opinion, if it was the other way around, it would be as always, and that the Czech Republic has more often lost to Russia than won, maybe it would be a classic "they lost" vs "WE WON".
Coronavirus: Number of cases in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily cases.
There are 5,766 people in hospital.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic and another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of cases in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new cases have been registered.
This is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered cases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1,132, the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain is facing a "inevitable" major surge in cases caused by Omicron, said Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser to Public Health England, on Sunday on TV.
New quarantine measures will be necessary.
People infected with the Omicron variant are already being hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins is expecting the number to grow.
So far no one has died of omikron, but people are being hospitalized about 14 days after infection and dying about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street in December, when the lockdown was in place and Christmas parties were banned.
Every minister in Johnson's government defended the quiz, saying it took place "virtually" via computer.
However, Downing Street was attended by groups of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from the premiership.
During the last December, when the lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers organized numerous meetings despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are outraged that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor commercial TV ITV for Britain: Two years ago, Boris Johnson won a resounding majority in the general election.
Today, the Conservative Party will talk about removing him from his position as prime minister.
It is remarkable how quickly events developed.
Do you want to tan and save your skin?
Hungary awaits the elections in spring, which may end the eight-year government of Viktor Orbán.
These elections are of great importance to the whole of Europe.
How long must we wait for fairness?
Never give up.
They will probably not be free either, because there were no free elections under Orbán either.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes electoral districts to benefit from that, and does other small or big tricks.
So far, the last one sounds like this: everyone can in practice vote where they want.
To allow Fidesz to bring voters from districts where the outcome is certain to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could win.
So just pretend they don't exist.
Do you think it will be the same as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Before, it was a matter of whether Fidesz would win, but by how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that the united opposition will win more votes and mandates.
It is a great exception for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Would you like to play even harder to keep the power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are prepared to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently leaked to the independent media was a recording of the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz László Kövér, where he explains to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
What are the signs of this new approach?
Yes, it is one of those innovations.
Everything starts with language.
I've been bitten quite often, the last time was at 14, my parents aren't very patient, nor am I, my dad's had it for a long time, but then it starts to itch (just in connection with me).
At the same time I am very choleric and I used to get angry a lot as a little girl, to the point that I lay on the ground crying and was completely blue, twice they had to hold me under the shower to calm me down.
Sometimes I felt like I was being educated, sometimes it was more that they didn't know.
I definitely have a tendency nowadays to solve things violently, as a child I was quite a handful, now I just scream and shout and as a teenager you just do as your parents tell you to (so they don't have too much power over you), so I've never done anything extreme, but I've always had that urge.
I'm not able to determine how much of that is my explosiveness, but certainly the training has its part too.
I am afraid that I will also lose patience with my children and solve it the same way.
I think that beating children is simply wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not at a time when it wasn't "educational" but rather out of frustration; on the other hand, perhaps every parent simply does something they later regret, so I won't judge.
It does not bother me at all; I do not understand why OP should be ashamed of something.
Laws must be clear and unambiguous.
Therefore, I will call you what the laws are in such quality.
I was also interested in whether you are afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on the fact that people want to buy the product and will pay for it?
Kočner's crazy world.
Is Slovakia moving the process with the murder of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial in the case of the killing of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It stirred up the public, but also exposed the practices of businessman Marián Kočner, who was on trial, and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How fundamental will the process be for Slovakia?
Journalists can write about this.

The next government concludes and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage is nowhere
Minister Karl Havlicek's proposal needs to be thoroughly reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is coming to an end, and the law intended to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected during the selection and permitting of a high-level radioactive waste repository does not exist.
The government's legislative council halted debate on the proposal, which the government had submitted after lengthy delays from the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities united in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Municipal authorities are expecting a significant boost to their powers in deciding on a repository, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is demanded by the Czech nuclear law and European directives.
We expect that the new government, in line with its coalition agreement, will work on the proposal in cooperation with municipalities.
The draft law from Minister Karla Havlíčková, which is available to the Platform, is criticised by the communes, in particular, as follows: The proposed level of involvement of communes and the public in the process of choosing a location for a repository is inadequate and cannot ensure respect for the interests of communes and their citizens.
It can be truly effective only if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location at all.
To ensure this, it is necessary to stipulate that the depositary shall obtain the consent of the affected municipalities before commencing the specific proceedings.
The submitted proposal for a material objective practically ignores the involvement of the public and makes citizens into mere statistics in the granting of permits.
The proposal is missing a systematic setting of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a location for storage, its approval and operation.
According to today's legal regulations, representatives of municipalities do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a site for a depot.
Only in some regulatory proceedings may submit their comments or appeal, but the authority or the minister decides, in whose interest is the permit issued.
Any possible complaint will not delay the performance of exploratory or construction works.
The decentralisation of decision-making that the Platform is calling for is a principle that is widely used in many democratically developed countries and certainly in those that have already progressed in licensing storage, such as Sweden and Finland.
The preparation of the bill is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the HAVEL & PARTNERS law firm, which SÚRAO concluded and which follows on from contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total sum for these works is almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the locality of Hrádek and a spokesperson for the Platform against Deep Mining Storage said: "After the ministers of industry, who merely passed the responsibility for seeking a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste on to their successors, we await a significant change of direction from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We are also grateful for the support of the Association of Towns and Municipalities, which views the issue of insufficient rights for municipalities in relation to such a fundamental building in the same way as the directly affected municipalities in the selected locations.
The platform against the deep geological repository unites 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) for the purpose of promoting a change in the state's approach to dealing with burnt-out nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to the deep geological repository.
The platform further proposes that the decision on the selection of a location for possible storage should be conditional on the prior agreement of the affected municipalities.
Herce Johna Goodmana (69) was not afraid of the weight: He lifted 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for a long time, doctors eventually scared him.
They told him that if he did not lose weight, he would die.
It was taken away.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kg, The Sun newspaper reports.
He proudly presented his new role at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles.
The guy from the sitcom Roseanne is completely different!
John loved to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body was breaking the furniture.
I did it all, the actor said in an interview with AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Run, exercise.
I'm getting to the age where I can't afford to sit down, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It depends on who the boss is and what you want to use the word "boss" for.
If it is some text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I would not translate it at all.
If it was a text that was formal or academic, I would probably try to describe or explain it.
After all, there are more types of bosses.
A game like Dark Souls, for example, has several bosses, and then there's the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), which are not necessary to defeat in order to complete the game or level, but are often stronger than standard bosses.
There are games such as Half-Life, where the bosses are there, but the player does not come face to face with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), so what can they be called?
There are no mini bosses.
It is practically impossible to translate the boss's single-worded name into Czech, or any other language for that matter ( Catalan is interesting in that it translates the boss as the final opponent).
That is, in short, the story or the game generally important, computer-controlled, stronger than all previous opponents and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is looking for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also joined in.
British police have been searching for Petra Srnková since December 3.
The search was joined by the Czech police.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherský Brod has been missing since December 7.
Through Interpol, he is also helping the British police.
Her colleagues last saw Czech Petra Srnková on November 28.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular because of her.
So Peter is searching the whole world.
The Czech police cooperate closely with the British police, police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
We share information on the case, she added.
The search for Petra, which has been announced, has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimetres tall, is small and has brown eyes and long, straight hair the same colour.
It is supposed to have come from Uherský Brod.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, as such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
The search for Peter was joined by local MP Harriet Harman.
She joined in the hanging of posters with Petra's face on them.
We have huge concerns about it, she said at the press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already arrested one suspect.
But it is not clear who it is about and what Petra had in common with them.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decrease in attacks, the last month with the approach of the end of the year attacks intensified significantly.
We recorded a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The attached file in the e-mail should alert the user with its name, which refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month's malicious attachment had the word "invoice" in its name, this time it was called "Copy of account statement for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains functions that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The harmful code actively seeks out stored login data and then sends it to attackers.
The last strong campaign occurred in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of attackers is growing again.
In November, the spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, in this case the attackers are not targeting the Czech Republic in particular, and security experts in November detected rather campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the November data from the Formbook, it has weakened slightly, but it still accounts for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the entire month, with increased activity on November 3rd, 10th and 15th.
The formbook usually contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
But the name of the account continues to appear.
The attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts have noticed a significant drop in activity by the Fareit programme, which was responsible for 1.6 per cent of attacks, and in the Czech Republic there has been no large-scale attack campaign for several months.
Today's demo of clever people who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The procession through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the footage from the procession along the quay and according to my experience of a demonstrator, I estimate that around 10,000 people took part.
People in the procession filled the quay and the bridge and the opposite quay.
It means that people really care.
A spontaneous crowd of several thousand demonstrators is joined by an unexpected number of onlookers.
I maintain that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
The fact that lasting dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led them to find a common language.
The same goes for lone anti-vaxxers, anti-mosquito sprayers and the like, who would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The association Chcípl pes is becoming more and more popular, it reminds me of A Million Moments for Democracy.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and technology.
It's hard to say which movement could benefit from this discontent, it depends not only on the supply of money but also on whether the triple vaccine from Pfizer becomes a quadruple and multi-dose vaccine.
It will not be a leftist or centrist movement, that's for sure.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is clear that we will have to be vaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines saved us.
Brilliant action by scientists, to which humanity is entitled.
The End of Patu, Bulgaria Has a New Prime Minister Announcing Change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev entrusted the formation of the new government to Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement Continuing the Change, which won the November elections.
Tomu has already managed to put together a broad coalition which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the former government lost elections due to the weight of anti-corruption protests.
Victorious parties declaring war on bribery and abuse of power failed to agree, however, so there have been two snap elections so far.
What do cats do when nobody is watching?
The clip is a global hit.
In Britain, fears grew over the weekend for the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman, who London police have been hunting for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago, when she was driving home from work in the south of the British metropolis.
According to information, in addition to the police, her previous employer or the MP representing the part of London where she lived are also being called.
“The disappearance of Petra is totally out of character and we are getting increasingly worried about her,” Lucy O’Connor, from Lambeth police, said in a video released on Saturday, where Srncová worked.
Her family in the Czech Republic is very worried about her and wants to know where she is, she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work around 7.45pm on Sunday November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Someone from her colleagues reported her missing on December 3.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "healthcare assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.
We have enormous fears for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing, said the group of healthcare facilities in a twitter post.
We are appealing to anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police, the statement continued.

In Ústí nad Labem, a month-long hole in the road took the form of a canal without a cover.
It was about life.
The magistrate referred the complaints to the ŘSD, which owns the road, and since it did not react, the pothole got worse.
Finally, the authorities explained the responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the ŘSD started "intensively dealing with the situation".
