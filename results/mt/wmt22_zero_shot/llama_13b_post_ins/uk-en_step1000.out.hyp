Good day, excuse me for not having internet and not being able to send it sooner. Thank you.
Could you please tell me the exact address where to go for cleaning tomorrow, the code to the keys and what time the guests are leaving tomorrow and when the new guests are arriving?
Unfortunately, I must decline your offer because I have already found a job.
I'm sorry, but I can't refuse there.
Sometimes it seems to me that my thoughts in Czech are different from those written by me in Ukrainian.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Good day, I agree to the course.
However, could you please tell me if it's an earlier time?
But I don't live in Prague, there may be difficulties with transport.
If there are no other options, I'm okay with it.
Thank you in advance.
In Herson people came to a rally again, Russians did not manage to disperse it
Participants of the event told the agency that Kherson residents had held a rally before the military arrived for dispersing the crowd.
We managed to hold a rally. The technical equipment of the Russian Federation has now arrived there, - one of the participants in the event reported.
In the past, residents traditionally gathered for protests on Freedom Square - near the ODA and regional council buildings.
The square is currently controlled by armed Russian forces, who are using weapons against participants in the rallies and kidnapping people.
As reported, armed Russian occupants used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka on April 3.
As reported by Ukrinform, residents of Donetsk regularly carry out peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
Russian military uses force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detainees.
Russian invaders also abduct inhabitants of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded the title of "Hero City" to Herson.
On 24 February, President Putin began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, conducting massive shelling of residential areas in Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.

I can cook, the main thing is to have a recipe, but I like to bake a cake.
In Ukraine, traditional dishes include borscht, varenyky, and others.
I don't have a favorite dish, I love trying various dishes from different countries.
What do you like to eat? Do you like to cook?
I want to be busy with something.
More precisely, there is a train, but no seats
Sorry, but we're a little late.

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, stop fighting - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battles for eastern Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will define the course of the war ‚Äì and if the Armed Forces of Ukraine suffer defeat there, the Russians may leave negotiations and once again occupy the territories they had evacuated.
Straight talk: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It is fighting - we are fighting, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, our positions will be weaker.
They (the city's defenders ‚Äì ed.) are people who have attracted a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the country, in (the area of) the OOS, and if they are stronger, the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these directions, we may not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will do all these steps that can lead to the return even to those cities that we have now de-occupied.
They may go for it.
Then our negotiating position will be weaker and even uninteresting for the Russian side.
Alas, we are constrained to note.
We believe in our result, in our victory...".
Details: Zelensky also said that it is hard to go for negotiations after torturing the Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the possibility of a diplomatic solution, if they will be".
Straight talk: "People will accept the world as it is, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, on the terms of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think that any peace on any terms will satisfy them.
But if we speak dispassionately, the war must end in peace, or end with millions of victims.
And even there, where a million victims, everything comes to an end with the war.
So, we have to fight ‚Äì but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing else to fight for, when there are no people left."
Good afternoon, do you have any free places on the course of Czech for adults from 19:00 on Tuesday?

I'll try to do it quickly, but I won't promise.
I will write to you when the apartment is ready for guests.
Dominika, who makes purchases of materials?
Is this procedure permanent or do I need to order it as I run out?
In connection with the change in the esthetic of Ukrainian literature, new concepts are needed to describe its new qualitative state.
The analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
The Ukrainian poetic metaphor in contemporary literature allows to analyze the postmodern context as such, where the metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion.

I'm looking for work... but there's a problem, I can't stay on my feet for long after the operation, so it's very difficult for me to find something suitable for me.
I'm staying in Prague 9 at the moment. I'm ready to move anywhere as long as there's work. I'll be very grateful for any advice or suggestions.
But if you don't want to talk to me, I'll be sad
Why did you believe that such an experience was not necessary for you?
Every situation is given for something.
Primarily, to change a person, especially spiritually.
I will send you this money as the bank approves it.
About 30,000 hryvnias to pay off debts, another 30,000 to live on.

The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine made public a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the committing of military crimes in the city of Bucha, Kyiv region.
As reported by Ukrinform, the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reports this in Facebook.
Every Ukrainian must know their names!
The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine received a list of military personnel of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade, who directly participated in committing military crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha," the report says.
According to the Ministry of Defense, all war criminals will be brought to justice and held accountable for crimes against the civilian population of Ukraine.
The full list can be found here.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and the entire Kiev region were freed from Russian invaders.
Mass killings of civilians by Russian military have been recorded in the liberated cities and villages.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoly Fedoruk reported that 280 people were buried in the mass grave.
General Prosecutor Iryna Venediktivna stated that on April 3, 410 bodies of civilians killed in action were transported from the territory of the Kiev region, which had been liberated from Russian occupiers.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian invaders' troops shell and destroy key infrastructure facilities, carry out massive shelling of residential areas in Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers, ballistic missiles, and aviation bombs.
Good day, I apologize, but I will not be able to work for you, as I will be flying to Canada shortly.

I thought in a week, but the situation is heating up, the sirens are constantly on
There may be bad connection on the road tomorrow.
I am grateful to every person for the experience, even if it is painful.
I consider that I have learnt a lesson from each situation so as not to repeat mistakes in the future.
Directives are introduced in the form of numbered written amendments, which are part of this Regulation.
I am confident that this problem will be solved.

We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It is great, I have money for two months of rent, the district of Oloomucia is not important, I will be very grateful.
Most of my friends are deeply shocked by news of the savage treatment of the civilian population to the north of Kyiv.
Photographs of tortured and shot people horrified the whole civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how it was possible in the 21st century?! How?!
I was not surprised at all. Just what I had feared was happening...
I evacuated children and elderly parents from Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then girls-colleagues with children, and only after this returned to the capital to work.
I have been helping the army since 2014 and have never doubted for a single moment that my family would be killed if the suburbs of Kyiv were occupied.
But I remain absolutely convinced that the essence of the rotten communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
It simply cannot exist without terrorism, it is built on terrorism.
In 1937, one of my grandfathers was shot dead in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago in the Zhytomyr SBU they gave a copy of the grandfather's execution file: the whole case is over a hundred pages, but the verdict for the death sentence is very simple and even more terrible because of that.
The defendant was illiterate, denied his guilt.
The ethnic Pole, Catholic, had five children, was a free man, poor "one-dwelling" nobility, and never walked in serfs.
The fact that they lived in a hut and had several cows was enough to sentence the peasant and the nurse to death.
Relatives did not even learn about the place of burial.
The grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and that all of them were killed except for two who agreed to give false testimony.
The criminal case has the name of the striker Sharij.
Our former speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics, so I'm not surprised that his relative was a KGB informer.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, as they say...
The execution squad that sentenced the peasants to death were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his grandfather, he was interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (no sarcasm intended) information resources in Russia, such as the "Immortal Barrack," which qualitatively remind one of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVD found ways to punish and exterminate almost all those who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers, the system first discredited and then destroyed.
As if on a computer they found child pornography files, put him in jail, and he died there quickly.
The KGB kills those who try to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
What are you surprised by their actions now?!
The most disgusting features of human nature are concentrated there.
Over the thousand-year-old nomadic tradition were superimposed slavery and imperial racism of the 16th-19th centuries.
And then, on top of that, they conducted a bestial genetic experiment, lopping off intellectuals during several waves of red terror.
Take a look at the semi-French film "Checkist" from 1992 - that's how it was.
So you saw my photo in a swimsuit
Can you ask your wife what I can buy for a cold?
I'm sorry, but I don't have anyone to ask.
I also wanted to ask if you know where the children went because Galya cannot recognize them
Lyubosh, Igor asks if it's convenient for you to go tomorrow? (he's off and may go, as they haven't looked at his car at the station today).
It is very inconvenient for us to worry you so much.
You help us a lot, thank you!

What do the girls do when they return from school?
We arrived at the place where we were settled from the center in Pardubice, the conditions are good.
But there is a big BUT here: men drink alcohol and smoke inside, loud music is minimal, what could have caused a mess, drunken guys and us with children... It's terrible to sleep when you're honest.
Be so kind to help with housing, for money's sake.
But where it will be safe and not smoky.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is so strong that it seems like they are actually smoking here.
I very much ask you, one of them can hardly stand on his feet and screams, something displeases him. It's very scary.

I wanted to glance at the cake for Carina at least
I forgot to write to you, sorry.
Yesterday everything went very well.
We talked about children with special needs and the system of their education in Ukraine.
When Ms. Shakhova introduced me as an Fpoint employee, the first question was how we found the dog, how we found the poodle.
Everyone is watching the page on Facebook.
They asked to pass on their greetings and say how interesting it is for them to read the news.
We also talked about people of Romanian nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if the child comes and the parents don't understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them in the telephone mode.
I need to change the bed linen, 2 sets.
I'm fine with that on holidays.
I have free time and we only go to Easter services.
Today I will write my data for work
The data is very interesting, thank you for organizing
So, in Nesterov there is only a sniff of flu, while in Halinka the temperature is 37.7 degrees in the evening and 38 degrees at night.
There is a very long queue for General Chapek.
Everyone has a chance.
The main thing is that love is real and mutual.
I don't know how it is in Europe, but in our country, people get married for various reasons, mostly mercenary, commercial goals.
And I have this problem, if I don't love a person nothing will work.
So, we took her home and brought her aunt right away.
She was so grateful, she cried.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said that if it were possible, there would be an old blanket and pillow.
But this is not obligatory. Only if. I am also very grateful to you.
I'm really sorry for him.
They killed my best friend.
I had a lot of questions to God about why situations kept happening in my life that just made me lose hope in everything.
And the small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made a collection
It's like that, but we're not oriented in the area and we don't know where everything is. We looked for a supermarket for an hour and a half and walked back. Two blankets are not suitable, so two large ones are needed
Even now, I thought about you, and you wrote to me.
Does your dad speak Russian or anyone else in the family?
It is possible that the children came to Valya and played in the hall
Well, let's risk it then :)
I am also glad to have met you.
I talked to Vladimir about housing, and he advised me to keep looking, or to look for myself, because some people who live with us said that we need to go to the Museum metro station, where there is an organization that helps find housing.
Because of the little one, I'll jump over the barrier üòÇüôÇüòÇ
I don't know the answers to some of their questions
It was good on Thursday, if possible
I can't call the doctor because I haven't got a food hygiene certificate yet.
But I can't call him back because I've run out of money on my account.
I can't recharge my phone because I don't understand the Czech online banking and I can't recharge it from a Ukrainian bank card.
In the Vodafone app I cannot change the tariff so that I have normal calls and internet to top up my number.
I'm already losing my mind

But there is now a question mark over all of it.
Yes. The size for 10-11 years. But our sizes do not coincide. We need to measure everything
I am looking for everything for the house and for the child.
Thank you for accepting me as I live in the chapel. They always ask me if I need anything, and I am ashamed to say that I ask for it myself.
I just got home, now I'm having breakfast :)
Don't explain anything, be kind, do what I would do if I were there
It is impossible to answer without a resume.
I can't tell Mom that :)
And it's not quite real to me right now that I couldn't hold it together before we left the apartment....Like tonight....
God, give me strength. Maybe I'll lie down right away, get some sleep.
I will write to you in any case.
Hello. Could you help me, Susana? I received my payment for March. I can't figure out why such amount.

Flowers were blooming. Everything was normal. Everyone had a great time.
As reported by "European Truth," Welt writes this, citing sources in the Ukrainian government circles.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economics on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including training kits and spare parts, amounts to ‚Ç¨1.7 billion.
Howitzers are also offered in a version mounted on a Boxer armoured vehicle for ‚Ç¨120 million.
While tanks have to get relatively close to their targets in combat, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at distances of over 30 kilometres.
As reported by the Ukrainian government with reference to the proposal of KMW, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will pass according to the circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible term, and the gaps created will be filled by industry in the second phase.
The first new howitzers could be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed until 2027.
And we in the first half of the day, or in the second half of the day together?
We will find a way to help you. I will write to you. Thank you.
I am going to work tomorrow without passing the commission, and then when my doctor recovers, will I pass the commission honestly?

For me, marriage is a mystery between two people who do not discuss one another with their relatives or friends.
The husband and wife themselves decide the issues in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we are together.
Why not try it this way?
I rented a car for nine people, we will come with Mariana and your family.

I am a massage therapist and rehabilitation specialist looking for work.
So that the children could go to school and I could work, we needed housing not far from civilization.
I just had to win today!
Nothing. We'll see tomorrow. I didn't know that even big stores would be closed.
We prepare the pigeons like this: in a saucepan, dilute the tomato paste with 0.5 liters of water 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste - until it boils.
I put the pigeons in a saucepan and pour the sauce over them.
It takes about 1.5 hours to roast the turkey in the oven.
How much money do I have on this number?
I must bring all this.
From Monday 4.

The office in hall 29 is specifically for filing and processing applications for assistance, which is why there is an interpreter there.
Lidiya is already enrolled in school, but we will go to the teacher on Tuesday because of illness, I told her today.
I sit, put on headphones, listen to music and think about you and the children.
I really want to be with you.
To make you happy üò¢.
I don't know, honey, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I put it this way, that we are together. That we are a pair.
I would say that after the war, there will be a lot of work.
Therefore, I am not afraid that I will not find her there.
I know a lot.
Therefore, I am not afraid that I did not get into any of them.
But I don't know what will happen to our home.üò¢üò¢üôÅ
I need to pass an inspection for a food production license. Can you help me with this?
Could you please prepare the apartment for 5 guests tomorrow?
Do you understand fifth place in the room with the TV?
Unfold and spread the sofa?
Can we stop here while Ms. Margarita finds us a place to stay?
Don't worry about it.
Not new, which we have already used, but it works, but it is not necessary.
Write the address in Czech, look at the map where it is from us
I don't know how much space there is there so I can't plan anything with the furniture. I want to look at that apartment at last this week and then understand what furniture I need
Excuse me for such a long answer, it was a working day, hard to adapt
Is this enough?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe and I want to finally be with you, to have that chance to hold you in my arms.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how you look.
For the child there is already a bed and a washbasin, things have been found for the first time
Don't forget that you promised to help me, as you will have the opportunity, but not the last to give ü§´üòüüôÉüòâ
I want to make a haircut that is called a bob.
Oleg was ill - high fever and cough. It's better if you don't bring Yana with you, so she doesn't get infected
I'll be a little later - around 8. Is that okay?
I don't want misunderstandings with you
But I'm worried that everything will be okay!?
But we didn't even mention this to them!
I understand how important this is for you!
As for me, I'm silent (for me it's just a peak that can't be reached)!
How do you feel today? After the celebration?
Hello, sorry, I just woke up, didn't sleep well
Excuse me for troubling you.
I was upset that we didn't start translating the test well with Kolya yesterday.
I will ask either Grigory Denisenko or Yonashenko to help me a little with the mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be useful to them?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to review mathematical terms over the weekend.
Geometry is generally difficult, but we need to work with Colle to get it right.
Thank you for the test tasks
We also hope for this very much
And so she is very happy with any present
I wanted to connect my Czech number to the internet
Yesterday, at bus stop 402, I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl - a child, but here she is alone... her eyes full of tears and pain...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed to be friends.
And yesterday evening, thanking God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine who felt my heart.
The office in hall 29 is specifically for filing and processing applications for assistance
It turned out that I ordered a backup card
It's not for me, I'm a simple person.
So she wouldn't be afraid that no one came
I didn't go. I baked it myself. I can do it! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the gas.
So, do you leave the city for a long time?
A year ago, in the Memorial Complex "Babyn Yar" in Kyiv, we honored the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
It was an honor for me to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He was talking about "common basis of international law and human dignity, people's freedom to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, peaceful and secure Europe.
This foundation we must defend ‚Äì it is also part of our responsibility, linked to our history."
If "the evil spirits of the past appear today in new clothes, then for us Germans there can only be one answer: never again!
The struggle must continue."
Today, Russia attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of peaceful citizens, starved the residents of the blockaded cities to death and let them die from diseases.
Russian troops are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, which even visually resemble the shootings in Babi Yar.
More than a month Germans see this in the news in real time.
Germany is implementing sanctions and providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which would have been unimaginable not long ago.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons necessary for Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to fight against the swastika.
This means fighting with all available means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy path without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities that are happening in Ukraine.
One song for you
We agree, let's arrange an excursion and write when to be gathered.
Everyone was sick, but Lidia was not sick. There was a new type of coronavirus.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I use this instead of a card
Ring for the delay of documents.
The ticket cost me 2000 hryvnias
Sergey Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO is no longer a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of those surveyed were "for".
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbass, the number of opponents of NATO began to fall, while supporters, on the contrary, began to grow.
After the beginning of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have recorded a record level of support among Ukrainian citizens for Ukraine entering NATO ‚Äì over 75%.
Despite the support of Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO is providing in wartime conditions, there is now a lot of criticism of the Alliance and its members - for the late supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, and the unwillingness to "irritate" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to refuse the goal of membership in the Alliance due to Russia's position, if this can stop the war, and Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In a new episode of the Cursed Questions podcast, together with the editor of European Truth we will be talking about how the Alliance has been helping Ukraine since the moment of the Russian aggression, what NATO should be criticized for and what for what the Alliance is criticized unjustifiably, why our prospects of membership in NATO are closer than ever, and why the security guarantees, which are being discussed at the negotiations with Russia, could become the second Budapest memorandum.
What do you think
My Volt partner noted what my statement was about.
I sent it through this mobile application
There is no visa, we need to go to the congress center and find out how to do it, because it was obtained in Poland, and they did not give a visa, but gave us a hard time.
We will definitely write to you!
Denis went out in a good mood today.
Arranged to meet with the boy from Ukraine whom he met yesterday, to show him everything near the school.
So, I hope that everything will be all right for him.
But I don't like it, I'm not enough for a long time
It is reported in Ukraine that the Czech Republic has sent tanks T-72 and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine.
I'm going to leave the children and come back in 3-4 years and go home because I can't stay any longer.
And take your brothers with you at 6-7 a.m.
So, there was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this person, but he didn't behave properly and I left him.
After some time he returned and asked for my forgiveness again.
I refused him.
Then after some time he called and said that they had operated on his heart.
Asking him to just chat with me, I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him almost half a year.
We talked a lot.
At the same time, I had problems at work.
His support helped me a lot at that time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I thought, maybe it's really necessary to look at him differently.
And he proposed to me to get married, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God Himself decided our fate.
What does being ready for marriage mean to you?
And he only speaks Czech
I wanted to say that I managed to find a place to live and I am very happy about it üôÇ I now have a place to live and be with my child.
Do you need to remind me again?
)) Because I helped to look after the children in the family.
Don't apologize. Just write which sentences you didn't understand.
I understand that the translator does not always translate the text correctly.
I don't know how to talk to a doctor and give a paper?

Maybe someone can help me. I need things for a woman size XS or S, height 165. Also for her daughters (8, 10, 12 years old). Thank you.
That time in Lidl I bought two packets and Mom bought two
It is very pleasant from your side, thank you.
You lifted my mood
Well, let's talk about something else, because I won't be able to sleep anyway, and I'll just fall asleep and dream that they're bombing...
God is never late, He is always on time.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I perfectly understand the price of unskilled work, and I understand that I will not be able to have such a job as I had in Kyiv here, and the money I earned in Kyiv I will not earn here now.
But I can't just sit and do nothing, because then all bad thoughts come into my head, so I have to occupy myself with some physical activity.
Documentation is carried out at the airport from 7 am to 7 pm, in other times you can just wait.

Gryshko began to cough, I want to ask what I can buy in the pharmacy.
I want to ask for advice.

Could you, please, tell me whether you have an approximate schedule of cleaning flats once a month in advance, even if it's just to get an approximate understanding of which days?
I don't remember this schedule at all )
The Russian army threatens to deliver missile strikes on Kiev: they say "they didn't do this before"
Konashenkov's direct quote: "We see attempts of diversion and strikes by the Ukrainian forces on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian Armed Forces will deliver strikes against decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, after which the Russian army has refrained."
Russia launched rocket attacks on Kyiv from the first days of the full-scale invasion of occupation forces of the Russian Federation in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian rockets, which were downed by the Ukrainian air defense system, fell on a multi-apartment house in the capital's Pozniaky district.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a multi-storey building on Valeriy Lobanovskiy Avenue.
On March 1, a Russian missile hit the television tower near Babyn Yar, killing five passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building over the South Railway Station.
On March 14, the debris of the missile launched by the occupants destroyed a house and a trolleybus on Kyiv's Kurenivka
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area in Vynogradar, killing one person and wounding another 19, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center on Vynogradar, as a result of which at least 4 people were killed.
Kyiv mayor Vitaliy Klytsko once again stated on April 13 that residents of the capital, who had evacuated the city, should not return yet.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still launch rocket attacks on Kyiv, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On 1 April, an oil depot near Belgorod in Russia exploded, apparently as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local authorities of Belgorod announced that a "Ukrainian mine" had allegedly fallen near the city.
Clearly, the elites in Washington, as well as in Berlin, are horrified by the very notion that NATO fighters might shoot down Russian bombers over Ukraine.
But Zelensky is talking less to them than to their voters and to society as a whole.
With his speeches in parliaments and before tens of thousands of people in the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces European nations, who elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this sophisticated blend of strength, eloquence and sometimes despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow countrymen already support this idea.
Paris and Brussels may be against speeding up Ukraine's accession, but the process is already underway.
I understand you, so we don't want to be considered cheats.
The money you collect is better given to those in greater need.
I can come to you and we can decide everything on the spot. I want to help no matter what

But I won't stop loving you, you're everything to me.
This loan is handled by a financial consultant.
So it will take a few days.
Katya asked if she could give her a password for the internet?

We are very happy and grateful that our Nika and grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!

I am a certified massage therapist and nurse with 27 years of experience in neurology.
We offer therapeutic massages, a rehabilitation gym for children and adults.
I speak Ukrainian, Russian and Czech languages fluently.
Contacts: - it would be great to have an email so that the Czechs could write to you via an interpreter, an SMS doesn't work, they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard and if they call, it's hard to agree on something.
Do you really not want this prize?
It helps people to see what they are worth and what they have to offer.

Tell me what you want, and I'll do it.
You didn't want me to write to you today... for some reason
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask for anything.
More precisely, today I ask for attention.
I want to say a lot today, so I ask for your patience.
Is everything okay with your imagination?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan purchases, holidays.
You have dreams.
You plan to buy that very dress you saw yesterday in the shopping centre.
Tomorrow evening, after work.
Your brain cannot process this.
He's chomping at the bit for the old reality.
You call your boss to find out if you should come to work today.
You decide to leave the children at home.
We'll see what happens.
There is hope... It won't last long.
Now ... to arrange ... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go? I don't have anyone and nowhere to go.
I had $50 in my pocket. Everything we spent was at home.
Many bosses didn't pay us for our work.
Where should I go? Who needs me? How should I provide for my children? Where should I live?
You can't take much with you.
You didn't take anything from home... to go 1000 kilometers.
You don't know if you will feed them tomorrow, or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children around all of Prague.
What next? No-one knows. How much longer? No-one knows. The children ask for sweets. You can't give them any. It's too expensive for you.
And we don't have any of that.
Our choice is - to stay there and to call children to danger, or to try to save ourselves here
She was very pleased with the hearts and things the children gave her when she came to the school

Here's a photo of the girl in English you taught me.
Well, what will you write tomorrow, will we meet or not, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning. We have enough resources. It would be great to know a person from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
Are you busy tomorrow? Don't want to meet after 4 p.m.?
What are your general impressions of the first week?
Yesterday Karina brought us the medicine and we took it.
I can work with lying patients and children with disabilities

Can I wash your clothes for you?
But there's only gel antibacterial
I'm not quite sure, but I'm not very familiar with the city... around half past eleven
What services/activities, in your opinion, are necessary/lacking for the elderly?
I don't know what to do, as there was no SMS from the bank and I did not take the bank card either, and the children deleted the bank application, which made me very upset
Then write to me, please, how will you go üôèüèª

These are the tractor drivers who actually go out to work under fire, because it is time to sow.
These are the bus drivers who are prepared to travel in convoys through the occupied territories today, to deliver aid and bring people back.
These are the heroic conductors who go to the zone of combat operations without fear, calm the refugees in the carriages and help the volunteers load humanitarian aid into the carriages at the peaceful stations.
These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are the communal workers who remove the rubbish under fire, repair water pipes and electricity lines to provide for people's needs.
These are the doctors and nurses who save people's lives 24 hours a day, without complaining, and who volunteer in their free time, gathering first-aid kits for the front line.
In our country, Ukraine, the juice is gone when the berries are tiny)
Say, please, little children - what age are you referring to?
Is 8 years old an acceptable age for my daughter?
I am looking for accommodation for us with our daughter for 3-4 days to come to the Czech Republic and hand over passports for obtaining a visa to Canada.
In Warsaw, there are a lot of people in the visa center and the online queue does not work.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far, it takes a long time by train, it will be hard for the child.
Therefore, she decided to look for accommodation in Prague or near it.
No, it's all right for us

The Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (FEDU) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine, and consists of premises for voting in embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises in foreign military bases where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents are stationed (in Kosovo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo).[1] The role of the district electoral commission for the Foreign Electoral District is performed by the Central Election Commission.
In the overseas electoral district there are only national elections: the election of the President and people's deputies and all-Ukrainian referendums.
Elections to local councils are not held in Zaporizhia.

Very tasty apples, what sort are they?
Head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak reported that Russia had begun a "fake operation" regarding weapons that our allies had given to us.
Straight talk from Yermak: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their own backwardness and are trying to 'sabotage' arms supplies by any means.
For example, one of the latest fake - allegedly the destruction of the S-300 air defense systems transferred by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What's next? We are familiar with the Russian scenarios. One of them has a name.
They can publish fakes showing that Ukrainian soldiers are allegedly surrendering with weapons to the allies, after which the weapons are massively transferred to the Russian army.
I immediately want to warn about such fakes.
But the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to the other world.
Excuse me, but I forgot to ask how much the kindergarten will cost per month and whether it will work in the summer?
Everyone gets an equal chance.
There are much more dubious stories, believe me.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence of Russian forces committing atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, with Moscow dismissing the reports as "provocation."
The killing, raping and maiming of civilians by Russian forces in Ukraine is worthy of condemnation, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told journalists in Wellington on April 4.
Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents "a violation of international law."
The claims came after reports that hundreds of unarmed civilians had been shot dead and dumped in mass graves or left lying in the streets in the suburb of Kiev, Bucha, by Russian forces who had occupied the area for several weeks.
The photographs, which appear to show bodies of civilian men with their hands tied behind their backs, have shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there are signs that Russian troops committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
What happened in Budapest requires a new round of sanctions and very clear steps, said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez stated that the Russian army could come so far as to commit a "genocide" in Bucha.
We are going to do everything so that those who committed these war crimes will not remain unpunished, said Sanchez in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a "provocation."
Without any evidence, she stated that the United States and NATO "ordered" the image to discredit Russia.
In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not cause any doubts about who "ordered" this story," Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defense also made unsubstantiated statements that the image of Bucha was "another provocation by the Kyiv regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow has asked the U.N. Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
The Russian Investigative Committee released a statement on April 4 announcing an "investigation" into the "spreading" of "knowingly false information" by Ukraine about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on April 3 accused Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their soldiers had done.
I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are implemented, said Zelensky in his video address, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For the shots in the head," he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of their troops in Ukraine.
When you find people with their hands tied behind their backs and their heads cut off, I don't understand," he said of the scenes of the victims strewn in the streets of Buky, a town of some 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, a reporter for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty saw bodies, apparently of civilians, in the streets of a small town.
Only in one place the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies in the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in different locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian clothes - were scattered near the site, which local residents said was used by Russian forces as a base.
It appears the victims were killed at close range.
Overall, the Ukrainian authorities have stated that the bodies of at least 410 peaceful civilians have been found in the region of Kyiv, which was controlled by Russian troops up until last week.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
They were told: Kyiv does not exist. How the occupiers covertly deported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
There is one more point in the list which at the moment has much less information ‚Äì the deportation of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
Starting from mid-March, the Russian occupants have been "evacuating" the inhabitants of the occupied localities to their own territory and the territory of Belarus, which has been effectively turned into a Russian military polygon by the self-proclaimed president Lukashenko.
‚ÄúUkrainian Truth‚Äù found the deported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the evacuation takes place and whether there is a way to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to the voluntary-forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.
However, according to the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were forcibly deported to Russia and Belarus.
In Melitopol the Russians abducted the staff of the second maternity hospital, and took away the children without their parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the late Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zhabotinsky.
The Olexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander himself received a job at the "Antonov" airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled in the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As true scouts, Denis and Marina gathered alarming bags, but on the morning of the 24th they did not have time to evacuate.
They had no car of their own, and the suburban buses didn't take anybody.
Around noon on February 24th, they saw V-shaped helicopters, followed by the first missiles.
One of them hit the neighboring house.
The family then descended into the basement and remained there for three long weeks, until March 17, when Russian troops escorted them to Belarus.
A total of about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
On the evening of the 24th, people came into the yard who were speaking and not in Russian or Ukrainian.
They ask: "Is there anyone?" - I say there is. - "Come out!"
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there was a gun.
All the men were asked if they served in the army.
Women were told: "We have come to protect you on the orders of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was a Chechen OMON, even not a real army, young boys, 25-35 years old.
They said: "We helped the Ukrainians in the war, Sashko Bilyi (the commander of the UNA-UNSO "Viking" battalion, which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war ‚Äì UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day they asked what we lacked.
We said that the water was a big problem.
They broke into the shop, stole the goods and brought us six bottles.
There is a video on the Internet, where children thank Kadyrov for food.
And this is what they brought back from the looted shop: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need the video for Ramzan Kadyrov."
Nobody wanted to say anything, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child is there and says: "You've got seven days to give us our phones back" - they laughed.
They constantly distinguished themselves from the Russians.
They said it was a good thing they had come, because they did not want the war, and supported Ukraine: "Putin is a thug, as is Kadyrov, but we can do nothing, because our families are there."
And in general, they did not fight, but looted shops and warehouses.
They brought a cock, tied a St. George's ribbon to one of its legs, and its own white shirt to the other, and called it a "volunteer".
They arrived in Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their reconnaissance worked... When they were beaten at Bucha, they didn't even take away their dead, they asked us: "Do you have any artillery?"
Moreover, we were standing formation ‚Äì Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to find out, who is friend, who is foe.
They were with us until March 13, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk airborne troops.
They set up 30-40 units of equipment between the houses ‚Äì we constantly fell into it from "Bayraktars".
But they came and told us that the ATO [Anti-Terrorist Operation] HQ no longer exists, but the Azov regiment does, and, according to them, there are 100 such regiments in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been spread since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian - either a naval infantry officer or an FSB representative - came to us and said there would be an evacuation.
We were listening to the radio - they were talking about Bucha, Gostomel, and we thought they might give us the ‚Äògreen corridor‚Äô too.
From the very beginning we passed our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they tell us: "They're taking you to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov".
We are saying that we don't want to go there, or there.
To which they replied: "Pity your children's psyches!"
How it worked: they herded us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - either "Grad" rockets or mortars.
And then it came back... The neighboring houses simply burned down, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit in our house on the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some didn't go, saying that this was for traitors of the motherland - supposedly, "they'll shoot you there, and sell your organs".
We were taken through Chernobyl, and there were burnt-out vehicles and the remains of technology on both sides of the road, though the Belarusians told us that the Russians had immediately taken away the technology.
There are a lot of snipers, concealed equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed an improvised control - many did not have documents because they had burned.
They placed us in the tents of the Red Cross and gave us tea.
And here we can hear shots! A rocket was fired, and we can see the trail ‚Äì it was "Iskander" that was fired at Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, the planes are flying, turning on the border."
But we are aviators, we have an education, we understand that.
Then we got into the bus and were taken to the "Chonki" sanatorium near Gomel.
His boss, Hungarian Vasyl Stepanovych, says: "Well, I'm a clown, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these of your thieves are caught.
Poor people suffer!
And we have Lukashenko!
As he said, so it will be."
They suggested giving interviews to Belarusian journalists, but nobody wanted to.
The sanatorium's administration told us: "And you are traitors already!"
And the people from the Red Cross and the UN (at least that's what they were called) spread disinformation that it was impossible for men to go to Poland.
Many believed and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to go, even though we had a problem with documents - our daughter didn't have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, but the war started on Thursday.
In the Ukrainian consulate they didn't help us at all, while in Minsk, at the station, they said that no-one would take us in the bus without passports.
I will say that Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
They settled us in Minsk and accompanied us.
They didn't keep me in the sanatorium by force.
Our second group‚Äôs migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, and there are no payments here at all.
We found an internal carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
Driving by Mozhyr (approximately 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border ‚Äì Uzhgorod), we saw the launch of ballistic missiles on Ukraine: the missile first launches, beautifully lights up, and then goes out.
People who got on the bus in Mozhaisk say that the Russians are constantly shooting there from polygons.
But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are being released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something of her son's if he was called up.
However, the north of Belarus, where Minsk is, does not believe it at all.
They say: "You lie, we are a peaceful people."
They do not understand that their polygons are used to shoot at Ukraine.
We waited for our friends in Poland who took us to Estonia.
Now we are registering and deciding what to do next.
In Estonia, there are now as many Ukrainian flags as Estonian ones."
Marina lived in the territory of the military town in Gostomel together with the family of her brother ‚Äì his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
She called her nephews early in the morning on the 24th and asked them to gather the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to sleep in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself was not able to return home and will not be able to ‚Äì the house no longer exists.
Nobody knew anything about the evacuation.
And in the center on Monday you won't be able to?
Thank you, we have everything. And we are always waiting for you, our guests!
Thank you for the agreement, the flowers are beautiful.
And in this tiny apartment there's no wifi, mainly because of all your questions, I don't know what to do now? And the children have been doing their homework online since Monday, and there's no internet.
So, I'll be living with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is it a family that is ready to accept us?
It is written in the Quran: "Even a leaf falls from the tree with His knowledge."
Our children study online, I'm a salesperson and a cook, but I can work as a policeman or a cleaner - in other words, I'm a versatile worker. Mariana is a specialist in growing vegetables, she can work at home, and the other Mariana doesn't have any specialism - in other words, a jack-of-all-trades
Is it possible to come to an agreement on how to do this better?
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoly Fedoruk reported a joyful news ‚Äì the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day the occupants were driven out from the whole Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this moment is overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in just one place, Bucha, Russians killed at least 280 peaceful residents.
They were simply shot dead in the street; some had their hands bound and were shot in the back of the head; some were minors.
Among the killed and tortured was found the head of the village of Motyhin, Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in a mass grave, and Igor was in the sewer.
Bodies of several undressed women wrapped in blankets have been found near Kyiv.
The Russians tried to burn them.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners have arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European Truth."
All the equipment, everything they've already sent, for some types of equipment it's too late.
Therefore, when we are talking, for example, about Mariupol, where thousands of people are being killed, and what now?
I see 100 percent support from the leaders of some countries, which is really so.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
When asked whether Ukraine had received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "No, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have been different.
It would have unfolded differently, we would have had the support of our close neighbors, and we could have fought together.
But confident that there were no wars anyway," he added.
We recall that the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armoured vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

When most enterprises do not work.
When there is nothing to earn.

For a whole month we concealed from the mother-in-law information about the war.
For now it works.
However, in Plyamka (the cat is a UPC), hair loss on the back and hind legs may be due to stress, changes in food and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons were eliminated, but unfortunately, the stress does not depend on me.

Thanks to the fact that Olga cannot hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her niece lived in the apartment with her "incognito" for a month.

For 33 days I, as a partisan, lived with her in the apartment.
They were hiding the war and the fact that I was nearby ‚Äì I came as always for a few hours.
But when her friend started talking, I handed her the receiver - she listened for four hours, then two hours of singing."
The radio was always by the bed.
Most of the time the mother-in-law spends in her room.
I could hear her breathing, which allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her walker, I would hide in my room.
First of all, she hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then she called everyone who communicates with her. This is 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything, just not about the war.
I asked my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end

A Briton who fought in the ranks of the Ukrainian army to defend Mariupol says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a serviceman of the Marine brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is defending Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: twitter page of Eidin Aislin, a British man who served in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces since 2018, VVs with reference to family and friends of Aislin, Atlas News with reference to the words of Aislin's friend who talked to him
A literal twitter translation of Esina's words: "We received a message from him: "48 days have passed, we have tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian army.
We have not been left without food and ammunition.
Thank you all. I hope that the war will soon be over."
Details: Eyshlin served in the 36th separate brigade of marines of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which takes part in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists have been speaking to the soldier's mother, Anne Wood, who confirmed he had told her by phone that they were planning to surrender.
A friend of military man Breanan Phillips also confirmed to journalists that in their last telephone conversation, Aisling said they were planning to surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists from the publication Atlas News contacted his friend who said that the Aislin unit intended to surrender to Russian forces to avoid being disarmed and captured by the so-called "Cadet" battalions.
They also spread an audio recording of a telephone conversation in which Eislin allegedly speaks with his American friend who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eslin said they were trying to leave the city in civilian clothes, but it didn't work out.
Previously, the Briton said that representatives of the private military company Wagner had threatened him on Instagram.
Eslam was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but from 2015 to 2017 he went to Syria to fight against terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State".
In 2018 he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
His friends and relatives called him Johnny, but he was better known online under the nickname Cossack Gundi.

The attackers-Bolsheviks got even for their losses in the battle.
They shot at the teacher Dmitry Pavlychko, his unknown acquaintance, and the youth Boris Oleksiyenko.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep pit, which was covered with earth."

Rarely, someone from the village would walk from house to house.
Bodies of people killed by the Bolsheviks were a constant sight on the streets

Very interesting tradition, we also have something like that for Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada passed bill 7176, known as the "Bill on Monitoring Potential Threats to Ukraine's National Security in the Economic Sphere."
It is amazing that in essence the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere has turned out to be... the place where members of the supervisory boards of state companies and state banks hold their meetings.
The initiators of the bill consider that the supervisory board of the state company could somehow resolve the problems of national security in a conditional Kyiv.
We know about a large number of new dangers for state companies, but we do not know of any company that needs to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the address of its location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear - it's a great basis for "sweeping away" all the gains of a difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing direct management.
Such as it was before 2015.
Why do state companies need supervisory boards and who should be on them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill is passed under the guise of patriotism, tomorrow others may be passed as well ‚Äì for example, the system of public procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the National Bank of Ukraine.
A lot of things can be blamed on the war.
By the way, this initiative emerged even before the war and the 7176 bill.
On February 22, this norm was also added to the comparative table of draft law 5397.
And in general, the desire to speed up the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some people elected by the people for a long time.
Not due to criticism as such, but to demonstrate the potential consequences of the bill, let us examine the arguments used to justify its adoption.
Then we will make our proposals on how to manage state enterprises during wartime.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would make remote work impossible for supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk lies in the fact that the supervisory board will not be able to take the necessary decisions, which could paralyze the work of the company.
We agree that such risk exists, but can it prevent members of supervisory boards from moving to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation where the independent members of the supervisory board (who make up the majority of the board), put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be released.
Next, this is likely to lead to a loss of quorum, which is necessary for the supervisory board to pass any decisions.
Instead, it will not be easy to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the necessity to hold a contest, which, on average, lasts for 3-4 months.
Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the proposed bill 7176 will be able to prevent the supervisory board from losing its ability to take decisions, but, on the contrary, will lead to this!
People's Deputy, the author of the bill, Dmitry Natalukha, provides other arguments to support it.
In particular, he notes: "Many companies, including the defence industrial complex (OPI), now need to be relocated" and therefore "it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information via Zoom from Vienna".
To start with, practically there are no state-owned enterprises of the military-industrial complex in Ukraine at all that have supervisory boards.
The supervisory board exists only in Ukroboronprom, which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the OPK.
However, even in Ukroboronprom, according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a voluntary basis.
The entire authority in the "Ukroboronprom" belongs to the general director, who, incidentally, will take a decision on the necessity of relocating either this or that enterprise of the military-industrial complex, which is part of the holding.
In addition, such an argument does not withstand criticism because bill 7176 does not introduce any changes at all to the legislation that regulates the activities of state enterprises in the Oil and Gas Industry.
Pan Dmytro also cites emotional arguments on his Facebook page.
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the effectiveness of state companies and state banks, but let's try to unravel some of them: "Respectable foreign experts, at the first mention of the word "war" in 2021, leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain members of the supervisory boards of state enterprises in Ukraine with a full salary of several tens of thousands of hryvnias, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from the war."
Firstly, this is manipulation ‚Äì most of these members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only come here periodically.
Therefore, to say that they "leave Ukraine" is, to put it mildly, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been widespread in global practice, in absolutely different spheres: business, education, medicine, etc.
It is also worth remembering that membership of the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have another job and the means of electronic communication helps them in this.
Third, all these statements read as claims against only foreigners.
It is interesting why Mr. Dmitry does not express similar claims against members of supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
Because they do not know where their companies are located either.
To put it mildly, this is far from the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and war ‚Äì this is just a new convenient pretext.

Strengthened curfew will be introduced in Brovary, Vyshgorod and Bucha districts of the Kyiv region for two days.
Pavlyuk's direct quote: "In populated areas of the Brovary, Vyshgorod and Bucha districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by Ukrainian forces, the curfew is strengthened!
These restrictions will be in place from 9 p.m. on April 2 to 6 a.m. on April 5."
Details: According to the head of the oblast VA, at this time it is absolutely forbidden to be on the streets of populated areas and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents are allowed to go outside only during an alarm, to take shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced to remove the consequences of Russian aggression ‚Äì to cleanse and demine the territories.
Omelianuk called on people who have left these areas to stay away from returning home for now.
On the rest of the territory of Kyiv region the curfew will last daily from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.

After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the Western countries have completely seriously accepted the forecast of a possible deterioration in the Balkans.

Law enforcement officers of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians, aged 27 and 28, who were involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signaling system near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
The source: "Radio Liberty", human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, who is quoted by the state information agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that three residents of Bobruisk were detained in the night of March 30 with the support of special forces "SOBR", one of them was wounded.
According to Viasna, when detained, the men resisted and attempted to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is now in a medical facility.
The other was given medical aid at the scene.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, stated that "acts of terrorism on the railways of Belarus will be harshly stopped" by the use of weapons.
On April 6 it became known that on March 30 the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of "B≈ΩD" and the administrator of thematic resources of "B≈ΩD" in "V Kontakte" and "Odnoklassniki" Valentin Samasjuk.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, @belzhd_live reports.
At the end of March, not less than 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus on charges of sabotage.
Recall that the formation of the BYpol, which was declared an extremist organization by the regime of Lukashenko, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out diversions on objects of railway transport and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the "Peramog" plan.
In this way, the "railway partisans" of Belarus are trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
It is known that through Belarus, Russia is transferring troops to fight in Ukraine.

The US bans investment in Russia and introduces sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, has introduced new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the largest banks in Russia - Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investment in Russia.
This is reported on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia owned by the government, while Alfa Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets that relate to the US financial system and ban US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the US will introduce a full ban on new investment in Russia.
To this end, US President Joe Biden has signed a new decree that includes a ban on new investment in Russia by US citizens, regardless of their location.
This step is based on the decision made by more than 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The release of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers, such as legal and consulting firms," the White House said in a statement.
The third step of new sanctions from the USA were restrictions against large Russian state enterprises in the critical sphere.
This would prohibit US citizens from conducting operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the United States.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day on Thursday.
And finally, the last part of the package is freezing the assets of Putin's adult children, his wife and daughter, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including ex-president and prime minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and prime minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all their assets in the United States.
You will be able to drive only up to this place, further driving is closed and I will come to you
Vera, can we wash the dishes in the machine?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant for SkyUp, my mother is a seamstress of industrial products, my nephew Makar went to a kindergarten.
We lived well, and did not even think that we would have to hide, because there was no strength left to hide in the basement.
I was lucky and I found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
Therefore, we hope that at first someone will take us in. We may even pay for a room or apartment, but if it's at our expense.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We do not have harmful habits.
We will be grateful for such assistance in such a complicated for us time.
After lunch, I had one lecture in English and then went to work in the kindergarten.
I explained to her there how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understands everything and does it well.
I also met with Ms. Lena, who talked to me about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought the announcement from the pool.
This is a free swim.
You can call the school, Kira doesn't pick up the phone, doesn't answer, I don't know if she reached the school
They isolate the Russian office: stop investments and stop supplies.
But we did not understand each other.
The military did not take root in our home.
Our house is located near a military unit and an oil depot
He just helped me because I couldn't do it on my own.
I'll cook it tastily, not ask for anything unnecessary and give good advice
I give myself advice.
It's a little hard for me, but I understand that I need to go through this stage.
We'll meet on Thursday and I'll tell you everything.
Everything is fine.
How often do you clean?
I clean every week.
Unfortunately, I don't have a program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I dreamed of being a teacher
My girls can't move anywhere now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you, if you hear anything about the apartment, will you let me know?
I would be happy to rent a flat with a decent girl.
If you know, tell me.
On the other hand - no way.
Thank you in advance.
I haven't written to you for 54 years, Natalia. Please write down the exact address and how much the courses cost.
I think it would be better for you to make copies of our passports because they have all the information.
I did not change my last name, it has been the same since birth :)
Good day, Mr. Rearde! I'm sorry, I didn't see you. I'll do it right now and send it to you at once.
We are going to the medical commission now
That is, Ani has to work this hour in another day.
On which day is it better for her to come earlier? (May be on which day there is a little more work?)
I'll listen tomorrow, the Internet is working poorly. Goodbye.
What will you do?
Thank you ... we found some things, but there was nothing from the technical equipment ...
Both beginners, besides the alphabet, know nothing
Nothing happens.
Is it possible on Monday 25.04.?
You can take your children with you, and there are enough toys here :)
She guessed the father
I'm either very naive or very much in love, but I'm doing something with this money.
We'll do it somehow.
But how it will be paid for, please don't offer any credits.
Write me directly, and I will help.
We are your partner, or I am not your partner.
I don't even know.
What should one take with them?
Not my day today. The blinds in the living room broke. In the morning. Another one in the evening.
Something from you came, I don't see it
I am also very sad
I'll remind you about the texture later
Is it only your dad who speaks and understands Russian?
On which day does your colleague want to clean the house and how many windows does the house have?
I am ashamed to distract you from your affairs.
Good evening, I can't not share with you. News from Mariupol about the son - alive and well.
Raju is reading Joe Dispenza; he scientifically studies the impact of external factors and the formation of new neural connections.
The journalist of the "1+1" TV channel Natalia Nagornaya published a video record, which was transmitted to her by the military of the 36th brigade of marines from Mariupol, in the morning of April 12.
In it, the military say they have no weapons to fight with and a mountain of wounded.
They said that "the bill is by the hour."
Prior to this, on April 11, the 36th separate brigade of marines, which is defending Mariupol, addressed the Ukrainians in Russian.
According to the statement, April 11 may be the last fight for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command has not been in contact with the fighters for two weeks.
Skepticism was expressed on social media that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valeriy Zaluzhny, assured that the connection between the command and the forces of defense in Mariupol exists, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the "AZOVSTAL" factory in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupants dropped an unknown toxic substance on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of AZOV, Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons against the "AZOVSTAL" factory, which is held by the "AZOV" battalion.
Thank you, I will adjust to you. This would be very good.
The situation remains the same for now
2 hours of driving )) walks, mom to the stores and back)!
This is not an important matter
She forgot what she was going to do
The Czechüá®üáø drone squadron has begun flights over Ukraineüá∫üá¶ from today.
Almost 50 professional helicoptersüöÅ will be used to detect and some of them - to destroy the enemy on the spot.
Two Carpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" sent to Ukraine yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo city council Vladimir Labutenk.
Today, their inter-mountain friends, headed by the leader of the village council and the coordinator of the page https://www.facebook.com/example.here.101 Vasyl Shchur, delivered the drones to their destination: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian army in different cities, where the fighting continues.
We will keep the location of the drones a secret in order to use them as effectively and safely as possible.
Four friends who are helping the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic say that in the nearest days they plan to send many more interesting "gifts" which will help destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I'm not worried, everything is fine. I love sweets, but I can do without them
I'm worried that we won't make it. A lot of luggage.
I will return to Ukraine soon and continue to work.
OK. If everything is okay, I agree
I'll do my best, but if there are problems, I'll write to you, if possible?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in the house of the elderly in the village of Yivov, she saw me and that I was pregnant, but said that there was no housing
Maybe she will be glad and her mood will rise.
They repaired my phone today.
And I think that today I even froze on the street.
Drank the pills and tea, feel worse, but not critically.
I'm also sorry, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, send me music that you like.
I'm curious about your musical achievements üòä
mom and dad need to listen
You will find it somewhere near the pram of your little brother.
It was cooler here today and it rained. It will be warmer tomorrow.
But it's not the destroyed houses that are the real loss, it's the people who have been mistreated by the occupants
In Herson, the occupants made fun of the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial in Herson on Peremoha Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, smashed panels with photographs of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupants tore down the portraits of the Heavenly Hundred heroes and the killed participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They took down the flag.
Good morning, thank you for the carol, we don't have this tradition so we didn't know, we only gave the children chocolate and biscuits, maybe they needed something else
Let's talk about it, if so.
But I live in a hostel There will be people here until twelve, and then they go to work
Hello a bit better.
He was in the stables today.
He even slept there today.
Therefore, we have made great progress.
I will definitely bring vareniki to you another time!
Today I don't have the strength to do them.
Since I am pushing away from the days and times when there is work to be done on cleaning the apartment after the guests, I can roughly say that in April, as I already have an approximate cleaning schedule.
In May - I can say at the end of April or the beginning of May.
I just asked if anyone was talking about it.
Hello, excuse me, that I didn't write for a long time. I was preparing dinner and fell asleep a little.
If you don't mind, I could come today?)
or we can meet after your arrival)
He is modest with us, and has been learning a lot recently. He realized that this is really important for him
Hello) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to be working with people at such a high level.
Today we had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the department of economy of the region.
She was very satisfied with my work.
Gryshko behaved himself well.
I must bring confirmation of employment as well as cash payment for the cot on Monday.
I work from Friday.
I don't do anything, I just eat a lot and sleep üòÇ (and drink a lot of water üíß)
If you go to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you if possible
I will bring another analysis
I won't have to go again.
The rain gutter doesn't work well, and doesn't drain well. A master is needed. It needs to be fixed.
There is enough of everything there
Could you please send me the correct e-mail address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course that you signed up for.
And should you take your children with you?
And now there is one question for you
If you still need help, write
If I am not mistaken, you are celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn't want to have a fundraiser in the first place, because we didn't want people to think we were profiting from this!
But for online filing, I lacked two points:
I will lie down to rest. To gather strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Goodbye.
üòÑüòç It's a great idea. I'll watch the video now. It will be good because the whole family will be drawing.
Karazin University calls on employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Only rely on official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, also helps the army.
Gathered several works for the portfolio.
After the holidays - the Internet.
I would like to be your reserve designer.
As for me, a day when I was not at work is a holiday
Setting up the headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transdniestrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state."
Literally: "It is not ruled out that the armed forces of the Russian Federation will carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Pridnestrovian region of the Republic of Moldova with the aim of accusing Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an attacking grouping of forces for actions on the Slobodian direction.
It is likely that the occupants will try to renew their advance in the nearest days.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personnel, weapons and equipment for participation in combat operations on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being prepared in the permanent deployment point of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that the aforementioned weapons will be transferred to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region.
Also, for the restoration of losses in the personnel of the subunits of the battalion tactical group of the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Zabaykalsky Krai), 29th Army of the Eastern Military District, a call-up of servicemen from the brigade is carried out.
The enemy feels a particular problem while staffing drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The withdrawal of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is planned for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the opponent will continue to attack transport infrastructure facilities in Ukraine in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the areas of combat operations, with the goal of destroying or putting them out of action.
Determined units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in Brest and Gomel regions.
Individual units from the 6th Army and the Northern Fleet's coastal troops are continuing a partial blockade of the city of Kharkiv and are firing artillery at selected areas of the city.
In the Izium direction, aerial reconnaissance of the terrain continues in order to detect the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
The enemy uses the Orlan-10 drone for this.
The enemy attempted to advance on two battalion tactical groups in the direction of the populated localities of Dovhenke and Mykhailivka, without success, and returned to their previous positions.
On the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of the populated areas of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhnie and Novobakhmutovka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy attempted to carry out a storming operation in the area of the Golden, but did not succeed.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupants are continuing their assault in the areas of the "AZOVSTAL" factory and the sea port.
The enemy used the forces of separate units to carry out artillery strikes on the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the populated localities of Vysokopillia, Trudolubivka and Mar‚Äôyanske.
In the Donetsk and Lugansk regions over the past day, the defenders of Ukraine have repelled four attacks by the enemy, destroyed five tanks, eight units of armoured, six units of motor vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
Didn't understand your thoughts?
We usually try to catch up, but I doubt
And you want to sleep, and I'll hold you
are you not against my coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, so tell me and I'll understand)
Thank you. We haven't watched TV at home and even more so on 1+1. We don't need to be brought up to speed :)
I turn on the TV only to listen to the Czech language
My monthly tariff package ends today :)
Can we do this by phone today?
Buy fabrics for embroidery, canvases, threads for embroidery
I understand, so I can prepare material in this area.
I ask her. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she gives us so many pirogi.
We will meet with my father later, definitely üôèüèª
I read the announcement in Facebook, apparently Google wrote something on its own. I think the phone number is enough.
Good day, we have received the items you brought, but are there any small items that you can bring to us in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If the director lets me, I'll be able to go back to work next week, because tomorrow I need to go to the employment office to submit documents (if they let me, because the queues are huge) and on Saturday it's going to rain.
I'm looking for a brigade at the beginning, I really liked chemistry in school, I'm studying Czech in order to know it perfectly and dream of working for Teva
Old and not very old friends, with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends by spirit and mind.
Now difficult times have come to you as well.
Over the past month I have spoken to many of you.
Your life, which was never easy to begin with, was turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you admitted feelings of guilt and shame for the actions of your country towards your neighbors.
Because of what you are doing to Ukraine in my name.
Some of you, activists, have been under threat for a long time, and you have been preparing for the final blow.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from the "Memorial".
I'll tell you later, - as usual, Sasha replied laconically. - Now, after the search, we're walking around the ruins.
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - have been struck by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, and the majority of you hate them.
But let's be frank: apart from a very few of you - those who worked at "Memorial", "Novaya Gazeta", "Echo of Moscow", "Meduza", Navalny's organisation and a number of other places - how many of you did at least something to oppose this regime?
Apart from participation in rallies, when they were still taking place.
Read also a column by Russian journalist "Late to hide, late to speak"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt - is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are summoned by your longstanding indifference to what is going on around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now, in all likelihood, weigh heavily on your soul and conscience?
It was not always like that.
There was a brief period in the 1990s when you did have freedom and democracy - messy, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was not better than 1917.
Why is it that every time there is a revolution, when it finally happens to you, you are overcome by such a strong fear of chaos that you end up seeking salvation behind the back of the tsar, even if his name is Stalin or Putin?
However many people he killed, you still feel safe near him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and publicizing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Gestapo, you left the soul at the Dzerzhinsky monument - and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew itself, reform itself, and take power in the country.
When you were given a choice between looting the country and bringing back Communists, you didn't fight for the possibility of a third option - and meekly resigned yourselves to looting.
In 1998 your economy collapsed and that marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then came Mr Putin. Young, energetic, aggressive, he promised to crack down on terrorists and revive the economy.
Not many of you bought it, but you all voted for it, or didn't vote at all.
When he started again to level Chechnya with the ground, the majority of you closed your eyes to this.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping those affected by Putin's "anti-terrorist operation", and saw the ruins of Grozny, Katyr-Yurt, Itum-Kali and other cities with my own eyes.
Sometimes, on weekends, I returned to Moscow and had a great time with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the killing of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of their dead to their families.
You said to me: "Bred, we are tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
In response, I was outraged: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
This is your government shelling one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, that was all too hard, too painful, and you didn't want to know.
Then came the economic recovery of the mid-noughties, driven by rising oil prices and Mr Putin's willingness to countenance the fact that some of the stolen money would remain in the pockets of the middle classes.
Many of you are doing well, some are getting rich, and even the poorest of you have bought new homes and found better jobs.
Prices rose, but was it a disaster?
Moscow sparkled and shone with light.
When several opposition figures were killed - Yuriy Shchekochyhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and appalled at what was happening.
However, things did not go further.
When Putin handed over the presidency to Medvedev after two terms, and took the post of prime minister himself, you, as I can see, paid little attention to this.
When, after several months of Medvedev rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you did I meet in the years that followed in the mountains of Gudauta, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we in the West have done little, if anything.
A bit of indignation, a bit of sanctions; but what significance did it have that Russia was crying out in violation of international law when there was such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and internal market?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the hard 1990s, this was the main thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, finally woke up.
When Mr Putin changed places with Mr Medvedev and resumed the presidency, many of you decided that this was too much, and you protested en masse.
The name Navalny became a nickname, you didn't leave the streets for a month, and the regime eventually realized that it was losing its footing.
After that he struck back.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were imprisoned.
Some received huge terms.
What could we do?"
I hear it so often and still hear it.
The state is so strong and we are so weak.
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Take a look at what they did two years ago.
Outraged by a pro-Russian president who had betrayed their European hopes, they seized Maidan - and never let it go.
They set up an encampment and got ready to defend it.
When the police arrived and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, armor and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protesters attacked.
Many were killed, but they won.
The fugitive became Yanukovych, and the Ukrainians returned to themselves democracy, the right to independently elect leaders and remove them if they do a bad job.
Maidan was not to Putin's liking.
It was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he occupied Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but the benefits were small.
And how many of you were in awe!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Where did the new myth suddenly come from, and how many of you, who despised Putin and his clique, suddenly did a 180-degree turn and began to worship him?
It's hard for me to find a reason because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
We are not interested in politics, they say.
And you've hidden in books, movies, catalogues of IKEA and parks, as if you were new after the restoration, which the mayor of Moscow started in 2012, ‚Äì with their bin bags, free Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so nice ‚Äì and becomes only better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
Were there terrorists there, though?
ISIS or something there... Even a Moscow-based editor who published my book on Syria slated it at the time of its release, because I allegedly understood nothing of what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw with my own eyes how snipers from the state security service shot at children of my age in the streets of Homs.
Among all Russian citizens, there were only your soldiers there, who started bombing thousands of peaceful citizens in 2015, acquiring experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
First they came for the socialists, but I was silent - for I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade unionists, but I was silent - for I am not a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Jews, but I didn't say anything because I'm not a Jew.
Then they came after me but there was no-one left who could say anything in my defence."
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did this.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some really are talking now ‚Äì for example, Dmitry Gluhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, risking ending up in a new GULAG or keeping company with Navalny.
As for others, you know best where you live.
Which is why, I am sure, you understand that when Mr Putin has finished with the Ukrainians - or, more likely, if he does not get his way - he will come for you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who are brave, but mostly go to protests alone, and who have been released on minor terms, but will soon face more serious charges.
Out of thousands of you who signed the petition, who expressed their disagreement on social media (even just by using a black square on Instagram), or who expressed themselves in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The days when 10 or even 25 years in jail was just a joke are long gone - and now they are coming back to haunt you in the future.
Who will support you then? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight it.
And what brain, motivation and courage can stop him, however great his advantage on paper.
Virtually no one in Russia is aware of this, nor do they realize that a war is still ongoing.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
If you read foreign news online, have friends or even relatives in Ukraine whom you keep in touch with.
And Putin knows that you know.
So be ready.
You understand where all this is going.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are a joke, your laws are only worth the paper they are written on, you have no remaining free media, your economy is collapsing faster than I can write this, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket out, even if some flights are still available.
Now Putin is not satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try or go away or they'll horsewhip you.
I doubt that you see another option.
But there is still one left.
That will ultimately overthrow this regime.
And, possibly, in the conditions that have developed, you will need less than you think.
Think about this.
The spark will not ignite because of you: because of the economic collapse looming over Russia, it will most likely ignite in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices soar while salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes out on its own, as has already happened periodically, it will be easy for him to suppress them one by one.
It will be necessary to organize and coordinate. It will be necessary to transform the crowd into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool - the internet - that the regime can restrict, but which still works and which can be made to work in almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was dismantled, but it is possible to create other, more informal and more decentralized ones.
You are very many, you are millions.
Moscow police can cope with 30,000 people in the streets of the city, possibly with tens of thousands.
If more than 300,000 come out, she will be shocked.
It will be necessary to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to the matter?
After all that he did to them in Ukraine, after all that he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those with children will fear for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
I would be afraid at your place too.
Using the example of Syria and now Ukraine, Mr Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to disregard their master. Those who dare to demand freedom, but really try to seize it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son makes a joke in an online computer game - and is arrested; your daughter expresses herself indignantly on the internet - and is arrested; your close friend makes a mistake - and dies in a Syrian jail under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years ‚Äì and it will only get worse, taking on ever greater proportions.
So you have no choice. If you don't do anything, you know what it will lead to.
Act coolly, think strategically and achieve that it becomes reality.
We were at a lesson on Friday and we were told we could come in on Monday
We will be at home in the evening
What do you see me as a press secretary?
How often do you go to an expensive restaurant for dinner?
Once in a while I go to an expensive restaurant for dinner
I'll try to explain it to her)
So we liked it very much and we wanted to do something like that, but even better
She was in a room with a lot of people. She was exhausted.
I feel bad, cough, temperature, disappeared voice, weakness and head spinning
I must go to that government work.
We have already done this, but they said that the person who registered in April received the money only at the end of the month.
We need to get a passport on Thursday and go to the doctor with the children.
But one night a lady wrote to me and told me she liked my work and would like something in her house.
I am waiting for new news from her and will definitely inform.
Working as a prosecutor, I thought I was building a career, spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a complicated psychological, responsible, intellectual job in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a shame about the lost time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life I'm communicative, but I'm an only child and I'm serious about marriage.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died of heart problems.
I think that to create a family people should love, respect and trust each other.
I have not met such a person.
Good day. Where in Yegorovka can one purchase forms for baking a bun (paper or silicone)?
OK, thank you for the advice, I will fill in the application form now and enclose a certificate of the currency
She has cerebral palsy and is in a lying position, she now has a broken collarbone in plaster, a pram in the lying-down position, puree being blended
Dear Reykhards, excuse me for disturbing you in your leisure time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natasha's playroom and congratulated her today.
She found herself in an unpleasant situation.
But when the children went home, one mother refused to pick up her child because she said she had come to look at the things and put them away in the room with the clothes and Mr. Valeri yesterday opened our children's room to 19:00.
Is it really so?
The working time of the room is until 16:00.
And, finally, it is our responsibility.
But it doesn't open the page and the internet is very weak
Good day, everything is fine) Kolya works, yesterday we filled out the invitations, and I worked with the elder ones before the exam in the gymnasium.
The most difficult thing is to understand geometry.
On Saturday Vladimir helped us.
Vika studies universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We are very grateful for the house
