Isn't it true that the Destiny Plan of "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny" failed because Durandal was tied up by Taria?

I don't want to watch TV because of that...
Is it too much to ask that celebrities act like decent human beings? It's just a TV show.
Yesterday on Netflix, I watched the thousand birds take flight, but there were a lot of scenes where the staff were laughing shyly at the back.
There's no funny part at all in saying that I'm an artist because I'm selling.
However, if the staff don't smile, the artist's mood is ruined, and the job becomes tasteless.
The entertainment industry was as segregated as black businesses back in the day, and some of the egos of the artists were as inflated as they are now, and it was petty and unbecoming.
On the other hand, the fact that artists themselves are proud of the hardships of their work is also quite common.
I get that it takes a lot of money to get to the point where you're selling, but being an entertainer is a tough job on top of the list.
There is no way to justify the legitimacy of the fact that the beauty of their own careers and the laughter of comedians have been exaggerated in the media and society.
Honestly, I do feel that the industry I belong to is also a little ridiculous, but the more I come into contact with the entertainment industry, the more I feel that it is becoming more and more unreasonable.
Please forgive my foolish words.
I felt uncomfortable in my body because I didn't want to go out...

The goods I ordered at the Tsukumo Net Shop were carelessly exchanged
Summary: If you order a wireless mouse and feel relieved because it is safe, its wired version will be sent to you, and if you hope to return it, you can say
It's not as good as the topic of self-made PCs, but it's still worth reading because of its fame.
The discovery was made after MSI's wireless gaming mouse sold for 3,280 yen (excluding tax) at the Tsukumo Sale of the Tsukumo Shop that started from the previous Golden Week.
Since the wired version was the same price as the store, I also confirmed the page of the wired version because I considered the possibility of a pricing mistake, and it turned out to be 5,071 yen (including tax; Linksoul), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
The order mail came normally, and the next day's departure mail also came.
In these two emails and in the purchase record of my page, the name of "CLUTCH GM41 Lightweight Wireless" was written.
Since there was no mistake in the contact and cancellation until the departure from the order, it was thought that the ordered wireless mouse had arrived at this point.
There was a problem with the delivery from there. I received an e-mail saying that "there was a difference in the registration of the merchandise a few hours after the shipment."
According to the email
It was sold at a discount as a wireless version, but it was actually a wired version.
Since we have already shipped the wired mouse,
1. Refusing to accept the delivery and cancelling all orders
2. Return the mouse alone for a refund
3. Use the wired mouse directly
Choose the corresponding response.
The product pages of the wired and wireless versions are different, and the purchase record is also written in the mail and the warranty card is also written in the wireless version, so it seems to have been carelessly replaced with the wired version.
I was sent the wrong goods without my knowledge and was asked to return them. Is it not too cruel to make me return them from here?
In the end, I would like to ask for your cooperation in receiving the refund.
Don't you think it's hard to get along with a bad person when you've been dating and looking for a partner?

Alone for the second time... The only bridge connecting the region to the rest of the world was washed away by Typhoon Trami and torrential rain. Residents are three times as many emergency foods as usual <v>in Yaizu Town, Fukushima Prefecture</v> (Fukuoka TV) - Yahoo! News
Motegi Toshio, a resident of the highland region of Yaizu Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
It was the 2019 Hokkaido Eastern Japan Earthquake that had a major impact on the 8 people in the third floor.
Motegi Toshimitsu said, "At first it was the feeling of 'this is weird'.
I felt like collapsing or being swept away. The only road connecting the highland area, the "highland upland bridge," was swept away by the tsunami in East Japan, and 30 people in the 11th age bracket among the residents of the region were left alone.
Residents who were stranded by the broken water have continued to carry out their daily lives by using the normally closed JR railway bridge.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "Ordinarily, a car can drive to the front of the house, but since I dropped my car at the workshop on one side of the river, I had to walk over the bridge on foot or on my back to get to the workshop, so I felt the inconvenience of transportation means and cars." The emergency temporary bridge, which was completed in one month later, became solitary again for several days because of the heavy rain that lasted for 3 months.
It has been two years since the disaster, but the reconstruction is still in progress. However, Mr. Matsumoto continues to make efforts to cope with the disaster.
Motegi Toshimitsu said, "I think there are about 10 cases.
To begin with, I thought it would be better to secure something for 2 to 3 days." Canned foods and cup noodles are also foods that can be used for emergency rations and are about three times more available than before the disaster.
Ms. Mogi said, "I don't know whether the disaster will fall on me at any time, so I'm used to prepare for the worst situation. It's better to be safe than sorry." On the other hand, Yaizu Town, which has experienced "unexpected disasters" in which the bridge was washed away.
In order not to forget the lesson, it started its own arrangement from 2021.
Yayoi Ishii, the head teacher of the Education Department and Takahashi Ryu of Gakushuuin, said, "I would like to think about how to prepare for disasters on October 12 every year, which is designated as 'Disaster Prevention Day' in 'Yayoi Town'. An announcement has been made.
I think that the awareness that unexpected things can happen has become higher than ever,"

Attention should be paid when buying a second-hand house!
The loophole of the "building condition survey system" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
Towards the revitalization of the second-hand housing market, a new "building condition survey" system has been established. Second-hand housing transactions are brisk.
The price of building a house and that of a mansion has increased, and the reformed market has a trend of expansion.
On the one hand, with the rise of people's desire for home ownership, words such as "in front of the station," "near the station," and "directly connected to the station" as well as "large-scale" and "tower" have become popular, and the increase in relatively inexpensive new structures has also had an impact.
【View the images of this article】 However, compared with overseas, the existing (used) housing circulation share in Japan is still at a low level.
Therefore, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) revised part of the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Act in 2018, and started the building condition survey, so-called inspection, aiming at the transaction of safe and secure secondhand houses (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/1219900.pdf).
This is a system in which the architect, who is familiar with housing, checks the current condition of the building and the condition of the deterioration of the building, and presents it to the buyer in a report.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained that the introduction of inspections would benefit both buyers and sellers.
The seller was able to avoid the claim for compensation after the sale by having the property inspected before concluding the sale, which made the buyer feel reassured.
This is due to the differentiation of competing substances.
On the other hand, even for the buyer, it is a system that can grasp the state of the old apartment scheduled for purchase and can be purchased at a discounted price. At first glance, it is a system with great benefits.
In the current system, however, the main responsibility for conducting building condition surveys lies with the sellers.
In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the fact that only the notification of the inspection system up to now has become a duty.
In other words, real estate agents who are responsible for mediation, "can introduce architects who make a building condition survey for the purpose of mediation," or "cannot" must explain, but the obligation to implement it is not.
● Inspection of the auction leader leads to concerns over risks On the other hand, when looking overseas, in active markets such as America and England, similar systems are already in place.
In the early stage of the housing purchase, the buyer makes a request for building inspection to the specialists who are called "inspectors" and "building surveyors".
For example, in the case of America, the inspection rate of the secondary housing transaction is 70 to 90% in the state.
In terms of the fact that the "buyer" led the inspection, the main Japanese-style inspection of the "seller" is greatly different in nature.
The seller side shows the condition of the building as much as possible, as high as possible, and tries to sell it as soon as possible.
On the other hand, the buyer is considering to live in the house after repairing it based on the result of the survey.
Even if it is the same inspection, the purpose and intentions of both sides are different.
As a result, the following points have been pointed out as risks concerning Japan's system.
The scope of the survey of the inspection of the seller-led type of inspection determined by the country is minimized as much as possible.
Since it is not a detailed survey, there is a risk of overlooking the really important problems ● For the inspection company, the introduction company (broker) that introduces the responsible case is also known as the customer.
There is a possibility that the inspection, which did not report the unfavorable survey results to the seller, was conducted in a perfunctory manner.

Was Ginza an island?
Talking with Silver Bracelet (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
Yeah, this was Hokkaido.
Such evidence ... ... is just a little bit of trivia.
It's interesting and I want to talk to someone about Ginza's bean knowledge.
Go up the Ginza! ?
Entered the golden seat for the first time
As I walked around Ginza, I saw the remains of the history that Ginza had engraved on it, such as the place names that changed with the wind, the mysterious stone monuments, and the numerous social groups.
Walking through Ginza with the woman, I unintentionally stopped in front of a silent store.
Did Ginza used to be a half island?
The name of the bustling shopping district that "○○ Ginza" was born in various places in Japan, "Ginza" in Tokyo's central ward.
In the first place, "Ginza" was the mint where silver coins were minted, and it was moved from the current Shizuoka City to Edo in 1612 (the 17th year of Keicho).
At that time, it was called the "new Yurakucho," but when it moved to Ginza, it became known as the "Ginza."
Incidentally, Ginza was known as a "peninsula" that stuck out into the sea.
Prior to the Edo era, in order to get to Nihonbashi from Edogawa, one had to take a boat to Marunouchi, and the area from Nihonbashi to Ginza was a peninsula called "Edo no Shima" (Peninsula of Edo).
The tip of that peninsula is currently in Ginza.
Tokugawa Ieyasu established the shogunate in Edo, dug the moat around Edo, and advanced the development of the area around Nihonbashi.
Furthermore, Ikegami prepared the town and developed the water transportation to develop the town.
They dug the moat, filled it in, and leveled the ground on which Sensō-ji now stands.
In front of the Tiffany & Co. store in Ginza (2-7 Chuo-ku, Ginza), there is a stone monument indicating the site of Ginza Police Station, so it would be interesting to see which direction catches your attention.
Knowing people, knowing Ginza's "sacred pilgrimage"
In Ginza, the "Ginza Hachimangu Shrine Parade" known as a "sacred pilgrimage that people come to know" is held every year.
Among the 10 or more holy places, the most noticeable is the "Singing Shrine" in front of the "Singing Shrine".
There were not many people who watched the performance from the right side of the stage.
On the one hand, "Longguang Unmovable Treasure" is on the roof of the Ginza Mitsukoshi, and "Ginza Birthplace Treasure" is on the 9th floor of the Ginza Terasu in Ginza.
The "Shinmeiguu Shrine" and the "Azuya Shinmeiguu Shrine", and the "Togawa Shinmeiguu Shrine" are hidden in the back of the road, and are not easily recognizable. The "Togawa Shinmeiguu Shrine", on the other hand, is known because it is a shrine that was respected by Imai Hiroshi, a famous comedian. The "Successful Rice God Shrine" in the Ginza Bldg. 1F entrance is also not open to the public unless it is around the time of the Shrine's festival, which is held around the eight shrines.
Around this shrine, there are spots where people worship Fudomyo-o and Gozu Tennou, but most shrines worship Inari.
The "Innoshima" where foxes welcome you in front of the shrine is in a place where there are many farmers. Since it is beneficial for farmers to have a good harvest of "Gogumo", it is built for them.
As a result, in cities like Kyoto and Edo, which were prosperous cities, it was said that there was a great benefit in trade and commerce, and even in bustling streets and Ginza in Japan, the belief was widespread.

I went to the dental hospital because I felt a throbbing pain in my front teeth since 2 days ago.
The nerve was pulled out, leaving a hole.
I said I wanted to relieve the pain sooner.

POSCO International announced on the 12th that it had concluded a share acquisition contract with Senex Energy, and an investment contract for the acquisition of Senex Energy with Hancock Energy.
At present, the acquisition procedure, such as the resolution of the general meeting of shareholders of Senex Energy and the approval of the local corporation, is pending. The acquisition procedure is scheduled to be completed in March next year.

The pain in the knee, if it persists, might be "osteoarthritis" of the knee! ?
Different treatment methods due to different causes (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editorial department: Lately, my knee has been hurting.
What kind of diseases are possible?
Mr. Maruyama said: The cause of knee pain is various, such as knee osteoarthritis and synovitis.
Nevertheless, the most common disease among Japanese is "arthritis".
Editorial Department: Is it because the joints are deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Originally, the surface of the joint was covered with cartilage, and the role was to cushion the impact, or to make the movement of the joint smooth.
However, osteoporosis and obesity, as well as intense sports, are the causes of the fact that the bone is broken or deformed.
As a result, it causes the deformation and inflammation of the joints.
Editorial Department: Is deforming arthritis limited to the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints of the fingers and toes, the wrist, the neck, the waist, and the ankle.
However, the most common cause is osteoarthritis, also known as degenerative joint disease.
Editorial Department: What kind of structure does the joint have?
Mr. Maruyama: The joint is formed by the connection of two bones.
These two bones are covered by "articular cartilage", and the surrounding of joint is wrapped by "joint capsule".
Editing department: It's a complicated structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: So it is.
The inner layer of the synovial membrane is called the synovial membrane, and it produces synovial fluid.
This synovial fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and condroitin sulfate.
This is because glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate make the movement of the knee joint smooth.
Editorial Department: What kind of symptoms occur when you have a transforming joint disease?
Mr. Maruyama said: The synovial soft tissue has viscosity and elasticity, and it plays a role of buffer between bones.
In other words, it's like a cameo.
However, if this becomes lax or is twisted, it causes the joint to deform, inflammation, and causes pain.
Do you sleep in pajamas?

Crushing excitement ... !
You can actually experience the gambling and games in the "Cai Jin" series. (Real sound) - Yahoo! News
The explosively popular manga "Kaii" centering on a male character.
One of the charms of this work is the ultimate game of life and death.
【Photo】 Just looking at it makes my legs wobbly... The iron skewer challenge!
Therefore, this time, we would like to verify the games that can actually be played, or that are practiced in the enterprise videos in Kaiji.
The pachinko parlor "Nun" which appeared in the anime "Crazy Kaiji" was crowded.
In the original, it was a high rate of 4000 yen for 1 ball that shocked Kaiji.
This "swamp" was equipped with a large number of "immobile objects," "movable objects," and "three-story crops," and the strategy was almost impossible.
However, Kaji used all his tricks, and finally sank the ground with a vinyl-made water tank and put it in the ground, which was quite a lark.
The "swamp" that appeared in Cage is actually a pinball, and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4000 yen for one bowl," and the degree of difficulty has been lowered, but it is possible to taste the mood of Kai.
The implementation on the debtors, who were included in the "Star Side Party" that was held by Kai with a surplus, was the "iron-clad riding" in the "human horse".
While considering not to fall from the thin iron skeleton which is installed on the ground of 10 meters, the debtors advance.
Twelve people took part, and the top two won prizes, but there were only four pieces of iron, and the safety measures were insufficient, so the possibility of death was also high.
This iron bridge crossing has a high degree of danger, but in addition to being developed as a VR game, it is also possible to experience an extremely close experience at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at the main ground of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, "Rakuten Life Park Miyagi".
This Eggleston Bridge has a height of 20 meters (equivalent to 7 floors), and a single arch bridge made of iron is erected at the location. A signboard of "Sky Bridge" and "Victory Arch Bridge" is prepared at the front.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Corea Coala, a smiling entertainer, posted a video on her own YouTube channel, "It's possible to experience the iron bridge in Japan," and it became a hit.
■E Card A card game for 2 players, "E Card".
The emperor's card is 1, the citizen's card is 8, and the slave's card is 1 out of 10. It is played separately on the emperor's side and the slave's side.
This game is very well done, the emperor is very strong against the citizens, the citizens are very strong against slaves, and the slaves are very strong against the emperor.
Kaiji fights Ryugenkawa in accordance with the strict rule that "he will cut off his own ear if he loses."
Kaiji, who seemed to have read the psychological state from the fact that the device, which destroys the eardrum like an iPhone despite the tough battle, sends and transmits the change of the pulse and body temperature, defeated the river by confusing it with an abnormal value.
The E-Card can be purchased from retailers such as Amazon.
On YouTube, the popular YouTuber Hikaru, who played the role of Kai in the movie, and Fukuhara Ryu, who defeated him with an E-Card, have become a hot topic.
Is it possible to taste the atmosphere of Cairo?
No one wants to have an encounter like Kaiji's, but it's also a fact that reading the manga makes you feel a little bit hungry.
You can feel the worldview through the game.
The first step to the New Year, and a kind farewell to the deity of the prefecture's guardian god shrine. A large horse painting at Yakushi Shrine in Yamagata | Yamagata News
In preparation for the New Year, the prefectural guardian god shrine (Yamagata City) had the great picture of the ox of next year's zodiac, "Tora" on display.
Design students from Tohoku University of Art and Design visited the shrine on the 11th and the worship was held in the precincts of the shrine.
The same shrine has been requesting the original painting of the horse from the art students since last year.
This time, a work drawn by Ms. Yui Tsukamoto, a 22-year-old student in the Department of Fine Arts Japanese Painting Course, which was supervised by Professor Ming Meng was selected.
Big Mac is 3.3 meters wide and its height is about 1.8 meters.
Towaya described it as "an image of the cherry blossom pushing its way out of the back gracefully."
It stands still, looking at the flowers of the cherry blossom. "Even in a rapidly changing world, it has the ability to hold on to the beauty of nature," the posture wishes.
Mr. Doi's design is generally depicted on picture postcards.
Gonnegi Yoshinobu, 44, said, "I think it is a help for all people to win difficulties."

Let's think about how to continue living in Tamano Tamano Workshop for high school students in the city: San'yō Shimbun Digital | sandej
What kind of town will Tamao be in 2030?
Student representatives from four universities and colleges in Yamagata City are taking part in a workshop to discuss "Continuing to live in Yamagata" through a contract.
As a part of the research and policy proposal of the intermediate support organization "Yamano SDG Growth Center", we will summarize the voices of young people and propose them to the mayor.
Is it fun at any time? ".
In response to the question of the fascist, the students answered, "When I grow up, I want to be with a lot of people" and "When I play the drum."
The first meeting was held at the Sunrise and Sunset Association on November 13.
Eighteen university students and people in the region talked about "the island where the theme is resolved" in the style of "World Cafe" while moving the "island" where the theme is resolved. They considered "the interesting town", "the town where it is easy to live", and "the town with a sense of life".
Each idea was written on a sticky note and pasted on the modelling paper.
A town with many young people is exciting. "You can't do without trains and buses for the convenience."
There is no common point. Let's talk more.
I thought Yamanaka was unbeatable, but the charm is that he can win with his cycling," said Yamanaka Commercial High School third-year student (18).
Third-year junior high school student (18) Bunya Nakagawa said, "There are few shops and it is inconvenient to get around, but it is good that there are plenty of nature," and talked about the charms of the region, not just the problems.
The second meeting in December was attended by high school students only, and the content of the proposals was summarized.
It will be announced by the mayor and the chief of education next February.
The chairman of the center's board of directors said, "It is important not only to cultivate the hometown love of college students, but also to make them take the initiative to participate in community activities."

A new way to tie a stole (The Nikkei) - Yahoo! News

In fact, it can be seen that the long cloth is cut into thin strips and arranged neatly on one side, which makes the whole piece look like a net.
In the net, its end is tied to the stake.
Therefore, you can tie a knot without connecting both ends.

The documentary of Beatles coming to Disney Plus is so white
It was Peter Jackson who was directing the whole thing, but
It's fresh and lively like a beer with a big body...
I was so nervous just before the dissolution, but it was not as dramatic as I had imagined.
Irritatingly, Paul keeps saying things like, "I know what you're saying, but," or, "Yeah," or, "Whatever," or, "I don't know," or, "Maybe," or, "I don't think so," or, "I'm not sure," or, "In my opinion," or, "I guess," or, "I suppose," or, "I believe," or, "It seems," or, "It appears," or, "It looks like," or, "It is my understanding," or, "It would seem," or, "It would appear," or, "It would seem that," or, "It would appear that," or, "It would seem to be," or, "It would appear to be," or, "It would seem as if," or, "It would appear as if," or, "It would seem to be the case," or, "It would appear to be the case," or, "It would seem that he," or, "It would appear that he," or, "It would seem that she," or, "It would appear that she," or, "It would seem that they," or,
It was such a relief that we didn't end up hating each other or anything like that, like, 'It's ridiculous to work together anyway' - that vibe was gone and there was just this overwhelming sense of, The Beatles must have felt the same way
And everyone can really enjoy the performance in such an atmosphere.
It was a bit embarrassing how we started singing the song from a bit of a phrase, and ended up singing all of it
In particular, the moment when Get Buck is obtained is amazing.
It's a little embarrassing, but a nasal "nya nya nya" kind of song gradually gets stuck in my head and the situation where the song lyrics get recorded is clearly recorded.
It's unbelievable that the process of composition can be seen in such a way.
I'm an only child, so I'm used to being alone, but everyone is so fat that I'm happy just to watch the play
Up to the third episode, there was only one boring episode, but right now, the biggest reason for the disbandment seemed to be the environment around Beatles, which was like
Whatever it was, it started as a joke among the four of us, but how do you pull it off live? That's when the producer and the preachy people would chime in with "Just like Beatles are the best in the world!" and other such nonsense, and it was easy to go along with it
But since the documentary is also interpreted by the supervision, it is not surprising if Peter Jackson felt so...
I thought that the fact that Paul was being repaired by Paul was the reason why there were so many bad scenes.

What is the strength of Guts in "Berserk"?
Will it become a pillar?
No way.
If you don't call your technique before you do it,
I felt a sense of responsibility because I had a true personality.
I'm living on borrowed time a little bit now.
I was working at the company, but I changed jobs because I was so ill. Although it was difficult for me to do the business activities by myself at that time, I thought that I would be able to focus on the business activities required by the customers if I changed jobs. So, I changed my job and it became much easier for me.
I was told that I couldn't do something, but I found something that I could do, or something that I was good at, and that made me happy.
Of course, it is only natural to feel relieved after carefully considering this.
I think that if there is a company's organization or a window for consultation with industrial physicians or consultation, it is better to consult with them once.
It would be good if you can live a little happier from now on.

Large-scale power outages caused by the typhoon in the United States The influence of warmth and strong cold weather (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
The tornado outbreak occurred from the night of the 10th (Friday) to the 11th (Saturday) local time.
At this time, a strong cold front has descended on the record-warm areas, and the state of the atmosphere has become very unstable due to the impact of the cold air, and the cumulonimbus cloud has developed rapidly.
Warm air from the southwest flowed into the south of the United States, and a record high temperature was recorded.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature will be around 30℃ from the 9th (local time) to the 10th (local time).
In such a warm and humid environment, a strong cold front with an air temperature of less than -30℃ at an altitude of 5,500m has moved southward. As a result, a lively front has been formed due to a large temperature difference, and turbulence has developed rapidly in the shape of clouds along the front.
It is believed that the earthquake was followed by a series of aftershocks.
The American South is prone to tornadoes, but they tend to be most frequent in late spring and early summer, and most of the damage occurs during that time.
The number of crimes reported to the police reached 150 in one day in the winter, which was a record high.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it had received reports of more than 400 typhoons and tornadoes just on the 10th day of the month (Friday) local time.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas in the southwestern and northeastern lines from Kentucky to Texas, including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the Enhanced Fujita scale, which indicates the strength of the twister, reached EF3, which is the third strongest level, on a scale of six, and the sudden gust of 70 m/s before and after was observed.
According to the survey in the future, it is possible to be judged as EF4 to EF5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version of Renewal Fujita scale) corresponding to the situation of Japanese buildings such as the state of disaster prevention has been used based on the Renewal Fujita scale.
JEF3, which is equivalent to the American dragon, is likely to occur in Japan. The level of collapse of wooden houses is very high.

The roar of "the biggest in history" is echoing in the live broadcast from underneath (Sports Nippon) - Yahoo! News
With regard to the damage caused by the dragon in the central and western parts of Myanmar and the south, Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Myanmar, said on the 11th (the 12th day of the month in Japan), "One of the biggest dragons in the history of Myanmar".
As reported by CNN and others.
Mr. Biden emphasized that "he would do anything for the federal government."
We still don't know the full extent of the damage, including how many people have been killed.
The number of deaths exceeded 100.
【Photographs】 In Kentuck, which suffered from the tornado, the residents carried home appliances and the like from the damaged house through the house road 30 tornadoes occurred in at least 6 states, including Kentucky, from the night of the 10th to the morning of the 11th.
Damage was also inflicted in 1925 over 219 miles (350km) in Mississippi and elsewhere, but CNN meteorologists estimate this one is about 250 miles (400km) wide and the largest on record.
Many of the affected businesses in the hard-hit town of Paradise, California, had been open for 24 hours straight in preparation for Christmas shopping when the blaze struck.
At that time, 110 people were working there, but the building was destroyed and the shape was lost.
A woman trapped under about 1.5 meters of debris moved helplessly in the darkness. Feeling the weight of the rescuers searching on top of the debris, she sought help through a live broadcast on Facebook from her smartphone.
In addition to the screams of women calling for help, wails and the voices of other women crying while singing the song, "Happy Birthday to You," which is said to have been played to terrorize the victims, were also audible in the publicly aired live broadcast.
Anthony Brown, who lives above the convenience store where he works in Mayfield, had hidden from the dragon in the cellar of his home with his five-year-old son and they were unhurt.
There were many examples of the sound of the train, but it was more like a scary sound like an earthquake."
The police officer of Meifield City Police said, "Search activities will continue until it is no longer necessary.
I don't know how many weeks or months or years it will take."
In Illinois, the warehouse of online retail giant Amazon collapsed, and at least six deaths were confirmed.
The train derailed due to the impact of the collision that the vehicles were separated, or the influence of the vehicle rollover on the highways.
According to the website, about 400,000 people in Tennessee, including 130,000 in Memphis, are without power.
I have few platelets.
So, how do you do it?

What kind of doctor is a gynecologist?
A "specialist physician" is a physician who has completed residency training of 3 to 5 years after graduation from medical school.
They are called "specialized physicians" and "later-phase physicians".
So-called "research doctors" refer to doctors in their first year or two after graduation.

It is an old saying that the mindset towards the star rating system is different.
On the other hand, the foreign countries have claimed that they will decrease the quota from there based on the five stars, while Japan has claimed that it will increase/decrease the quota based on the three stars.
By the time of the reference point, there is already a 2-minute difference between the two stars, and a 4-minute difference between the four stars. The meanings of the two stars are quite different.
If we judge based on the five stars, there are "works that have no flaws" and "works that are the best in every aspect," so if there is such a tendency, it would be a defect in the system that does not suggest the meaning of the stars, but since such a system is now in use, it is better to give three stars (bad review) without wanting to criticize.
Therefore, it is difficult to argue with those who claim the statement of this hand with the two-tiered criticism on Steam.

The water pump is more efficient than the mono, but it consumes at least 500W, so it's ultimately useless.

[Saga food] "Hakobune" "The fish and squid fried in the season in the near sea and the dried squid" Homemade tartar sauce" | Leisure / Culture | Saga News News | Saga News LiVE
The sashimi bowl "The fish and shrimp fry of the season near the sea and homemade tartar sauce"
Colorful rice bowls with a variety of vegetables at "Hakobune," a specialty restaurant that uses vegetables in a variety of ways.
“We wanted it to have a restaurant feel, even in our home,” said Ms. Hoshino, 39, and her husband, Mr. Uemura, 38, who opened it last August.
One of the popular menu items of the oyakodon is "the fish and shrimp fry with homemade tartar sauce caught in the near sea" (1,000 yen).
The fish chooses the good things in the market at times.
“The taste of the ingredients is apparent in the fly, which is as thin as possible,” says Mr. Ishii. The taste of the avocado is direct.
Vegetables and mushrooms that go well with rice, such as shiitake, and four kinds of pickled vegetables are served on the side. A bowl of rice topped with a variety of pickled vegetables and soup is served.
Vegetables are made into pickles at home or purchased at direct-sales stores in the prefecture.
The side dish changes depending on the season, but Mr. Uemura makes his own mustard and mayonnaise, which add color to the plate.
On the one hand, there are dishes like the omelette rolled up like a scroll, which have a "taste that makes you want to eat them again and again" (Ume); on the other hand, there is a wide range of dishes that bring joy to people of all ages.
Popular dishes include the "Hamburg steak made with Wagyu beef" (1,000 yen).
From next year, processed meat that matches wine and other alcoholic beverages such as "Schar Kyuterie Set" will also be released.

There were so many funny things that happened at the airport, so I decided to use them.
I got on it, and it wasn't that bad (not as bad as being drunk).
Speed, of course, is slow.
It is safe. I slowed down when there were people around, and completely stopped in some cases. I thought it was safe because of that, but I learned later that it was dangerous in some places.
The view from all around is painful, but it's good that it is seen, but it's seen as the "devil," and it hurts my heart.
Overall, it is not so bad, but there is still room for improvement.
It is unfortunate that it becomes easier to use if there are less people or if it is contributed to the end.
Specifically, I thought it would be good if I made a dedicated lane, or if I could walk without bothering other people.
However, it was crowded and I thought it would be better if there were fewer people.
Whether it's the future or not, I got a creepy feeling from the vibrations and the pain in my neck caused by the view of the surroundings. It's difficult to find the owner of such a stubborn heart.
I was so embarrassed.

The long way of the family who rooted environmental protection activities in China's surrounding areas (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Kotegawa Yuki: Consultant, Find Asia) China, with its vast land area, is also important in terms of biological diversity. The number of species of mammals is first in the world, and the number of plant species is third in the world.
The autonomous body recognizes the value of biological diversity, and not only does the autonomous body carry out environmental protection, but it also exists in areas that promote the activities of environmental activists.
Xishuangbanna in Yunnan Province, southwest China, is another such place.
Her younger sister, Li Yingze, is now an actress. Sipson is an area that lies on the border between Laos and Myanmar, and the "Thai" people, who share the Thai nationality and the roots with the Lao and Myanmar, live in this area.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through various countries in Southeast Asia, flows.
Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Xishuangbanna's area is only about 0.2% of the total area of China, but about 25% of the species and 20% of the species of wild animals and plants live there.
This time, I met Ms. Li Menghua, who is carrying out environmental protection activities in Siem Reap, and talked about the content of the activities.
■ A German couple started environmental protection activities together - I have been engaged in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
I wonder what kind of thing it was.
Mr Li, Our environmental protection activity "Tian Qiang" began in 2000.
That was my husband Josef Margraf.
Her husband, who is from Germany, came to Kobe to work on a joint scientific project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest region in China and is home to a number of biological diversity.
However, on the other hand, the economic development has been delayed.
Therefore, in order to lay a foundation for industry in the region, large-scale deforestation in the former tropical rainforest has progressed in order to produce rubber that was in short supply in China.
Her husband was sent from Germany to do research on the recovery of natural resources and biological resources.
And I got engaged to the reporter I knew here.
― It seems that Mr. Li did not have any interest in natural conservation before.
Mr. Li I am from Xishuangbanna, but I didn’t know much about the significance of tropical rainforests and their biodiversity.
As a result, she has been promoting the project with her husband.
It is not because her face is perfect that she has big boobs. It is not because of her butt that she has a nice face. I don't get it.

Ora is not what you think it is.

However, isn't it too subtle to say that the color of the other party's clothing is good?

Because it was said in a roundabout way, I couldn't really understand the meaning.
Isn't it great?

【Omron/Personal forgetfulness】The cause of the CTD in the MOD environment became the personal forgetfulness, and it took about a month and a half to determine the cause
Multiple causes of CTD have occurred since the stabilized data before March was not enough to play from GW, and I got a little tired of waiting for a little while during the holidays.
So, why was it not possible to analyze the log with the .Net Script Framework (I would have been able to figure it out in a few minutes)? Part of the error was due to the .dll series and mesh-related errors.
The main CTD timing
It does not leave any footprints in the log of all papyrus and .Net Script Framework, as well as the log of the type of .dll plug-ins that remain the log.
* When an NPC is killed/attacked repeatedly: The console displays "kill" and "Essentials be Gone" is turned on even with the SKSE plug-in/the updated version by powerofthree off to improve it. ※ Is it possible to get wet?
When the camera work of the kill move against an NPC is turned on, it is basically improved by turning OFF the kill move setting by the PC via the .ini file: is there a setting competition between DAR and Nemesis relationships? However, the upper limit of the number of DAR animation is 10,000, which is not reached.
* (Outside the basic house) When a field mobility and a part of magic (e.g. Ice Spike) are launched in the middle of the movement, and when the NPC is hit: The setting of SPID for the application of NPCs in Dirt & Blood v 2.0 will be OFF for 5 continuous trials.
Was it caused by the misconfiguration of additional protectors and body meshes for actors/NPCs? Incidentally, the default settings of SPID in 2.0 have a syntax error, but the result is intended. It is supposed that the perk is applied to NPCs.
At first, I focused on checking whether it was possible to put on wet clothes for positional attacks and on-hit related motions/battle MOD (those using .dll) but it ended up like this.
At least, similar bugs were not reported in English, German, or French.
If there are many people who have the same CTD problem in the Japanese language environment, it is also possible that it will be used as a reference.
Everyone was in high spirits,
Nobody noticed it and his colleagues thought it was a nice family.
When you look around, it is amazing that such a lively person is working so hard.
However, it is likely that he is also nervous.
He himself did not announce his retirement, but it seemed that there was a limit just before his retirement.
My thoughts on the importance of psychiatric visiting nurses - today's visiting nurses have ended
As I have cerebral palsy, I have received a long-term care visit from a caregiver, but I think that I have established a good relationship with the caregiver (a woman) at the care visit station that I am currently using.
I talk about various things every week.
Of course, it can do what is necessary for medication management (such as packaging), but more than anything, it is important that enjoyable communication is made possible for people with mental disorders. I thought about this during my visit to the nursing home today.
Today, it was a discussion about gender or something like that.
There were also questions about her sex drive, why she wanted a divorce and whether it was appropriate for a nurse to be dating the patient.
It's true that I dressed up as a woman.
However, in the case of the visiting nursing station at the psychiatric hospital, it is not possible to deal with the matter because the obedient nursing staff, who used to work at the ward, has been replaced by a part-time nurse, or because the visiting nurses are coming, or because "he is a doctor who does medical care" and so on.
What I use is a small visiting nursing station managed by a social welfare corporation, but I think that the caregiver, who has a mental disorder and is on an equal footing with me, is a really good caregiver.
She is really beautiful.
Those who have made an appointment to see a psychiatrist are also welcome, and those who are considering making an appointment are also welcome.
Visiting nursing is very beneficial for people with mental disorders.
Please take it if the doctor prescribes it.
Then, let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I would have gone along with it no matter what, but here I was able to get out of the contract.
I'm sorry.
I knew it was a fake police officer because it came out in English.
Why do you come out in English?
There are various reasons, but for example...
・It is not known what is expressed in Japanese by the person who made it.
・Inadequacy of language determination
・The setting of the browser is English-preferred
The ranking of the number of times to appear in the lottery of 6 is all odd,
Why do odd numbers come out?
It is not surprising.
There is some kind of pattern.
Repeat it again and again.
It became a telework due to the coronavirus.
But you can't concentrate on work when you're at home.
I'm so sleepy, I'll touch my cell phone immediately.
I couldn't move at all even after drinking coffee.
What kind of effort are you making, everyone?
I won't be concentrating on it at all, I'll just do it casually. I'll laugh.
I feel like crying a little bit.
It's the same with the keyboard.
South Korea's hydrogen technology patent, China's 50% of 1... "Late in the implementation of hydrogen economy load map" (Central News Agency Japanese version) - Yahoo! News
The South Korean government published a hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
The plan was to popularize FCVs to 65,000 units (accumulated) by 2022, and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at JPY 6,000 per kilo (around USD 577).
However, the target of 27% (around 170,000) for fuel cell vehicles based on the November 2011 reference was not met.
The popularization schedule of hydrogen stations for the core infrastructure is also targeted at 38 percent (around 117 locations), and the hydrogen price per kilo is also within 8400 yen of the load map at the time of the announcement.
It was found out that the performance of the government's hydrogen economy load map was significantly lower than the target value.
The All-Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) released the report "Current Situation and Policy Direction of Hydrogen Economy" on the 12th.
According to the report, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry mostly depend on the United States and Japan.
The carbon fibers, a core material of fuel cell vehicles, are supplied by Toray (Japan), the platinum catalyst is supplied by Kyocera (Japan), the membrane is supplied by Dupont (U.S.), Gore (U.S.), and 3M (U.S.).
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries that lead the world's hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) increased by an average of 14% (after 2014) annually.
In terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (from 2014 to 2020), South Korea ranked fifth in the world.
However, the entire industry conveyed that "in fact, six countries account for more than 90% of the world's hydrogen market, and actually, among the competing countries, it is at the bottom."
In terms of the number of patents, China, the United States, EU and Japan come first.
Since China took the first place from the United States in 2017, it has been expanding the gap.
The number of patents registered in 2020 was 1033 in South Korea, surpassing Japan (974) and ranking 4th, but China (4721) with a 22% level was far behind.
The whole industry suggested that "the amount of equipment investment and research and development costs for hydrogen technology should be excluded from the 'National Strategic Technology'".

And in those days, she explored every corner of the 1-year-old woman's body, saying "Even if you do the splits, I won't be satisfied until I've had a good look at every inch of you." So, in the Meiji and Showa periods, there were many more women of marriageable age than there are now.

and the TV program style chirashi. In the midst of the parliamentary reform, the "communication diary" of the parliamentarian is also used: Hokkaido Shimbun Digital Edition
The Town Assembly has implemented unique measures such as creating a strange chirashi to guide the convening of the regular meeting and introducing a "communication notebook" for citizens to evaluate the councilors.
The town council election is a three-term consecutive uncontested election, and the townspeople are concerned about it.
Since the press conference held on the 12th day of the month was well known, 1800 copies of the new work "Chirashi" were distributed by the newspaper on the 9th.

The town council's chirashi, which was distributed to all households on the 9th, was a popular TV program name.

Military aid, including ammunition, has arrived in Ukraine. Troop training has also begun (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) Authorities in Myanmar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that equipment including small arms and ammunition arrived in Ukraine based on the plan for assistance in safety and security, which was approved by President Poroshenko.
Military assistance amounts to a total of $60 million (around JPY 6.8 billion), and the final equipment to be delivered includes four radars that can identify the launch sites of missiles such as cruise missiles at the beginning of the year.
According to a Carbie report officer of the Ministry of Defense of Myanmar, these aids included fatal weapons such as the anti-tank missile "Jabarin".
The military support was aimed at enhancing Ukraine's defense capabilities, such as increasing the number of troops advanced by the Russian army around the border of Ukraine.
Mogi urged caution on the movement of the Russian army and conferred with the member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and Russia has apparently rehearsed responses to the Ukraine invasion.
The president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, was recognized to have been providing weapons assistance when he visited the White House on September 1 this year.
Military support from Japan to Ukraine this year has reached a scale of about $45 million.
Since Russia's annexation of Crimea, the total amount of assistance has exceeded US$250 million.
The Myanmar military also followed the training mission of the Ukrainian army.
Last month, in accordance with the multinational joint training plan of Ukraine support, the state troops of Florida were sent to Ukraine.
According to the statement of the Ministry of National Defense of Myanmar, the Myanmar Special Operations Force in Europe played a significant role in the training and assistance of the Ukrainian special forces.
The number of special forces operating in Ukraine is classified as a secret matter related to the operation.
The president of Belarus had an online conference with the president of Russia on the 7th of this month, but he was caught up in the turmoil in Ukraine.
When the invasion occurs, Myanmar also shows a tough economic sanction.

The pre-birth donation and the donation tax will be "prohibited" and the donation tax will be "rectified" in succession. Attack the former chairman of the Tax Commission of the Liberal Democratic Party, Akira Amari!
The first special issue of "Weekly Diamond" on December 18 is "Talk with your family at the end and the beginning of the year!"
It is a "consecutive operation of vaginal delivery and forceps delivery".
In the midst of discussion on the integration of gift tax and inheritance tax, the large-scale tax reform in 2022, which has been considered, focuses on the revision of the gift tax, but in the near future, the possibility that the lifetime gift, which is the main measure against the gift tax, will be restricted is high.
How will the relevant rules be changed?
Together with the direct appeal to the former chairman of the Tax Committee of the Liberal Democratic Party and the member of the House of Councillors, Masahiko Komura, we will teach you everything from the basic knowledge to the sophisticated tax avoidance techniques during the year.
（Diamond Editing Department, Miyawara Keiichi）
● From the shareholders to the employees in the urban areas, the donations that can be utilized are treated as the "restricted donations" "From the perspective of more integratedly taxing the inheritance tax and donation tax, for the construction of the neutral taxes aiming at the selection of the timing of the asset transfer, it advances the thorough examination."
The turmoil has spread not only to asset owners but also to the middle class since the announcement of the tax reform plan by the party last year.
Simply put, the reason why they say this is to change the rules for successive generations and put an end to the perks of successive taxation, such as "giving money to one's children."
The iron-clad rule of the high-intensity progressive tax system is to "reduce the assets subject to taxation."
The strongest slogan of donation before death is, of course, the fact that the beneficiary has a home in the three major metropolitan areas. It has been widely used for corporate members who have a small amount of succession tax despite the fact that they have a home in the three major metropolitan areas.
Such a discussion on the "integrated taxation of succession tax and donation tax" has emerged.
What is seen in the 22nd tax reform plan, which was published on December 10 and included the most speedy introduction, is "to revise the current concurrent tax system and the annual donation system", and "the non-tax measure of donation tax is a system that does not seek any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family to the extent of the ceiling". "The non-tax measure of the donation tax is a system that continuously seeks improvement from the fact that it is a system that does not seek any tax burden with respect to the transfer of assets within the family within the scope of the ceiling" (abbreviation).
This was stated by the former chairman of the Tax Commission of the Liberal Democratic Party and the former chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga.
It is very important to lose the advantage and disadvantage of the transfer of assets and to make the tax burden the same at any time.
Underneath, (through integration), what kind of problem is coming out, and where the simulation is being done," he said. The fastest correction will be the third chance left for the pre-game donation.
In any case, in the near future, the direction to invalidate the birth allowance as a measure of fiscal consolidation is unavoidable.
So, how will the rules for succession tax and gift tax change concretely?

My True Brother will be broadcast from January 10, 2022 on terrestrial waves. I look forward to it!
The FOD original drama "My True Brother" starring Gouken Yokohama will be broadcast on Fuji TV at night on January 10, 2022.
【Photo】The innocent love story of the heroine Yoshizawa Kana, who was serialized in the weekly manga "BE LOVE" by Shogakukan since 2018, is the original work of the same name as the manga by Morie Satoshi, which was adapted from the original work. It is a sharp pure love story of the man and woman who have overcome the past.
The role of the protagonist, Hiro, is played by Goukawa, and the role of the heroine, Rie, is played by Yamaguchi.
College students met their predecessors, who were working part-time jobs, for the first time.
Hayato, who has been suffering from insomnia, is a curious young man who is able to fall asleep on someone else's shoulder.
Although Rie looks like her brother who has been living apart from their parents since their parents' divorce, is it true that Ali is a killer just because of a certain resemblance?
・Tsuyoshi Kusanagi Comment: The drama "My Brother" will be broadcast on the ground wave from January 10!
For those who couldn't make it to FOD, it would be great if you could see it, and for those who have already seen it, I would like to invite you to take a deeper look at the complex psychological portraits of Salieri and Liszt, as well as the change of two people, etc.
I'm happy that it was enjoyed by the original fans as well.
I look forward to it!

【NFL】The team that won 3 passes in the first test The players wondered how they felt (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this match, Jonh's pass = Peyton's pass was just 3 times.
This is the fewest number of passes with two or fewer interceptions in the NFL in the past 50 years since 1974 when the Bills recorded two passes in a game against the New York Jets in the third week.
In 1974, Bill's had a phenomenal running back in O.J. Simpson, who rushed for 2,000 yards in a season for the first time in history.
Bills was tackled by Simpson and another RB, Brandon Jacobs, on a run.
The biggest reason Peyton put on such an extreme show this time was the weather.
Buffalo is located in a town near the Canada-US border and is almost the same latitude as the northern tip of Hokkaido.
The temperature was about 1 degree Celsius higher than the previous day, and the wind blew at 18m/s. It snowed before the game.
Billz is from the area and did not change his playlist much.
The ratio of passes to runs was 25 to 30.
Arren's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception and it was certainly not a goal.
There were 4 times of Red Zone intrusion in 10 offensive series and it was a good chance to score a point.
In particular, the third quarter final was extended to the red zone three times.
However, they couldn't score more than 3 points in the 3 rounds.
The goal before the final whistle.
The Bills were penalized for 3rd&9 and became 3rd&14.
It was 18 yards to the goal.
On 3rd and 14, QB Aaron was surrounded by the Pittsburgh defense and came out to the right from the pocket.
And he threw away his chance of victory by going for the end zone and being tackled by Tedy Bruschi.
In this play, Essex WR Stewart Digs, who was outside right, had a free in the end zone after cutting through the Charlton defense, but it was not seen by the referee.
4th&18, Aren went after WR Gabriel Davis, who had gotten wide left end, but the pass was broken up by DB Miles Brooks-Blaine in the end zone.
Brian was covering Billy's WR call, Billie, but when he saw Allen's movement, he let go of Billie and reacted to the pass.
Aren, who saw two receivers, passed twice to the end zone.
The pass to the fourth down was made, but it was not easy. It was not necessary to go for the TD on third down.
A first-round knockout in two rounds would be fine.
Since it was only 2 minutes, I thought I could catch up with the 4th place if only I could finish the race.
Comb the tangled hair.

Sooner or later, "when to discard" and "when to replace" long-term kitchen items (Harper's BAZAAR (Harper's BAZAAR)) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
Even if it is exchanged as frequently as possible, it is probably a sponge because it is not often replaced as often as it is recommended.
A 2017 study found that, even if the kitchen sponge was sanitized with UV light every day, it was still teeming with bacteria (still, sanitizing with UV light is recommended).
The German researchers who carried out this study recommend that the sponge should be replaced once a week.
Mana board
The United States Department of Agriculture pointed out that if the scratches or grooves are found, the damaged board should be replaced.
Once, it was difficult to keep the wound clean because bacteria were breeding.
In the case of a husband who is not a big drinker, a tablespoon of the liquid bleach solution, which has been diluted with water to 1 gallon (about 3.8 liters), is frequently used to disinfect the glass.

It is clean water, so it is dried naturally or with a clean paper towel.

Community market and trade are different
Because the community market uses the settlement system of steam
This function allows the user to conduct red transactions and cash transactions with other people, so those who are cheated out of their money without paying will be victims of fraud.
Such a thing cannot happen.
Trade allows users to exchange items or use them as gifts, but it does not have a selling function.
Is there a difference between professional and employment status?
I can't understand why you think it's the same thing.

Even if you think the BIOS is damaged and try to rewrite it with FlashBIOS, it won't work at all.
According to MSI's blog, it ends in 5 minutes, but it doesn't end even after 1 hour.
It is conceivable that the reason is that the old USB memory is converted into an SD card that cannot be used

To be honest, I think Japan is great.
In Japan, for example.
It has nothing to do with the typhoon.
It's better to say it early. "Why do you only call me? / Am I not good enough?" and so on.
Is it because I'm a foreigner? If you say that, it's just too bad.
I don't think I've ever thought of it as a dream.
I lived as a foreigner in the middle of the sea, but the Japanese who went abroad were the kind of people I didn't like. They were the kind of religious people who looked down on others. I didn't care what they said to the locals.
I think it is a kind of cowardice that if you see someone dislikes you, you will try to get along with him by any means.
Even my friends who were Europeans were called by their last names, but I felt a little awkward to call them by their first names in Japanese.
If it's my friends, it's okay.
The yen is supposed to be just a currency, but it is handled in an exceptional way because it is watched so much. So it is better to say it now before it is too late.
Because it's Japan, I have to speak in Japanese.

Even if you don't post a comment, I'll appreciate it if you let me know your thoughts.
However, the number of people using twitter is smaller than that of reddit.
Please follow me on Twitter!
Finally, thank you so much! The subtitle that I made before was collapsed immediately because there were no people, but this time, it continues without being collapsed thanks to all of you.
I will do my best so that it will be easier for you to use the wiki and the rules from now on.
In other words, there was no connection between the snowfall and the typhoon.

I think the viewers will not believe it if such a big lie continues.
Was it a car or a cat I saw?
Please flow into the water!
As for me, I can't speak English well, so I only judged from the translated texts.
The translated text is a little jarring in the context of the article, but the point being made is clear, and the level of difficulty is just right, in my opinion (I'm fine with it as long as it's the only thing I have to do in a day)
The translation at this level in a game made overseas is well visible, and if it is a small company, it is well translated.
It is difficult for those who are not native Japanese speakers to understand the subtle nuances of the Japanese language.
I don't know what level you are seeking, but if you are seeking the level at which Japanese people do not feel discomfort, it is thought that it is good to explore the other side.

The inspection of "Sword of the Dead" is the battle.
The Equivalence Exchange for Effort is a human satire (The Anime "Travelogue" Beginning Memorial) (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
Among the recent shounen manga, "Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle" is conspicuous in that it is "long".
The fact that there is no battle in the morning and evening, and that the readers are not interested in the training edition in which the hero forges himself, has been established.
It was a 2-year training camp when he was separated from his comrades in the same jump comic, ONE PIECE, but it is said that it is better to know from the fact that he was pushed away because he only drew the touch.
Well, the exoticism of walking on the land is one of the attractions of Wanpi. "Staying at the same place and practicing there" is also something that is not compatible with the character.
The protagonist of "Sword of the Stranger," Namiji Lang, knelt on the ground and asked for the life of the brave Fukuoka samurai who helped him with his life. "I won't let you take my life!," he shouted courageously.
The weak have no rights and no choices, so they can only be crushed by the strong ... ... .
Meanwhile, the "trainer" who was introducing the rookies who wanted to join the Sect of the Immortals, Lei Tao Xiaojun, was a hero for his benevolence (an underhand way of explaining his intention).
The first contact between Carina and Lang Ping was, "What should you do when your younger sister eats a person?" and then slapped Lang Ping who was stuck in the answer.
It was just a joke among fans, so I didn't take it seriously.
However, the possibility of being forced to make such judgments is pregnant.
It can be said that it is an initiative to start from the heart.
He took Dosojin, who has not yet been enshrined, to the foot of the mountain, and left him there until dawn.
The mountain is so steep that the air is thin up there, so it's easy to get altitude sickness and die.
Even so, the sharp gaze of the woman, who was made to work by the hands of people, attracted me. I wondered what kind of "correction" the protagonist would make.
Nevertheless, "It's so sudden that you can avoid it all of a sudden. I'm not surprised at all though it's so sudden even if my physical ability is so high!" This is the essence of extermination.
Ordinary people would never be suddenly so powerful as to be able to do anything without any tricks, and it would only be the original potential that can be used as the power and technique to be awakened.
People who make an effort are praised, but there is no praise for those who don't make an effort. The "equivalent exchange of effort" that only praises those who make an effort with groundless superhuman power is a different human-wide sarcastic poem from the people who don't make an effort.

People who work as a part-timer and want to work at another store because they want to work full-time, are they greedy?
No, I don't think so.
In such a case, there is no need for me to say "thank you".
Something like this is nothing more than an attempt to gain more than the minimum wage with the least effort.
Isn't it true now that the nation has become a non-smoking area?

South Korea's Samsung Electronics has established a "DX department" that integrates home appliances and mobile phones, and emphasizes the "user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Samsung Electronics integrated its CE and IM departments as a set department and named it DX (Device eXperience), reflecting this in the reorganization at the end of the year, the company announced on the 12th.
Through various services from mobile to home appliances, the intention to enhance the user experience (Experience) can be read.
Samsung Electronics explained that the DX department, which made a fresh start by integrating the CE and IM departments, consists of VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and network businesses.
Related parties of Samsung Electronics explained that "the name change this time reflects the long-term business structure and future vision as well as the enhancement of global leadership."
Moreover, products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment, of course, reflect the needs of customers through the services and solutions that have optimized the consumer experience.
The strategy of building a foundation of cooperative effects and differentiated products and services based on the emergence of an integrated leader-ship system across the organization was also named.
Samsung Electronics has already been pursuing a strategy to enable users to freely use content and services across devices through the "Multi-device Experience (MDE) Alliance" already.
Is 1500 BCE the same as the era before Christ?
How do you say it in Japanese?
It was 1500 years ago.
BC stands for Before Christ, but is it appropriate to show consideration to people outside the Christian faith? Based on this way of thinking, in recent years the notation of BCE has become more prevalent.
BCE is an abbreviation for Before Common Era (BC).

Aichi: 24 accidents in one day The driver was not ill and it was not paying attention (Television Asahi) - Yahoo! News
It was found that the driver of the trailer, who was arrested and sent to the prosecutor's office after the accident in which 24 vehicles collided in a small town of Omitama, Ibaraki Prefecture, had not been diagnosed with any illness, and it was believed that the accident was caused by some kind of inadvertence.
On the afternoon of the 10th day of the month, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Highway 41 in Xiaomu City, and 12 people were slightly injured.
The police suspected that the 71-year-old man was run over by a trailer driven by Yoshitaka Watanabe (54), who was arrested as he was driving the trailer, and was sent to the prosecutor on the morning of August 12.
The trailer of the suspect in the countryside continued to move forward without breaking after the accident, and the fire department also confirmed that the suspect in the countryside was temporarily unconscious after the accident.
However, according to the investigators, it was found that there was no sign of illness in the suspect Yoshitaka Yamada, and it was believed that some carelessness was the cause.
Police searched the suspect's home and are questioning him to clarify the details of the incident.

Ogino Mashiro X Kinmei Man Review [Comic Volume 4] (Weekly NEWS) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympic Games, which began in the 3rd volume, is completed in this 4th volume!
From the opening to the decisive battle, it is a new arrangement that focuses on only one match!
Volume 4 of "Meat Man" was reviewed by OginumaX★★★★★(5 out of 5). Superhuman professional wrestling has already begun before the match!
This fourth volume is a tight, one-volume telling of the Kin meat man versus Robin mask showdown, but first, it's worth noting that it's not because it's the only one to illustrate the match on the ring.
Starting from the Indo-Pacific Scout Jamboree, such as the relay race and the special scenery of the badge, we have been competing in various ways until now. However, that is not the end.
That sense of impending doom that carries us through the early stages of the century is palpable here, and it's a credit to the tension of the reader's anticipation that it's never in doubt that this is a performance truly calculated.
And then, before the decisive battle, there is just one more mountain we have to climb, which is the third match between Terimura and Ramenman.
Despite the luxury of the pre-match card, what I like is the ramen man in the backstage who shouted at the poster of Tiger Mask before the match, "This is my territory now, Tiger Mask! "
And he tried to choke me.
However, the tenacious Terman, who had not given up, stopped him from taking the sword, glared at him in silence, and made it clear that the scene was over.
Whatever it is, both of them are already defeated, so there is no chance to fight with Kinshiro at this conference.
But there is such a thing as too much meat.
If we can see such a thing, we can't help but be optimistic about the future!
It's just such a thing that when the character stands up, I, as a mangaka, am reminded of such a painful scene!
Such a fight would have been over in a moment, but the name of the scene is the tears of the ramen man after the match.
I won't lose to a meat man just because of my poor physical strength!
That's a celery.
This is already a grand meta-statement about the work itself, isn't it? That up until now, readers may have thought that Goblin Slayer is invincible because he is the protagonist, and has won because he is powerful.
However, by making such a remark to the ramen man, Mr. Yudetama got his comeuppance.
On reading this, the reader would think, "Isn't it true that Tyson, with his actual strength, would knock out Robin?
How do you do it? "
It is conceivable that this invisible development will be materialized, and that the work can be seen in another artist's perspective. However, it is just a piece of cloth tied around the neck of the work-making Mr. Tamago.
This is a great thing.
Without a doubt, one of the big points of this volume.

The power supply of the NAS PC has been cut off🎉🎉
What happened?
1. Open the window to change the air.
At this time, the PC is turned on.
2.) A little while later, when I returned to the room, I noticed that the PC was making a pink rotator sound, so I shut it down immediately.
At this point, it was considered that the movement of the fan was worsened by the low temperature (6℃).
So, I tried to warm the room again.
3.) Does not start.
When you press the power button, the power lamp lights up for a moment, but it stops immediately.
After that, I didn't say anything.
I tried plugging it in again, but it didn't work at all.
4.) When the motherboard and ATX20 pin were connected with 4 pins, it did not turn on after removing other parts.
5. There was a sound like "Bubububububu" from the PSU fans, so it was suspected that the PSU was not the cause.
I tried to find the ATX power supply later.
Probably.

In 2021, the popular emoji ranking (Gizmodo Japan) - Yahoo! News
My most frequently used emoji is the crying face.
I think that pictures are an essential tool for communication for modern people.
Recently, with the spread of messaging apps and chat tools, stickers have been replaced by emoji reactions.

In modern communication, emoji is essential in the soft and cordial atmosphere!
This way, everyone can use emoji.
Looking at the whole picture, the ranking of the most frequently used emoji in 2021 The most frequently used emoji in the world in 2021!
Positive and bright pictures are ranked.
According to Unicode, 92% of the world's Internet population uses emoji.
The first place takes 5% of the total character usage!
The tearful smile emoji at 1st, 3rd, and 5th place are really cute.
Of course, when I'm happy, I'm happy!
At that time, no matter how, it can't be helped... It can't be helped that there are fewer people who abuse themselves when they feel down.
Someone who has never used the top 10 emojis even once is truly rare.
That's what I want to do.
