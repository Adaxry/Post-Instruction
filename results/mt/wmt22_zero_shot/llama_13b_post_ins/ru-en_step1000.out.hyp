In my opinion, the literature programme was formed by ladies of a certain age, based on their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those same Balzac-age spinsters.
And psychology and the torments of Tolstoy's and Turgenev's heroines are not so interesting for adolescents.
Teenagers are generally not interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, it's very interesting.
Maybe the roses were plush to imply a specific variety?
There are roses of such a shade and with such a structure of petals, reminiscent of velvet, as a rule, dark red, brown tones.
And the white roses look different: their petals have a satin or silk sheen.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige mattress 105x195.
The "Micropacket Prestige" model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different levels of firmness on either side: a medium-firm surface made from latex-coated coconut fibre and natural latex, and a moderately soft surface made from natural latex.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of a sleeping person, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model are the breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for breathability, is naturally ventilated like coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate is maintained in the sleeping area.
The warranty period for the mattress is also extended.
The official guarantee from the manufacturer is 5 years, but the actual lifespan of the mattress is longer.
The protection from dust and pollution is provided by a detachable cover made of Jacquard, which is delivered together with the device.
Acquire an orthopedic pillow for your mattress - it is recommended for maintaining the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose – coconut provides anatomical support for the spine, while latex relaxes the muscles.
Include the brain and chase such relatives away!
It's better not to have them at all...

Andrey, they have explained to you that pensioners work in schools, and they will not work in a team.
The teacher of informatics will not be able to help either, as they did not study this, they play games in Windows.
So there's no support at all.
I remember these dinners and guests at my parents' house with horror.
Guests are at the door, and the frying pans are still sizzling on the stove, while the mother, half-asleep, sweeps the floor.
Lord, let me sit at the table without strength.
Then we'll wash up and go home.
A week before the holiday you start hauling products, two days slaughtering, one day cleaning up.
What about the guests?
And a cake is a must.
I've hated holidays and guests ever since.
I even set the table for my family on a minimum wage.
And I bake them treats, just because.
Germany: Fourth vaccination against coronavirus inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with new force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are unlikely to be enough for full protection.
This is what the head of the Association of General Practicioners, Ulrich Weigel, believes.
This was reported by Die Welt on December 11.
We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, the latest in the fall," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigelt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with vaccination against the flu".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination may help in the fight against the spread of the new "Omicron" coronavirus strain.
And the new version is particularly dangerous.
Therefore, the probability of re-infection with "Omikron" is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is confirmed by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, manufacturers BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection from infection with the new "Omicron" variant of the coronavirus.
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that at two doses the vaccine's effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times".
“This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron strain infection,” BioNTech and Pfizer highlighted.
Therefore, a third dose is required.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the president of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Zalzberg, calls for a reduction in the interval between the second and third vaccination.
In addition, as Salzberger believes, accelerated vaccination will affect the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
The experience of Israel is very convincing in this regard, the expert stressed.
Pontoon21 vibrator, Bet-A Vib, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from the company Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created with underwater fishing in mind, rather than just for snagging.
These vibes have a greater, than that of close analogues in size, specific weight, which, undoubtedly, has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper pickguard made of sturdy and elastic plastic, which creates additional vibration colors when playing vertically or horizontally.
As a "winter vibe" when catching in the vertical Bet-A-Vib demonstrates quite aggressive game.
The most noticeable are often simple monotonous animations, that is, the movements of the needle up and down almost without pauses.
When planning to deviate from the vertical axis, the deviation is not very great, which is convenient when fishing in limited space, overgrown with underwater vegetation, seaweed and other obstacles, for which it is possible to snag.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when catching winter cod and large perch, and especially in mid-winter, when a precise and aggressive presentation of the bait is required.
Having reached the extreme point of its trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly unfolds and returns to its original vertical position.
Bet-A-Vib is used just as successfully for winter fishing for lake trout.
You can choose between two modifications: with a noisy capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It was also noted that the Bet-A-Vib game can excite a passive bitch that does not react to even a live bitch.
Bet-A-Vib demonstrates its range and accuracy when catching fish.
This knot is easy to understand and not capricious, it fits well with a lashing and braided rope of any diameter.
For catching perch, pike, ide or bream, in addition to a uniform bait, a "step", sometimes with "twitching" on the bottom, is also effective.
If you catch it in a snag, you can change the point fly to a dropper, which will reduce the chances of snags.
Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most resistant to work and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
It can be used with equal success both on relatively small and on quite deep sections.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young loafers are sitting on the necks of old parents.

In Libya, they declared 7,000 Russian mercenaries
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagner" in Libya.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, by the chairman of the Highest State Council of the Republic, Khalid al-Mishri.
At present, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the "Wagner" private military company in Libya.
They have planes too.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 fighter jets at the Ghardabiya air base (which is also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," Anadolu quoted him as saying.
Haled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" central Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "establishing their man in power" in Central African Republic.
Save presence
According to the publication's interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya."
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the air base and port in Sirte, as well as the air base in Jufra, the publication notes.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where are the mercenaries?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is supposedly operating in nine countries in Africa - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders, and the protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Vagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use mineral and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," the article says.
According to the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed in any law enforcement agencies, nor in the register of legal entities, and its fighters do not appear in the rosters of personnel.
This company is under sanctions of the USA.
Recall that ambassadors of 27 EU countries previously approved sanctions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the decision of the European Council will be approved on December 13.
Situation in Libya
The High State Council of Libya de facto is the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions and dominated by Islamists, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single day of voting for the election of deputies to parliament and the head of state from 24 December at least until February 2022.
There are less than two weeks before the elections, and the chances to hold them on time are rapidly decreasing," the material says.
Against this backdrop, Libya's Supreme Electoral Commission has postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports.
Russia's foreign policy as seen by Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% think that failures predominate.
Examples of successes: "We defended and restored peace in Syria," "Nord Stream-2 solved," "The whole world was scared by our weapons," "Crimea was ours."
The main failures are the "conflict with Ukraine," "confrontation with Western countries," and "isolation from the world," the study of the Foundation "Public Opinion" says.
The government of Dubai has completely refused paperwork - all public services have also become digital
The government of Dubai announced a full refusal from paperwork and transition to digital technologies.
All state services for the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This was reported by the Emirates' news agency WAM.
“Today marks the beginning of a new phase in the digital transformation of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government,” said His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Dubai Executive Council, on Saturday.
From now on, all internal and external document flow in all government institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The initiative concerns all sectors without exception: healthcare, public utilities, police, municipal bodies, courts, and so on. Many commercial structures have also joined the initiative of the government.
The transition to e-government and digitization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, as the authorities figure it, 33.6 million sheets of paper have been saved, which amounts to 1.4 million hours of human labor and $353.8 million in monetary terms.
Previously, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens two days per year.
Well, yes, about dates of birth and how old the child is, it's all nonsense, about the class and the group in the kindergarten too.
I don't believe such things happen.
And if they do, they clearly don't give a damn, including about their family.
My mother lived with her two brothers and grandfather with grandmother on the third floor of Vladimirskaya, 3. It was a one-storey flat without grilles.
They first knocked on the door, then on the window, then decided not to waste time and broke the window and got in, but the grandfather had a baseball bat and they got it.
These people definitely knew that someone was home...
Production and export of cars in Turkey fell below the level of 2020
Automobile production and exports in Turkey plummeted sharply in November amid the devaluation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's indicators were worse than the previous year's result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Association of Automotive Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, 115,000 vehicles were released from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than in the previous year.
Some 75,900 vehicles were exported, which is 25% less than in the same period last year.
And if the automotive sector of Turkey demonstrated positive dynamics in the first 10 months of this year compared to the same period of the previous year, then according to the results of 11 months of 2021, the release of vehicles turned out to be 0.3% worse than the previous year's figure.
The reason for such a fall was a sharp devaluation of the Turkish lira, which in November weakened against the dollar by 29%.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 MSB subjects received a deferral on credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov told about the situation with the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform" reports.
According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on regulation and development of financial market, in the current year in execution of the instruction of the Head of state from April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency from April 9, 2021 No. 127 "On approval of the Order of providing postponement of payments on loans of subjects of small and medium business" was issued, - Alihan Smailov wrote in his answer to the deputy's inquiry.
He reminded that the order on the postponement of repayment of loans provided for the possibility for banks and microfinance organizations to postpone payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021, including individual entrepreneurs, for the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The term of the deferral ranged from 30 to 90 days as chosen by the subject of the MSB.
In the borrower's statement, another term for the deferral of payments could be specified.
During the suspension of proceedings against the borrower, the claimant's work was suspended, notice of the need to repay the overdue debt, as well as the creditor's commission and other payments," the deputy prime minister noted.
In 2021, second-tier banks received 603 applications from borrowers for deferral of payments on loans, of which 553 borrowers were granted deferral for a total of 9.7 billion tenge.
In MFO, applications for postponement were filed by 131 MSB subject, of which postponement was granted to 95 subjects for a total of 105.8 million tenge," Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puryazev suggested that people with a weak immune system can easily carry the "okmion" strain
The doctor assumed that people with a weakened immune system can carry it easier than those with a strong protective reaction of the organism
Pulmonologist Sergei Puzyrev explained why the "okmion" strain of coronavirus may be dangerous.
The reason can be found in the conditions under which the virus emerged.
Scientists believe that "okmion" was born in the body of an infected HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
In other words, it met no resistance from the immune system.
This makes him more aggressive.
Thanks to the lack of an immune response, it became very fast.
Apparently, there were these spike proteins, thorns, maybe more than allowed, their antibodies were not shortened during the mutations - comments the pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor assumed that people with a weakened immune system can carry "okmion" easier than those who have a strong protective reaction of the organism.
It turns out that a strong response from the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-olds die and 60-year-olds cough it off.
The young man's immune response is insane, it's completely inadequate: where he could only threaten with a finger, he beats like a cannon on sparrows, Sergei Puryazev concluded.
The doctor also reminded that coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the worst of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia is bacterial or viral.
If the first case is successfully treated and quickly, in the second case, you can often only buy the symptoms - all hope is on the organism.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the organism - this is fever, weakness, nausea.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, tightness in the throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left side, or abdominal pain, may also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, the vaccination of the growing generation from 12 to 18 years old may begin by the end of the year.
Virologist, head of the MFTI genome engineering laboratory Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from the coronavirus.
Among adolescents who attend school, the number of contacts is maximized.
This is the most socially active layer of the population, like kindergarten children, said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and the head of the genome engineering laboratory at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, to Moscow 24.

Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of Covid
The authors of the work studied the fatty tissue remaining after bariatric surgery and discovered that the fat cells known as adipocytes can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in the fatty tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and demonstrated a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also studied the fatty tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and discovered coronavirus particles in the fatty tissue that surrounded various organs.
It is known that viruses of HIV and flu can hide in fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the immune system.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of this as well.
Biologist explains causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Goloyashkin named the causes of the appearance of dementia and told about the ways of its prevention in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself in the gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, the person has difficulty orientating even in a familiar environment.
Golosheykin noted that dementia is mostly caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders, and vitamin deficiencies.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of such factors as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity" can be played, he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, disruption of the sleep pattern and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first symptoms, experts noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and reduction of abstract thinking level.
There is a discussion that hearing loss can be either an early sign of Alzheimer's disease or one of the risk factors for it, the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the FG AOU VO RNIMU im.
N.I. Pyrogova, head of the Department of Cognitive Disorders at the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnologies, told about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30,000 artifacts illegally removed from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return to Egypt about 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on the TV channel Al-Hayat on Saturday, December 11, by Shaaban Abdel Gawad, the head inspector of the department of recovered antiquities at the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt.
Since 2011, Egypt has been able to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization have been discovered in the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gawad specified that all the smuggled artefacts were registered in the archives.
Currently, the department's employees are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts "track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian websites and social networks.
The chief inspector said that after the return of cultural values, they are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artefacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the collection at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities addressed Interpol with a request to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, which was sold at an auction in London.
The auction house Christie's sold a bust over 3,000 years old for $5.97 million (around 68 million rubles) on July 4.
This caused discontent from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also asserts that the artifact was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the god Amon, has been in a private collection and not put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has actively sought the repatriation of ancient monuments illegally exported from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of contraband antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account, and this is right, because the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent nation (related to the Turks).
If you want to add something, only 42,000 people - so many Tatars (of Kazan) live in Crimea (see the census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this nation consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, the Financial Times writes.
The matter is that in Europe and the USA the Swiss bank does not issue corporate mobile devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, a bank can review information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used for resolving business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank reserves the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that had not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees have switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work-related issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's leadership set a deadline for employees to get acquainted with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life, 1925, was fruitful in terms of creativity, but hard for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego."
He is no longer a member of any literary groupings, he has nothing to do with Imagism, he is himself, but he is known, in demand, sometimes criticised harshly, even bitterly, but the reading public is prepared to carry him on its shoulders.
More than 60 poems were written over the year, many of them true masterpieces, the "Persian Motifs" cycle was completed, the poem "Anna Sneigin" was written, and eight books, including the collection "Russia Soviet", were published.
And the main success - at the end of June, the State Publishing House concluded a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
No contemporary poet was ever granted such an honor as Sergey Aleksandrovich, he was the first!
In addition, this promised very good money - the contract stipulated a monthly salary of 1000 rubles for 20 months (the factory director, for example, received 300 rubles a month, an engineer - 200).
Funds were needed as never before that year.
Esenin married Sofia Tolstoy, the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, and had to arrange his family life, support his sisters Katy and Sasha, and his mother.
It seems that life is being arranged, that there is something to be happy about, but for him everything is predominantly shaded in dark tones, as if his nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (composed in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) had materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I am very and very ill.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Does the wind whistle?
Over the empty and deserted field,
As the forest in September,
Alcohol affects the brain.
Many acquaintances noticed that Yesenin was very weak, looked bad, and was obviously ill.
There are more and more overeating, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason, probably, is not only alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was given to Sergei Alexandrovich, there are no reliable documents left.
Let's take, for example, those from May 1923, when Yeseyen, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American actress Isadora Duncan, was being treated in a clinic in Paris by Professor Petr Gannushkin (two years later, Yeseyen will fall into his hands again, in Moscow).
But there are enough evidences of the poet's drinking bouts, scandals on this account, and visits to the police station - dozens of memoirs.
With the beginning of the 20s, the terrible romance of the poet with the green snake developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin lived for a short time with his friend, the imagist Ivan Starcev.
It's amazing, but Yesenin, despite his decent income, never had his own place in Moscow or St. Petersburg. He would find himself in rented flats, hotels or with acquaintances.
Starcev remembers:
He came only to sleep, and in most cases in an unconscious, drunken state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Yesenin fell on the staircase...
Falling, he scraped his face and cried.
Coming to his senses, he began to cough unceasingly, spraying the entire cloth with blood..."
And even Esenin himself, after his travels around Europe and in the USA (at that time there was a dry law in the States, but Duncan took a decent supply of spirits with her) admitted:
I saw nothing there but taverns and streets...
I've almost reached the end and stopped remembering people...
Well, I did drink, of course...
And I drank because I was lonely."

PROMTEX-ORIENT Duet Latex Econom 100 x 195 mattress
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is a modern interpretation of the budget model in the premium class line.
The basis of the mattress is a block of independent double springs Duet.
Within the big spring is a smaller, softer spring.
This allows for the load to be evenly distributed across the mattress.
The mattress is filled with two types of filler – natural latex and artificial latex.
This is an analog of natural latex, but it is more dense and cheaper.
The flexibility and resilience of this material increases the comfortable effect of the mattress.
Artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it does not absorb moisture and dust.
The mattress is ideal for couples with a large weight difference (up to 30 kg).
Thanks to the "smart" springs, there is no wave effect here, when the light partner skates to the side of the heavy one.
The pleasant, soft to the touch cover is made of practical jacquard Sense.
Natural fabrics do not accumulate static electricity.
It is possible to manufacture this model of mattress in a twisted version (vacuum roll packaging).
His son is almost 16 now, and he doesn't even dream of pulling his leg.
All his energy is directed at choosing what he will do to make a living.
He is much more responsible than I was in my day, or my husband, who had periodic brushes with the law before we married.
The father takes care of his young daughter.
And he loved, as Lermontov wrote, "strange love".
Why did the girl cry at the exam when she had not even failed it?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that this was not a school?
She will have a tail.
So what?
I'll pass it on.
Millions of students know this.
What are we even talking about?
Poland's Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus is using migrants as "weapon" against the EU
Poland's Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus is using migrants as "weapon"
Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski said that President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such "operation" next year.
This was stated by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yabloko, the sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "halted Lukashenko," but he is "actively seeking new ways."
The Polish official also believes that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon "in many parts of the world."
As the kp.ru website wrote, previously the European Union had put into effect the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He contacted 17 physical persons and 11 organizations.
In Europe they declared their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic if the situation in the country does not improve.
In response, Minsk introduced a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to introduce sanctions against Belarus.

Not a feather out of place: when a velvet jacket turns a man into a clown
At world events in 2021, the dominant style was a barathea jacket.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion resolution was Daniel Craig.
He appeared at the premiere of the film "Not the Time to Die" in a velvet mauve jacket and traditional "Bond" bow tie in September.
Prince William followed suit twice, first wearing an inappropriate green tweed jacket to the ceremony of awarding The Earthshot Prize, and then choosing a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety Charity.
A couple of weeks ago the trend caught up with Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to get the seventh "Golden Ball" in a Dolce & Gabbana velvet jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same way.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for silk men's waistcoats in Russia.
According to the service's analysts, who gave the information to Gazeta.Ru, they have become 1.4 times more popular.
The most popular are warm, velvet jackets with padding and draped silhouettes, available in dark-brown, navy-blue, dark-blue and, of course, black.
The average price for such models is between 30,000 and 60,000 rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively shirts - suits with brocade coats they choose less often.
They can be bought not only from online retailers.
There are budget options at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, jackets made of velvet are presented in almost all brands this season - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desired model is the Gucci one, in which the ambassador of the brand Jared Leto came out for the premiere of the film "Gucci House".
Choosing an expensive brand of pyjamas, you can be sure that the barathe is made of silk.
Thanks to a special weaving technology, a dense fabric with a rough outer texture and smooth inner side is obtained.
Budget versions are made from cotton or polyamide, but they do not last as long.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or cut, but appropriateness.
“Barrat requires evening light, so such a tuxedo is ideal if you are going to a party or a formal event,” explains Vakoshin. “It will also do for those cases if the invitation says “Black Tie” or “Creative Black Tie”.
The other important criterion, which allows you to choose a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
“A man in a velvet jacket, above all, needs the correct advanced haircut with plenty of length, – are the opinions of the authors of the Telegram channel about men’s fashion “Krasavchik Brammell”. – Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to secular events, at which a dress code is always indicated.
Ilia Vakhoshin suggests combining a silk waistcoat with such formal items as pinstriped trousers, a one-colored shirt, a silk tie, patent leather loafers with tassels, and cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Krasavchik Bramma" are convinced that it would be inappropriate for a rank-and-file employee to appear at a corporate event in a velvet jacket, but if the conversation is about "a person in charge from among those who are in charge of this event," then "yes," such a thing is in theme.
If an employee is demoted, but the goal is to advance higher in the company's complex hierarchy or to earn financial bonuses, it's better not to wear the velvet jacket.
Management will certainly appreciate the phrase "not for the sake of being in fashion," - say the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural tone, so strained.
And it does not associate with the sweet face of a young girl at all.
If I'm honest, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But with all my heart I wish success in life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well lobbied, i.e. paid for.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has grown.
Traditional energy is also out of sync - gas, oil and coal were cheaper to buy than they are now.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
Penny drops.
And who will be flying then?
As usual - an ordinary buyer.
Does the sheriff care about the problems of the Indians?
Therefore, one should not consider Western politicians fools who "missed" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good salary.
Didn't see a single beautiful person in the pictures in the article.
Just mediocrity in terms of average passengers.
Maybe, if such characters are so confident in their beauty as to decide to show it off to the whole carriage, they are unlikely to be approached, probably.
But only due to mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties" but not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is conscious of his slavery and fights against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave who is unaware of his slavery and spends his life in silent, unconscious, and speechless slavery is simply a slave.
The slave, whose saliva flows when he describes the pleasures of slavery and exults in a kind and good master, is a "n*****."
An immunologist stated that revaccination after 4-5 months will help protect against the "Omicron" coronavirus strain
Vaccination after four to five months may protect against the new "omikron" coronavirus strain.
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kruglov, who called six months after vaccination, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period"
Under the previous stamp, such a term was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure after five months, and people with chronic diseases - after four, - said the expert, calling to carry out revaccination parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kruchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or they have recovered from the illness and been vaccinated, or they have been vaccinated and then recovered, they have ‘hybrid immunity’, that is, lots of antibodies and enough to neutralise the virus,” the expert explained.
The "Big Seven" warned Russia of "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The countries of the "Big Seven" (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France, and Japan) published a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that "the military aggression" of Russia against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be expensive" for Moscow, but concrete measures in the document are not described.
We, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up in Ukraine and its aggressive rhetoric," the statement says.
Ministers then call on Russia "to de-escalate, to use diplomatic channels and to abide by its international commitments on transparency in military activities," which President Biden was talking about during a video call to President Putin on December 7.
We reiterate our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the ministers of foreign affairs of the "Big Seven" also stated.
Any use of force to change the borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response," they warn.
We reiterate our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will be stepping up our cooperation as regards our collective and all-round response," the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, stated that Russia would face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "a united voice of the countries of the "Big Seven," which account for 50% of global GDP, which clearly stated that the invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia."
Pfizer vaccine was 32 times less effective against the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
This was reported by the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in people who received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
We see that in most people there was a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the delta variant," Professor Malik Peiris said.
At the same time, the scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against a severe course of the disease in the event of infection with the coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the influence of the omicron strain.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and increase mortality if no additional measures are taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the delivery of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of former Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition of lethal weapons by Kiev within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times newspaper on December 12, Reznikov reminded readers that in the previous month Germany had vetoed the purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to bring down drones by Ukraine.
It is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to acquire the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with its allies.
In particular, this concerns the USA, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government headed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the issue of lifting the ban on arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany Andrey Melnyk expressed his opinion that Kiev should not wait for the delivery of weapons from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German government explained its refusal to provide weapons by citing the risk of an escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the "occupation of Russia" of part of Ukrainian territory.
Such a "non-logical" position, the diplomat believes, Germany will retain under the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky stated that Kiev is expecting assistance from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine is counting on Germany to be its "partner in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year the co-chairman of the "Green" party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the Republic, where he spoke about selling defensive weapons to Kiev.

G7 warned Russia of responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine
The foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, according to the final statement of the parties.
Participants also noted that they condemn the strengthening of Russian armed forces near the country's borders.
There must be no doubt in Russia that further military aggression against Ukraine would have serious consequences and serious costs," the statement reads, published on the website of the British government.
Ministers of the G7 countries and the supreme representative of the EU noted that "they are united in their condemnation of Russian military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine".
British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss warned of "big consequences" for Russia if it invaded Ukraine in a press conference in Liverpool.
We have clearly stated that there will be significant consequences for any aggression...
G7 wants Russia to refrain from aggression against Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, the foreign ministers of the G7 agreed that in order to resolve the crisis due to the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, it is necessary for the parties to return to the negotiating table.
The talks were about negotiations in the "Normandy format".
The dialogue in the "Normandy format" on Ukraine was also conducted by the North Atlantic Alliance.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova stated that by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries demonstrated "their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes."

Ways to return money stolen through online stores revealed
There are several ways to get your money back after it has been stolen through an online store, and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by experts in information security in a conversation with RBK.
Therefore, to reduce the risk of major losses in the event of the bank card falling into the hands of fraudsters, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or in the bank account, which are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as necessary.
Experts also recommend opening a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen during purchases in stores not using the 3D Secure protection technology, the refund procedure can be started.
Within the rules established by the payment systems, responsibility for unauthorized transactions carried out without using 3D Secure lies with the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service, a representative of Promsvyazbank specified.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert from international payment provider Ecommpay, stressed that the buyer has the right to submit a claim to the bank to dispute the fraudulent operation not later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction may be contested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores return funds to the client themselves, if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, member of the Public Chamber, director of the League of Safe Internet, Yekaterina Mizulina, reported that in 2021 alone, there were 11,000 complaints filed on various fraud cases: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online scammers.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss "Nord Stream-2" and EU legislation
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops on the borders with Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream-2".
Although Scholz stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for years to come, the leaders of both countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that he would call on Scholz to speak out against the “Nord Stream 2” project, which envisages delivering Russian gas to Germany via the Baltic Sea, bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia may use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels to settle this crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the causes of disagreement.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland for violating EU law with judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice".
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its supreme court ruled that national legislation has priority over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not make public commitments to stop the work of the "Nord Stream-2" in the event of an invasion of Russia in Ukraine.
American officials told members of Congress that they reached an understanding with Germany on halting the gas pipeline if Russia intervenes in Ukraine, a senior congressional aide said Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Schulz warned of the consequences if Russia violates the border of Ukraine on Wednesday, and this position was confirmed by representatives of the "Big Seven" on Sunday.
Dmitry, look more carefully.
The view outside is the same, the size of the window hasn't changed.
They removed the wall between the kitchen and the room, so you can see part of the second window.
And in general, those who are not familiar with the initial planning doubt it.
And I know such apartments and see very well how they have been replanned.
Let everything be fine with them.
It's always surprising when they write about means for cleaning seashells, toilets, window sills, drains.
You have them once a year at Easter, don't you, when you have to wash them.
Just don't get polluted.

The project envisages reflecting in the foundation's charter that it is "established for the purpose of assisting literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers."
“What is meant by ‘creating conditions for artistic activity’ is the creation of writer’s residencies based on the transferred property in different regions of Russia, where there would be comfortable conditions for creativity,” explained the Ministry of Culture to our publication.

Doctors warned of the dangers of long-term use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergei Tokarev warned about the danger of uncontrolled use of blood thinners after coronavirus infection COVID-19 and before vaccination against the coronavirus.

A doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood thinners, preventing excessive thrombus formation) based on indications.
She reported that there was now a craze for binge-drinking anti-coagulants, and that people were suffering strokes as a result (bleeding in the brain).
The chief prophylactologist of Ural Federal District, the scientific leader of the Society of Specialists in Preventive Medicine, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in an interview with URA.RU, said that the Russians often use anticoagulants in a disorderly manner, and before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the Internet and start self-treating.
There are such citizens who decide on their own to start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And doctors notice hematoma at a preliminary examination before vaccination.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found the money in the church wall will be paid $20,000
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This is reported in the press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred at Lakewood Church, a large evangelical church where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches a prosperity gospel, promising that faithful Christians will be rewarded with wealth and success.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cooley was renovating one of the church toilets when he discovered thousands of packets of money and cheques under the insulation.
He passed the find to the church and, according to him, did not even get a thank you from Austin.
I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.'
We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
It appears the discovery is linked to a theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then, around $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks stored in the church safe disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, a reward of $25,000 was offered for information on the criminals.
Justin Cole was not eligible for that amount because the term of the award had already expired.
Despite that, the nonprofit Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had earlier given a $5,000 reward and later received another $20,000 from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
Earlier, it was reported that police interviewed Pastor Joel Austin about money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person".
That's why people have such a negative attitude towards her.
And it's not that "she's financially much richer than all the rest," as they write here.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone behaves so brazenly, so provocatively, as this lady.

The first case of human infection with the H5N6 virus was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
In Brazil, citizens are required to present vaccination passports upon entering the country
In Brazil, people are obliged to demand a COVID-19 passport from those entering the country's territory, according to a ruling by Judge Luis Roberto Barroso of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF).
This was reported by CNN Brasil.
The certificate of vaccination exempts citizens who have contraindications for vaccination.
The list of exclusions also includes people who have arrived from countries where the vaccine is not available.
The situation is even more serious if we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for holding New Year's, pre-Carnival and Carnival parties and other events, which implies an increase in the flow of tourists," Barroso noted.
Previously, Brazilian authorities required unvaccinated tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
The scheme of full protection from COVID-19 has been revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altshtein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed a scheme of complete protection from coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by introducing injections and using a nasal vaccine.
With intranasal application, there is a large amount of immunoglobulin A produced. When the vaccine is administered by injection, this does not occur.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot get into the organism.
And inside us after vaccination, there is formed the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you get both vaccines, you’ll have a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But for now, there’s no solution for double vaccination," the medic said.
Sergey Tokarev, the chief prophylactologist of the Ural Federal District and a Doctor of Medical Sciences, in turn, stated that the main advantage of applying nasal vaccination jointly with injection is the possibility to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this should help protect the body as much as possible.
Earlier, Minister of Healthcare of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Guseynov stated that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, such a picture is observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hm...
I talked to the dog (who died long ago) like this - if you're ready to exchange a warm home, food, petting, love and games for a dripping bitch, then go ahead.
But the horse was trained and clever.
I chose my society and went home.
The method, which works in 90% of cases, is shown in the video.
Not taken from the ceiling, trust me.
I stopped many owners from running after their dog, so it wouldn't run away, although they thought it was funny, 200,000 roubles are running away (chuckles), I took it by the hand and led it in the other direction.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose the owner, and not the dog, which ran away somewhere there.
Mass protests against vaccination continue in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed their discontent with restrictive measures and the authorities' plans to make vaccination against COVID-19 mandatory.
Unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros from February next year.
Outraged by the government's healthcare policies, Spaniards held a peaceful demonstration in Madrid.
Some held placards reading "This is a false pandemic," "I will not be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a Covid certificate is obligatory for access to bars, restaurants, sports halls, retirement homes and night-time entertainment venues.
Authorities in a number of regions have decided to introduce sanitary passports amid a rise in the number of coronavirus cases.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action started peacefully, but then turned into clashes with law enforcement officers.
The group of demonstrators started to throw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., and even in Wikipedia there is no single opinion on this matter.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine", probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve this title.
I only agree with Zakharova on one thing: Americans bring only death and plunder to any country they invade.

WHO discovered "omikron" in dozens of countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new coronavirus "omicron" has been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The speed of the spread of the virus was reported by the WHO.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the virus has been identified in 63 countries and in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has only been actively spreading since the end of November.
The WHO also expressed concern about the high rate of spread of the new coronavirus variant.
Experts from the WHO have expressed their concern that the new strain could be as widespread as the "Delta" strain, which is the Indian variant of the coronavirus that is currently leading in absolutely all countries without exception.
Previously, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in Great Britain.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omega" will replace "delta" in the next few months.
The number of sick people in the UK alone will be around 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially there are only a few hundred people infected with the virus in the UK at the moment, with estimates ranging from a few thousand to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "Omicron" strain, and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospital every day.
The British healthcare system will not be able to cope with this.
The situation is exacerbated by the fact that, according to the latest studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "omikron" strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian "Sputnik V" will react to "omegon" - this will be understood in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has only started testing the Russian vaccine on the "omega" strain.
Why do we need to see the stages of aging?

Interesting Blondie, you're right, Internet communication is completely different, it's easy and unconstrained, but in person you can't say anything.
And to see a person live, possibly, it's not what you expected, it didn't grab you - hence the relationship.
When a person meets their match, then the glances change.
And again, Soviet times are called "the time of demons."
Then people believed in God much more honestly than they do now.
And they were brought up practically according to God's laws (love for one's neighbour, don't steal and so on).
What ideology is in fashion today - money at any cost.
I have little faith in Globa’s type of faith (she has none at all), but even if I did, the time of the demons has passed in the 90s...
Our Leningrad, or rather, our communal apartment on Bolshaya Zelenina, still keeps in touch.
Of course, we're not the closest of friends, but we do our best to maintain friendly relations between the generations.
Perhaps this is associated with the fact that there were no out-of-towners in the apartment, the rooms were not rented, and the blockade was not cancelled by anyone.
Unfortunately, we see each other more and more at funerals.
Lara Angelskaya, drop it!
Human infants, especially male, are strong, mobile, energetic, playful, push, shove, wrestle, and fight, just as their little "brothers" do in the wild!
It's only a pity that they're not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, needles, scratches - it's a usual thing, but no buzzing!
For what?
Brother pushed, forces not calculated?
And are you always so clever that you never accidentally hurt anyone, not even yourself?

At least seven people were killed and 175 injured as a result of powerful rainstorms that hit the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia and the neighboring Minas Gerais.
This was reported by TASS, referring to the rescue services.

$135 billion went to applications - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user spending on applications grew worldwide by 25%, and the number of downloads - by 8%.
The most popular in the world were various video services.
Users downloaded the video editor CapCut the most, and spent the most time on YouTube.
And the number of app downloads and user spending in them showed significant growth from January to November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, to 140 billion. Spending on users in applications grew even more significantly, by 25% to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile applications market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy came out of the lockdown and began post-pandemic recovery.
Is such a "return to physical" growth of the economy of applications possible? Not at all," the authors of the report believe.
Leading by the number of downloads is India: it accounts for about 20% of all downloads.
They are followed by the USA (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS gadgets, as before, spent more than users with Android: iOS accounted for 65% of all expenditure on applications.
Among the applications, video editor CapCut took first place in terms of the number of downloads in 2021.
They are followed by two Indian applications: MX TakaTak video service and Meesho e-commerce application.
Telegram is also in the top 10 in terms of the number of downloads.
In general, if judged by the number of downloads, VPN services (two in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services for creating and broadcasting video (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak in the top 10, there are another two such services - Moj and SnackVideo) are popular among users.
"Users spent the most time on applications for live streaming and online streaming," the authors of the report note.
YouTube is in the lead, and the top five in terms of user spending also include video service TikTok, streaming video services Disney+ and HBO Max, and Japanese subscription manga service Piccoma.
The first places by the number of monthly active users are taken by Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok, and the top-5 is closed by the mobile version of Microsoft Office.
In Russia, the leader in terms of the number of downloads per year was the shopping application AliExpress.
These are followed by the Zenly service, which shows the whereabouts of friends, and the same old CapCut.
Also in the top 10 are: online karaoke app StarMaker, online fashion retailer Shein, the Maps for Minecraft PE app, DiDi, the online taxi-hailing service, Pure Tuber, the YouTube client, the "Dixi" retailer's app and the "Sovmobiliya" online store.
One of the main conclusions is that people around the world have adapted to the pandemic by switching to mobile life, which has become one of the main findings.
Those sectors which helped bring people closer together, both virtually and in real life, achieved the greatest success," said Lexi Sidow, head of insights at App Annie, commenting on the report.
The mobile games sector generated revenue of $90 billion in 2021. The leaders in terms of the number of downloads were casual and hyper-casual games, which have little or no storyline, and minimal video content.
The top three most popular games in the world are Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the most popular games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going balls and Phone Case DIY.
Previously, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the key trends, analysts are expecting TikTok’s user base to grow to 1.5 billion, the rise in popularity of financial apps among Generation Z, such as Robinhood, and an increase in the popularity of metagames on mobile.

Russians warned about a new scam
Scammers are coming up with new ways to trick people via video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon's Director of Products Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is hacking.
In this case, fraudsters create fake videos based on real recordings with the participation of the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to precisely reproduce the characteristics of a person's behavior.
Abutalimov added that using the deepfake it is possible to call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video clip with the participation of a copy of a person for distribution with the aim of blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily provoke a bullying, because a skilled manipulator can put people into ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," the expert said.
Leading system architect at Varonis, Alexander Vetokhov, for his part, noted that psychologically, people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to technology using video.
David, I add.
In what I wrote above, I highlighted the fact that I bought all of it in a small town, where the local mentality didn't allow me to wear short skirts and walk in high heels, show socks and suspenders.
This is a province, but there was such a product in the store.

Five actions to avoid sugar diabetes
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and rightly so.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a key role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water positively affects metabolism.
Sweet products raise blood sugar to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the way to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The disease is influenced not only by an incorrect diet, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Specialists recommend adhering to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help to lose weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in the level of sugar.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of pasta.
Dietary fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of satiety, the secretion of gastric juices and the absorption of food.

Doctor Pavlova told about "weekend migraine" in workaholics
Several factors may contribute to worsening self-esteem over the weekend
The reason for the deterioration of self-feeling after workdays is often the "weekend migraine", a well-known doctor-endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior scientific associate of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of the Moscow State University, scientific supervisor of the System Medicine Clinic Zukhra Pavlova told in her telegram-channel.
According to her, those who suffer from this most are workaholics, who come down with headaches, exhaustion and weakness at weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to accumulated fatigue there were a number of objective reasons for the negative reaction of the organism to the change in conditions.
On weekends, our life changes radically.
It's long, we lie on the couch all day, we probably eat more and drink less, the doctor argued. - Because of the lack of coffee, a small breakdown begins.
Because of overeating and lack of water - heaviness and brokenness."
An additional role is played by the late rise.
Thus, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction, which is called jetlag.
It occurs in travellers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in worsening self-esteem, Pavlova recommended to trace what changes the most from week to week.

South African scientists stated low efficiency of Pfizer vaccine against "omikron"
In South Africa, Pfizer's vaccine was said to be ineffective against "omikron"
South African scientists conducted a study and reported low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "omikron") corresponds to (the level of) the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection with symptoms, due to which... there is doubt about the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, - says the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time experts specified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar in everyday products?
Sugar - not the best source of useful nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that a hidden sugar - an ingredient that is similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition and glycemic index - may be indicated by an unfamiliar word in the product name.
The label may contain several dozen names that, in essence, denote sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (sugar obtained from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), maltase (black starch), agave syrup and so on.
These are all simple carbohydrates, which are mono- and disaccharides, and they may be found not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctor's loaves, in bread and so on.
As stated in Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed products, as well as paying attention to labels and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar have different tastes, but no matter how the ingredient is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it remains sugar.
It's not easy to accurately count the amount of sugar because, in addition to the amount of sugar indicated by the producer on the packaging, it is necessary to take into account the fact that vegetables, fruits and etc. contain a certain amount of sugar.
As a result, the total amount of sugar can be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, stated that the import of gas is becoming less important for Germany as the country continues its transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely refuse gas, oil and coal by 2045 and become a climate-neutral country.
This means that in 25 years' time the world will be like this: the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role, he said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to adhere to the position that Ukraine should transport Russian natural gas in the future as well, since at the moment this resource is of great importance for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the USA made a joint statement where support from Berlin for the energy transformation of Ukraine was fixed.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock stated that the certification process of the "Nord Stream - 2" gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, during the coalition negotiations and discussions of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also noted that the pipeline does not "meet the requirements" of the European Union.

Hackers broke into the Twitter account of the Prime Minister of India
Hackers broke into the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Scammers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment means, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
In Modi's office, they asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the prime minister stated that Twitter reacted quickly - access to the account was restored.
The page of the Prime Minister of India has already been hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, most residents of New Caledonia voted during the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results released by local authorities, 3,51% (2,755 people) voted for independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96,49% (75,762) voted against it.
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 800,000 people taking part in the election.
As commented by the France-Presse agency, "the outcome of these elections leaves no room for doubt", since supporters of independence called on voters not to take part in the vote.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, considering that a new outbreak of COVID-19 on the archipelago made it impossible to hold a proper and "honest" pre-election campaign.
As a result, this abstention opened the way to the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and in October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted for independence, and in 2020, 53.3%.
As stated by the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the latest voting and will dispute them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, 12 December, in the Elysée Palace, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, is to speak about the outcome of this referendum.
The theme of the independence of New Caledonia has, in many ways, revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of the territory remaining part of France because it is "the last region of European Union presence in the Pacific."
New Caledonia must necessarily remain French, - repeatedly stated Eric Zemmour.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecresse, who at the end of October published a column in Le Figaro calling on Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron declared in May 2018 that he would not seek a position "because it is not his responsibility."
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castaner, for his part, expressed "a strong desire for the choice of Caledonians to be a choice for France".
Hello, world!
I kissed you a little... a lot of times, still uncomfortable, ashamed.
Thank you for not turning away from my channel.

Turkey tested the world's first drone with a laser weapon
The first laser weapon drone was successfully tested in Turkey.
The drone "Eren" was tested at a distance of 100 to 500 meters, reports "MIR24".
The device is capable of disarming explosive objects at a distance using a laser.
The maximum height of the flight of the innovation is 3,000 meters.
After passing the corresponding tests, the UAV is to be put into service with the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy explosive devices without sappers.
The agency stresses that Turkey is among six countries in the world capable of developing and producing their own drones.

Wall Street Journal readers criticize article on Russia-US relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized a column by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of Russia-US relations.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and allowed a number of insulting statements in the direction of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of his speech, Hartwell called on Western countries "to form a united front against Russia."
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is a fair amount of false information in this article," a reader's comment to RIA Novosti news agency reads like.
Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land.
The US and its NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine," said another.

A magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred in the Kuril Islands region
A magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred near the Kuril Island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The source of the fire was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded a magnitude 7.5 earthquake in Peru, which injured ten people.

Ukraine to start producing new generation of drones
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will start manufacturing ANKA type unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
This was announced on December 11 by Alyosha Arestovich, an advisor to the Ukrainian president's office.
That is, they are capable against air targets, against other drones.
Even against piloted aviation.
They will be equipped with Ukrainian motors and the rest of Turkish avionics: the body and the rest of it," quotes Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA apparatus, Arestovich said that it was a question of a reactive, rather than a piston-engined, UAV.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceeds it "in all characteristics."
The first batch of BPLA should be produced by the factory at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was developed by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles Bayraktar and missile complexes Javelin in the course of military operations combined forces in Donbass.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky announced that the construction of a factory to manufacture modern military drones began in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence signed an agreement on the construction in the Kyiv region of a centre where personnel will be trained, as well as tests and maintenance being carried out on Turkish drones Bayraktar.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum "a big real step forward."
Two lions escaped from a container in the airport
Lions escaped in Singapore's Changi Airport.
This was reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from the container with seven lions, which arrived at one of the aircraft.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were heading.
One of the escaped lions laid down on the roof of the container.
The animals couldn't get away from it because a protective fence was set up nearby.
The confrontation ended after the arrival of employees of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which manages all Singapore's zoos.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizers and plan to deliver them to a quarantine facility.
It was previously reported that a lion escaped from its owner and wandered the streets of Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia.
On the same day the animal voluntarily returned home and people were not injured.
Experts warn of cancer threat from vitamin B9
Research shows that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by Daily Express.
According to experts, there is solid evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less likely to suffer from some types of cancer, including colon cancer.
However, exceeding the required dose, on the contrary, promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Beth Kitchin, a professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who specializes in diet, recommends paying attention to how much folic acid you're getting in a day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer only increases if you significantly depart from this figure in either direction.
Kittichai recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, to always monitor the dosage and to avoid chewing gum with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine named folic acid as a substance that slows aging.
As it contains avocado, among other things, Fine recommended that men over 50 should eat more of the fruit.
In the UK, around 75,000 people may die from the omicron strain by April
British scientists' forecasts show that because of the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus in England in the next five months, 75,000 people may die if restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper, referring to the study of experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists, who are part of the scientific advisory group for emergencies in the British cabinet of ministers, by April 2022, not less than 25,000 deaths will be registered in the country due to the Omikron strain, and around 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the epidemic, hospitals will accept more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Serious measures may be needed to prevent overloading of the NHS, if the omicron strain turns out to be more infectious than the delta strain, and the current vaccines do not protect against infection," said LSHTM mathematician Rosanna Barnard.
Earlier, the UK's Health and Safety Executive said: If the current rate of spread of the omega strain continues, then by the end of the year there will be around 1 million cases of infection in the country.
By the middle of December, the strain of omicron may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, 1,898 cases of infection with the omicron strain of coronavirus have been discovered in the UK, 633 of which have been identified in the last 24 hours.
Meanwhile, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.
I wanted to write some smart commentary, but read until this point:
The "shoo-bee," obtained as a result of the unbelievable suffering of the unfortunate animal and its second job."
And the table collapsed!
So, a "unfortunate animal" is a man, and I thought a shrew!

The demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter in the world
Construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking records worldwide, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and fight climate change.
In the global register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than in the previous year.
In the era of fighting climate change, it's hard to imagine that the number of people wanting and able to spend £50m-plus on a floating fortress won't diminish, the Guardian reports.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there has not been such a frenzy on the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of being infected on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If before, all these people walked to the office and met with partners in business personally, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted via the Internet.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that the yards are now taking orders for new yachts in 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are ready to pay more, just to have their yacht ready at least a year or two earlier.
People just want freedom, and the super-rich can afford it, he says.
In the West, many criticize such behavior among the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, space travel, yachting or flying one's own plane causes irritation in society, since the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and propose new taxes and rules for the super-rich, though they understand that with so much money moving around, this will be extremely difficult to do.
Meanwhile, only the number of superyachts ordered impresses, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1200 ships, 27 have a length of keel above 100 metres.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a yacht, REV Ocean, 183 metres long.
After the launch, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
There is also a "moon pool" on the yacht, as well as a submarine for exploring the depths of the sea.
Helipads on superyachts are now commonplace, as are open-air cinemas, and some even feature a boxing ring, such as on the McGregor yacht. Richard Wilk, professor of economic anthropology at Indiana University, says that in comparison to the total number of carbon emissions, the carbon footprint of the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has symbolic significance if you consider that there are only around 2,000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of superfluous consumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of a typical inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tonnes of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tonnes of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission footprint fell on his yacht Eclipse, which is 162.5 meters long.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give instructions to sail the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not elicit sympathy from other people when they, like Australia's wealthiest woman Gina Rinehart who owns the mines on the continent, lament via YouTube that there is no space for their giant vessels to dock.
It's also hard to understand her appeal to build marinas for yachts up to 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol that leads to the development of colon cancer has been identified
American scientists have determined how many alcoholic drinks per week increase the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by Daily Express.
Experts came to the conclusion that the consumption of four or more portions of alcoholic beverages in a week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
The likelihood of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
In addition, the risk of developing colon cancer is higher in moderate drinkers than in women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of such oncology, noting only certain factors that lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, if not all, lovers of dogs are convinced that these creatures are very clever.
But even they have no idea just how developed their four-legged charges are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how developed the intelligence of animals is.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that a dog can understand up to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' works were published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, they do not understand politics, economics and art, but they often succeed in deceiving their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts say, show the best results in understanding human language, but there is not enough statistical data to draw precise conclusions.
Thus, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and are not inferior in their ability to learn to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine prepared for trade with the US and Russia
The US and Russia will "bargain" on Ukraine's accession to NATO, said analyst Alexander Kozhevnikov in his article for the publication "Glavred".
According to him, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations on the US guarantees regarding Ukraine's non-entry into the North Atlantic Alliance in the nearest future.
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you just say no and report the person who suggested it.
And as far as Ukraine is concerned, it's "trade," the analyst wrote.
Kozhevnikov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine and is striving for dialogue with Kiev.
They prepare secretly, quickly, and immediately switch to offensive operations, rather than waiting for the group to be discovered and forces of resistance to be deployed," he noted.
China stimulates development of railway transport sector
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Transportation and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition, held in Chuzhou, a city in the central Chinese province of Hunan.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical failures, said the company's representative Hu Zhaowen.
The high-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will enhance the reliability and availability of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China's exports of railway transport vehicles have significantly increased, and many countries in Asia and Europe have become witnesses to "China's speed".
In May of this year, the first two-storey, high-speed electric trains developed in China rolled off the production line at CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd for export to Europe.
These trains will operate at a maximum speed of 200 kilometers per hour on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro, developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey, began.
The train will move along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the airport in the city.
The metro line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
China's railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovative competitiveness, said Feng Youshan, head of the Investment and Trade Promotion Department of the Chinese Committee on Promoting International Trade /CCPIT/.
This sector forms the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment on the world market, said Feng Youshan.
After more than 60 years of intense work, China has conducted a number of independent researches and developments and created a leading system of manufacturing equipment for railway transportation with a complete set of supporting facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Youshan, the country ranks first in the level of electrification of railways and in the operational mileage of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Goloyashkin, in an interview with radio Sputnik, listed the early symptoms of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, and a whole range of moderate cognitive impairments, such as an inability to concentrate, plan, and a reduction in abstract thinking.
At present, there is a discussion about the fact that hearing loss can be both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the expert said.
Golosheykin stressed that the causes of dementia may be neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders, and vitamin deficiencies.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the cerebral vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, studying foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with the help of games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logical thinking
“There are recommendations on the use of various BADs, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still discussed in the scientific community,” said Gologoyev.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logical thinking," Gologoyev said.
Earlier, the British charity Alzheimer's Research UK said the disease is affecting more and more people in their 40s.
Doctors named early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign is problems with sight, which makes it difficult for the patient to recognise objects.
Another sign of developing dementia is aphasia - a condition when a person cannot find the right words to say what they want to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the consortium of doctors created by Georgia's ombudsman, told journalists.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination and character changes," said the expert, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psychological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia, - noted Toidze, requiring that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, after prison staff disciplined him, Saakashvili started refusing medical aid.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to cancel the punishment and restore his previous rights.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests were held against the mandatory vaccination certificate for COVID-19, according to the agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action amounted to about 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, Covid passports have become obligatory for going to bars, restaurants, sports halls, retirement homes and night-time entertainment venues.
Many protesters came to the action without masks.
The slogans on their placards accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respecting the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, passports will also be required for entry into entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship, calling vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified since the start of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia also plans to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people.
The government submitted bills on a unified system of QR codes to the State Duma on November 12.
It is planned that Russian citizens will be able to visit mass event venues, cultural institutions, catering establishments and retail outlets upon presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a medical certificate for postponed vaccination.
Such rules will be established for trips by train and plane.

A sharp rise: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country.
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 30 million Chinese citizens to winter sports, which will allow them to gather the 100 billion yuan pledged by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of underdeveloped, remote provinces.
Taivu Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, located not far from the site of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming more and more popular among the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, work is also underway to green the area: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international-level competitions.
In many regions of China, where there are resorts, including in Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long-term perspective is to ensure comfortable and interesting recreation in Chinese resorts so that all newbies become regulars.
However, this is still far away.
Organizing Committee adviser Justin Downs says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
More and more Chinese people come to the slopes every winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the serious changes, it will still take many years to create a ski culture here, Downs believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
The 70-year-old Gao Mankong lives in Chunli, not far from the site of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was launched from Beijing to Chunli, and now no local residents suffer from unemployment.
More and more stores are opening in the country that sell clothing and equipment for winter sports.
Snack bars are opened on the slopes with dishes of the national cuisine.
Taiwan now even has a testing station for COVID-19.
China is striving to create a prosperous winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders of major international competitions, and its resorts and equipment must reach the global level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, said the WHO
More than 500 million people around the world could be plunged into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed progress towards universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the 12 December International Day of Universal Health Coverage, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
They stated that the pandemic had led to disruptions in healthcare, and had created excessive strain on healthcare systems.
In connection with this, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population with immunization decreased, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s," which made it harder for people to pay for treatment.
This situation is pushing more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic had plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and over four billion people had virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister cut off from "Democracy Summit" broadcast at White House request
Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology Audrey Tang's speech at the panel discussion during the US-organized "Summit of Democracy" was translated into a video-less mode, according to the recording of the summit on YouTube.
The agency Reuters, with reference to sources, asserts that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to their statement, the reason was a map where Taiwan was marked in a separate color from China, which considers the island its territory.
The map that Ms. Tan showed was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries around the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan was marked in green as "free", while China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were marked in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture from her side was replaced by a screenshot with a note saying that the participants' opinions "do not necessarily reflect the position of the U.S. government."
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources point out that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister could contradict Washington’s policy of “one China”.
One source from the agency claimed that after the map was shown, the US National Security Council became angry and called the State Department, accusing it of treating Taiwan as a separate country.
The "Summit for Democracy" organized by Washington took place from December 9 to 10 and was attended by representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil organizations and charity groups.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund, through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council, Yuri Averianov, stated that the summit had an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".
They infuse you with the idea that they are cooking food, and there is always burnt meat, as if the butcher had kept the last piece.
The classic of journalism - to create a news out of nothing.
They don't boil meat, but horns and hooves, obtaining a substance similar to glue.
The finished product looks like a yellow, translucent strip with hardly any smell and is hard, like plastic, and is used as natural gelatin.
In general, harmful substances from the processing of waste are not less than from its decomposition.
But this saves companies huge amounts of money.
That's why there's a fairytale about ecology for the Lohovs, who will also work for free collecting rubbish for the idea.
Personally, my contribution to ecology is refusing to acquire unnecessary things and using them for a long time.
If I go beyond the limits - I don’t throw away, but give to charity.

The Joint Mechanism for Prevention and Control of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China has issued a circular, requiring that prevention and control of the epidemic of COVID-19 be strengthened in cities that have land ports, in order to further prevent the importation of the virus across the border.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities should provide a negative result of the test for nucleic acids of COVID-19 obtained within 48 hours before departure.
Those arriving in cities with land border crossing points must undergo at least one test for COVID-19 nucleic acids on arrival.
The document says that these requirements will be in effect from the date that the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, until March 15, 2022.
It is also noted that cities, in which there are land customs points and which meet certain conditions, may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the epidemic of COVID-19 within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the USA
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington in an interview with Izvestia.
He noted that the long path of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
One-sided negative predictability is there, but as for some prospect of an improvement in relations, it is completely unpredictable.
It's a sad commentary on the long road we've traveled with this administration, and with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not begin yesterday," the diplomat indicated.
According to Riazantsev, the problem is that the United States wants to impose its approaches to a wide range of issues on Russia.
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs added that he would not have dared to give optimistic predictions about the prospects for the improvement of relations and did not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, progress is not being made.
At the same time, Russia calls upon the United States to adopt a responsible approach to questions of international security and hopes that the signals will be heard, and that Americans will listen to the arguments of sound common sense.
Previously, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, during a meeting with American Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, stated that Moscow is prepared to renew dialogue with the USA.
Virologist warns of the danger of nasal vaccination from COVID outside hospitals
Those who have been vaccinated with the nasal spray vaccine against COVID-19 may experience an allergic reaction and require medical assistance, so the first points for vaccination with this preparation should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS to be a virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology at Novosibirsk State University Sergei Netessov.
It is easier to organize points for nasal spray vaccination in airports and shopping centers, but I would do this only in medical institutions at first.
The problem is that the probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine exists, it is small, but it is desirable that a person sits next to the doctor's office after this.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy drugs that work in a minute or two, which is sometimes very useful," Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centres when there is enough experience in the use of the preparation.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a probability that the vaccine will not reach the destination if the person being vaccinated sneezes after the injection when their nose is blocked.

In Great Britain, 1,239 cases of the omicron strain of coronavirus were recorded over the past 24 hours - RT in Russian
In the UK, 1,239 cases of infection with the new omicron strain of coronavirus were identified over the past day.
This was reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the "omicron" strain were recorded in Great Britain, 38 people in Scotland were infected with a new strain of the virus, and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with COVID-19 from the new strain in the UK has reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted in a pessimistic forecast that 75,000 people in England may die due to the outbreak of coronavirus caused by the "omega" strain by April.
Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that introduce anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov commented on possible anti-Russian sanctions in case of further "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including an alleged "invasion" into the country's territory.
It's impossible to introduce some restrictions against Russia and not to suffer yourself," the Kremlin's spokesman said on the air of the "Russia 1" TV channel.
Peskov asserts that "this is understood by everyone in the world".
It was previously reported that the US is considering imposing sanctions on Russia's energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank German Greff is sure that this is impossible.

Imagine you have to explain this to a dim-witted child, how would you do it?!
Remember that in children up to 3-5 years old the channels of communication with the subtle world are still open, and the child may know more than you!)
Residents of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave the composition of France.
This was reported by the French TV channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% voted against independence.
3,51% of the population of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
Annulled the results of 2.99% of the ballots.
The level of participation in the vote was very low: around 55% of the population of the archipelago turned out to vote.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to calls by separatists to boycott the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
Most residents supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
Around 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has a special administrative and territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonia administration allows the region to hold two referendums on its independence, two years apart.

WHO preliminarily considers "omikron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers that "omikron" is less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
At the same time, there are data on a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines against the new variant of COVID-19.
According to information on December 9, "omikron" is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and significantly altered antigenic profile of the Omikron strain protein allow us to assume a reduction in the vaccine's effectiveness in fighting the infection and transmitting the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, the disease ("severity of illness" - very rare) may be less severe than with "classical" infection, - says a technical update from WHO.
The organization notes that all registered cases of infection with "omikron" in the EU are currently mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, according to preliminary data, the new strain spreads faster than "Delta".
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They were "previously vaccinated," the Gamaleya Center said.
Head of Russia's consumer watchdog Anna Popova said there was no reliable information yet that the new coronavirus strain was less dangerous than others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios were named for Zelensky
Ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
According to him, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, as well as possible compromises on Donbass.
This was reported by Denisenko on the "Glavred" portal on Sunday, December 12.
The first option, which Denisenko called an "ideal storm," assumes that Ukraine will stop supporting key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev could face in 2023.
At the same time, there is a reduction in prices for key goods that we traditionally export... Internal protests and resistance to the authorities from key FPGs (financial-industrial groups). - Added the ex-parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against everyone."
This forecast will come true in case of high turbulence in global politics, when Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Under such circumstances, the leadership of Ukraine may make compromises on Donbass, which could lead to confrontation within the country.
At the end of summer, Zelensky's position was weakened, with a probability of such a situation at 50-55%, according to the former MP.
The third scenario for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is confrontation between groups of the population that disagree with Zelensky and the president, as a result of which the capture of control over the power block and the implementation of "populist initiatives" is possible.
In this scenario, Zelensky will start "reshaping power," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into a "father of the nation."
This could be due to some event which will be a strong shock for the society.
“The event should be sufficiently large-scale to provoke a response from our international partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine,” Denisenko said.
This scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological catastrophe or aggressive actions by Russia, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is precisely the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the USA that are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had fallen to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest rating since he became head of state.
Analysts predicted that in the event of the nearest presidential election in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for ex-President Petro Poroshenko.
Only 19.3% of those surveyed supported the president.

Thank you for the story about the great athlete, I did not know that Elena Shushunova died, it is very sad to find out.
I remember how I cheered for her at the Olympic Games in Seoul, for us, residents of Primorye, this was a direct broadcast, real time.
There was so much passion, emotions were running high, I remember the joy when Elena won.
We were also happy about the other victories, as we cheered for Salnikov, for the football players, for all the Soviet athletes.
Once, on TV, I saw a documentary about one of the Central American countries, and there the bananas were loaded onto the ship in barrels, like barrels.
The pumpkins were huge.
I have worked on harvesting and loading pumpkins in the Astrakhan region many times in my youth, and I have never seen pumpkins weighing more than a pood.
I buy pumpkins weighing 4-5 kg directly from the garden and not earlier than the beginning of August.

The poet arrested for the action on Red Square: "For a quote by Yevtushenko, they give you 10 days, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was under arrest for ten days.
A student from the Higher School of Economics was detained on Red Square with a poster that read the hashtag #poetwrosiabiggerthanpoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander under administrative article for repeat violation of the procedure for holding a public event.
He was detained for the first time on 23 January on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
The goal was to attract attention to poetry in general, unfortunately, interest in it was lost, to the decline of culture in Russia in general and the same small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to reveal the message of his poem in more detail.
How were you treated by the police when you were detained?
What did you ask in the department and how did they comment on your action?
This time the employees were more correct, the detention was maximum, polite, as if it were funny in some context.
At Pushkin Square they took OMON officers and took them hard.
They asked the standard questions about motives.
When we heard it in principle, we looked at it to see if it was approved or not.
Everything was impeccably correct, apart from the ventilated on all four sides monkey house, but I knew what was coming.
And if after the action under this hashtag begin to write their poems, even several people, I will not sit idly for 10 days.
Maxim, according to the protocol, let's talk in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events they speak the language of the surrounding area, so that everyone knows what happened in the Bundestag on 25 September 2001, or in their native language via an interpreter.
This is only a protocol, by the way, and incidentally, Angela Merkel speaks Russian perfectly well, but still resorts to an interpreter.
And at official events, a stenographer takes down the record on an old-fashioned typewriter, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.

Scientists reveal how potatoes can help in the fight against age-related diseases
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and microelements that promote improved circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root contains vitamins from group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acid.
All these elements help the systems of the body to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high content of insoluble fiber, it is useful for the digestive system. Regular consumption may also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for maximum benefit, the root vegetable is better to boil or stew, rather than fry in oil.
The Daily Express had previously warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, along with other high-GI foods.
These are products containing carbohydrates that break down quickly into sugars, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic drinks, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in their production in personal subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current deficit of products can only be compensated by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates removed from "Yandex"
Candidates for elimination
In 2015, right holders from the RAEK/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the web, and most of them have now ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, Director of the Institute for Internet Research.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - have managed to survive thanks in part to regular changes of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results as both "Yandex" and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Game of Thrones" and "Grace" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service in Russia ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available to searchers, you can watch the animated novelty "Enkanto", but judging by the quality of the video, this is a so-called screen version (a pirated copy of the film shot in a cinema).
The series "University. 10 Years Later" is available on Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, and on the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-media").

Dimax Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two different surfaces with varying hardness – hard and medium.
The composition of the product includes only quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively on the best side.
Springs: in the center of the model, there is a block of independent springs "micro package".
This means that there are 2,000 spirals on the mattress, which work fully autonomously.
It is their operation that provides unique point adjustment.
The "micro-packet" is the highest frequency of all the diversity of the "Dima" spring block, so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Filling: a combination of layers of coyote fur and natural latex is used on top and bottom.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long been a classic, since it not only provides the mattress with orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the corset provides proper support for the spine, the latex layer adapts the surface to the shape of the human body.
Case: the model is supplied in a simple jersey cover with Aloe Vera print.
It can be made portable or stationary, depending on the client's wishes.
The total height of the product is 27 cm and the recommended load on the sleeping surface is 170 kg.
Guarantee and safety: guarantee period – 3 years.
The mattress has received all necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic pillow, which is used in the mattress, has a CertiPUR certification.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the "Actual Camera" reported on Sunday.
The goal of the launch in five years' time is to assess the suitability of the Venus clouds for life, and then search for life there.
Tartu scientists have developed instruments to measure the acidity and oxygen content in Venusian clouds for the project.
It was previously assumed that Venus' clouds were too acidic for life to exist, but it is likely that Venus was originally a Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a probe should arrive from Venus.
Assuming that we find life there, the main question will be - does it resemble Earth's life or is it different?
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that Earthly life did not start on Earth.
If it is different, it is possible that the origin of life is more likely to be on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project, Mikhkel Pajusalu.

Metaverse will change Russian business
The theme of metaverses became popular in the fall of this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Therefore, business in Russia, like everywhere else in the world, will invest in the creation of their own metaverses and subsequent monetization.
Metropolitan areas should be considered as a continuation of existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend for creating remote interactions in the conditions of the pandemic, because people are tired of loneliness and restrictions.
On the one hand, this is the result of businesses' desire to develop ecosystems and adapt their operational models to them.
The third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to digital format.
Anna, you are right, a change in diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating properly, you don't want anything too fatty and harmful.
Of course, we'll have turkey and all the trimmings, and mashed potatoes under the gravy, but nobody makes me eat it all and right away.
You can eat it by the spoonful, or try it and see.
After all, there are ten days ahead of us, and we can prepare any tasty and useful dishes.

British economist couldn't give forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was not able to give a forecast for 2022 because, in his opinion, such attempts will end in failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the situation.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and second is inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know if the increase in prices for goods was temporary or not.
As an expert pointed out, even before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of central banks' infinite generosity has run its course" and it is time to return to relationships where interest rates that take into account inflation will correlate with expected GDP growth.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policies could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the issue of increasing productivity, as well as poverty and climate change, O'Nill summarized.
Earlier, head of the Global Research Department "Opening Investments" Mikhail Shulgin said that positive expectations for the dollar in 2022 remain, but potential growth will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar, Shulgin named the monetary policy of the Fed, the dynamics of oil prices and fears amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Forced to agree.
But one thing is clear: if you compare yourself to yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's much better now.
There is progress, but it is slow.
There is another problem: in cities there are many ecological initiatives, but people don't know about them.
Any eco-taxis that collect waste from homes.
To put it simply, the point-of-sale for second-hand goods - that's where the marginals go.

Russians spent around 4.5% of the country's GDP on car dealers
At the end of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 78.4 billion rubles on purchasing new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period of the previous year, according to the statistical data of the agency Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - approximately the same sum (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state on supporting citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
In September, at the meeting of heads of states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that such amount is equivalent to more than 4.5% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
On the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is the leader in terms of revenue.
In the first 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars for a total of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than in the same period last year.
Sister brand Hyundai saw a rise of over 35%, and revenue from car sales was valued at RUB 279.3 billion.
In terms of the increase in the average price of a car, this brand is in the lead - over the course of the year, the average price of a Hyundai increased by almost 21%, to 19.4 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had a stronger price increase.
Sales volumes of Korean brands grew less significantly: according to the statistics of the Committee of Automobile Manufacturers Association in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars than in the same period last year.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Completing the top three in terms of sales volume in monetary terms is Japanese Toyota - in the first 10 months of the year, 27.55 billion rubles was spent on cars of this make, which is 14% more than in the same period of the year before.
Mercedes-Benz is in second place among the Japanese with a result of 26.61 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand saw growth in both sales volume (by 37%) and in the average cost of vehicles (by almost 28%, to 820,000 rubles).
There has been a simultaneous increase in sales and the average price at Mercedes-Benz - more, for example, than at BMW - and as a result, there has been a bigger increase in financial reserves, explained Tatyana Arabyan, General Director of NAPAI. -
In terms of growth rates, fantastic figures are being shown by Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial reserves this year."
Russian Lada demonstrates medium dynamics of income growth (plus 28%), and for 10 months Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this make.
Companies whose sales of vehicles in 2021 fell in units are at the same level as last year: for example, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in the red - for 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on off-roaders and pickup trucks of this brand, versus 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of automotive components and disruptions in production, affecting the entire global automotive industry, auto companies continue to make continuous adjustments to prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" raised the price of Lada models seven times over the year, the last increase (by 8-10,000 rubles) occurred at the end of November.
They regularly revise their prices for their products and other car manufacturers.
The volume of the automobile market in Russia will continue to grow in monetary terms – in addition to the deficit of cars, inflation and car manufacturers' desire to make up for previous losses are also contributing to this, experts believe.
In conditions of a shortage of cars, I think that many car companies have even been able to pass some of the costs of previous periods on to consumers, which they were not able to charge for earlier,
says the analyst of "VTB Capital" Vladimir Bespalov. -
I think that, in financial terms, car manufacturers are feeling very good at the moment, maintaining high marginality of sales."
This is evidenced by the growth rates of car prices, which are expected in 2021, the expert says.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative and monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
With the growth of the supply of opportunities for increasing prices, the growth will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian automotive market will continue to grow even in the next year, even if the growth in the cost of vehicles slows down, and automobile manufacturers will be able to receive their profit due to the volume, says Sergey Burgazliev, an independent consultant for the automotive industry.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, auto manufacturers are now striving to get the biggest profit from each sold car, notes Burgazliyev. -
An increase in the volume of production of machines is not expected at least in the next six months, and in Russia the hysteria is also fueled by uncertainty among the population about the future.
In the context of the current market situation, cars have become a good investment object - a car purchased a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its initial cost, an expert concludes.
Biden spoke about the transfer of US troops to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion
The US leadership never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in case of "invasion" by Russia.
Such a statement was made by the President of the USA Joe Biden.
There were never such plans, - the head of the White House stated in reply to a journalist’s question on whether the USA had rejected such an idea.
Biden noted that Russia would face economic consequences if the situation around Ukraine escalates.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the USA will transfer forces to the Nato countries in Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Estonia).
We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all the countries of NATO, for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia - said Biden.
Previously, the press secretary of the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, stressed that Moscow has no intention to invade Ukraine.
At the same time, he indicated that Moscow views the problem in the combat use of drones sent by Turkey to Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are getting closer to our territory."
I immediately leave such interviews.
If already at the interview they want to force me to listen to screams, wait for hours, drink some incomprehensible brew and another cup of tea - I can't imagine what it will be like at work.
I'll find a normal place for myself, without a bureaucratic layer, where you can immediately talk to the head.

If a scammer calls from such a number, for example, "an employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another law enforcement agency, it does not make sense to hang up immediately, but rather to put them on a black list, which will probably take too long.
Because to confirm his lie about the involvement of the power structures, he quickly repeats the call and continues to scare and persuade.
We need more useful recommendations for the people.
Such nonsense...
I don't at all believe it was like that.

And I can even smile at you.
But I remember that the thought is material!
Peter and Nicholas II never signed a death sentence during their reign.
Even such extremists as Koba and his brigade.
And bloody Sunday - that's the invention of the Bolsheviks already.

Film by Alexander Sokurov's student received European "Oscar" for best editing
Nominated for an Oscar, the Russian film “Crushing” won the award of the European Film Academy (also known as the “European Oscar”) in the “Best Editing” category, reports Moskovsky Komsomolets.
The jury of the competition, voting online due to the complicated epidemiological situation, assessed the outstanding mastery of the creators of the film.
The film by Jasmila Žbanić (Bosnia and Herzegovina) “Where Are You Going, Aida?” won the most awards this time.
The main character of the film is a translator for the UN mission, who is trying to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama "Fists of Fury" directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's master class), this film is about the complex relationship between a domineering father and his children who are growing up and want to break free from parental control in North Ossetia.
It was previously announced that this film was nominated for an Oscar as the best foreign language film.
As regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkey show, in my opinion, you are off the topic, to put it mildly.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise KamAZ.
