I don't even want to watch TV anymore...
Is it so hard to be a celebrity? They're on TV all the time.
Yesterday, I watched Netflix's "Terrace House," but I couldn't help but laugh out loud when one of the staff members said something boring.
It is regrettable that there are no funny points even though it is obvious that "it is all a joke because the artist is popular."
But if the staff don't smile, the atmosphere becomes unpleasant, and it's hard to enjoy the work.
In the past, when black-owned businesses were few and far between, sporting events were a great way for people from all walks of life to come together and have a good time, but some egos got too big and it became uncomfortable for everyone else.
On the other hand, there are a lot of people who say, "It's amazing how difficult it is to be an artist."
It is understandable that there are not many people who can make a living by being an artist, but it is regrettable that there are people who think that being an artist is a useless job.
We cannot hear the legitimation that the beautification of one's own career and the entertainers are too high in the media and society.

Merchandise ordered at Tsukumo Net Shop was substituted without permission
To sum up: If you ordered the wireless mouse, the wired version of the mouse will be delivered, and if you want to return it, you were told to send it back.
Although it is troublesome to buy a self-made PC, I cannot help but write because it is a well-known place.
The sales of MSI's wireless gaming mouse, which started from the previous golden week, were discovered to be 3,280 yen (including tax).
Since the price of the wired version was the same as that of the wireless version at the store, I considered the possibility of a price mistake and confirmed the page of the wireless version before ordering.
The order email arrived normally and the shipment email the next day also arrived.
The name of the product, "CLUTCH GM41 Lightweight Wireless," was written in the purchase history of both emails and my page.
Since there was no notification of cancellation from the time of ordering to the time of delivery, I thought that the ordered wired mouse would come at this time.
This is a problem from here. An email saying "There was a registration error for the goods" arrived a few hours after shipment.
According to the email,
The wireless version was sold at a discount, but it was actually the wired version.
Since the wireless mouse has already been shipped,
1. Refuse the acceptance and cancel all
2. Return the mouse alone for refund
3. Use a wireless mouse.
Choose the appropriate response.
The product pages for the wireless and wired versions were divided, and the purchase records were written in the wireless version as well. It was sent by mistake.
I received the goods I bought and the things I didn't buy without knowing, and if I want to return them, can I do it from here?
So, please lend me your wisdom because I want to make a rebuttal.

Isolated for a second time... The only bridge leading to the region was washed away by the typhoon and heavy rain. Residents have tripled their emergency food supplies in Yabu, Fukushima Prefecture (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Matsubo Shouzou, a farmer in Yagisawa Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
The great influence of the three-stranded eight people was the 2019 East Japan earthquake.
Masahiro Motojima said: "At first, I felt like Majika."
It's terrible to think that something like this could happen, and that people could be left isolated in this way." The only road linking the highlands to the rest of the country was washed away in the tsunami, leaving 30 people isolated in their homes in the 11th generation.
Residents who had their water cut off carried necessary supplies over the JR bridge, which usually does not allow pedestrians.
Mr. Matsumoto Hiroshi said, "Generally speaking, it is better to come to the court by car. However, since we can come to this place by walking on the iron bridge even if we get down from the car or take the backpack, I felt the inconvenience of transportation and the lack of convenience of the car." One month later, the emergency bridge completed was isolated from the mainland for several days due to heavy rain.
Although two years have passed since the disaster, Mr. Matsumoto continues to follow the countermeasures that he taught.
Motegi Toshimitsu: "I think there are about 10 cases.
For the time being, it is thought that it is necessary to ensure the supply of food for two to three days. Food that can be used for very food, such as canned food and cup noodles, is about three times as much as before the disaster.
Ms. Mitsuko Sato: "I don't know when a disaster will strike me. So I keep preparing for it. I feel that it is better to be safe than sorry." On the other hand, Yabu, which has experienced the "disaster beyond imagination",
In order not to forget the lessons, the town has started its own initiatives since 2021.
Takahashi Yoshinori, the homeroom teacher of Class 1 at Yayoi Elementary School: "I want to think about what we can do to prepare for disasters on October 12, which is the day designated as the 'Yayoi Disaster Prevention Day' in the shape of 'Disaster Prevention Day.'"
So far, awareness has been raised about the possibility of unexpected events.

The "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
1. Activating the second-hand housing market 2. The newly established "Building Condition Survey" system The second-hand housing market is popular.
House prices are increasing, and the market for renovation is also expanding.
On the one hand, the popularity of the words such as "front station, nearby station, and direct connection" and "large-scale" and "tower" is increasing, which represent the properties. It is also affected by the fact that relatively safe new buildings are being built.
However, compared to overseas, the circulation of existing (used) houses in Japan is still low.
In 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) started a building condition survey aimed at ensuring the safety and security of used-house transactions, known as an inspection, in order to partially amend the Building Transaction Law (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/12199000.pdf).
This is a system in which builders who are familiar with houses check the condition of the houses including deterioration and report it.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that both buyers and sellers benefit from inspection.
The seller can avoid the clawback by conducting a property survey before the sale and purchase, giving the buyer peace of mind.
It is due to the discrimination of the competitive objects.
On the other hand, even for the buyer, it is possible to grasp the state of the used house that is scheduled to be purchased, and it is possible to purchase it in a system that can be said to be advantageous.
On the current system, the main party that has the authority to conduct the building condition survey is the seller.
In addition, it is also important to pay attention to the fact that the notification of the inspection system called "Akumu" alone has become a duty.
In other words, it is the duty of the real estate agent who is responsible for the mediation to explain, "It is possible to introduce architects who carry out building condition surveys in the case of property mediation," or "It is not possible," but it is not obligatory to implement it.
Inspection of brokers, who take the lead, brings about the risk In contrast, when you turn your eyes to overseas markets, in active America and the UK, for example, the same system is already in place.
In the initial stage of home purchase, the buyer relies on specialists called "inspectors" or "building surveyors" who conduct building surveys on behalf of the buyer.
For example, in the United States, 70 to 90 percent of the inspections of used houses are carried out.
In terms of the fact that the "buyer" led the inspection, the main difference between the Japanese-style inspection as a "seller" and its nature was great.
The seller side tends to show the condition of the building at least, try to make it higher, and sell it early.
On the other hand, the buyer's side considers that it is safe to stay because it is satisfied with the inspection results.
Despite the same inspection, the purpose and thinking of both sides are at odds.
As a result, the following points are pointed out as risks for Japan's system.
● The scope of inspection of the seller-dominant type prescribed by the government will be minimized.
Since there is no detailed survey, there is a risk of overlooking really important inadequacies. ● For the inspection company, the brokerage firm (sales agency) that introduces the responsibility cases can be the same as the customer.
There is a possibility that inspections are carried out in a "careless" manner, such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the principals.

Was Ginza an island?
Five random things to talk about while wearing silver bracelets (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
「Ah, this used to be the Ryukyu Islands.
The evidence for that is ... well, it's a bit of a stretch even for New York.
I'll introduce you to some trivia about the Empire State Building that you might not know.
Up to the top of the Ginza! ?
First entry into the Tokyo Stock Exchange
When you walk around the Ginza, you can still find the traces of the history which has been carved on the ground, such as the names of the changing winds, the mysterious stones, and the numerous temples.
Walking with the woman to the Ginza, I unintentionally stumbled upon the silence of "this used to be the Ryukyu Kingdom.
Was Ginza in Katsushika?
The nickname for bustling shopping streets that have sprung up everywhere in Japan, such as "Ginza" in Tokyo's Chiyoda Ward.
In fact, "Ginza" is the name of the mint where silver coins were minted. In 1612 (Keicho 17th year), the Ginza Office where silver coins were minted was transferred to the current city of Shizuoka.
At that time, it was called the "New Renga Town," but it was called the "Ginza" when it was transferred to Yurakucho.
In fact, a "peninsula" protruded to the sea near the Ginza.
Up until the Edo Period, the Sumida River flowed within a circular moat, and the half-island of "Edojima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of that peninsula is now where the Financial District is.
Tokugawa Yorinobu opened the Edo government and buried the moat to advance the repair of the Kyobashi area.
Furthermore, to improve the living environment of the town and develop the shipping industry, the government has invested heavily in the improvement of the town.
Then, they cut down the trees and mountains, and buried the rivers.
In front of the Tiffany & Co. flagship store in Ginza 2-7 (Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument indicating the location of the former Ginza police box, so if you are interested, you can try to find it.
Knowledgeable people know the "sacred pilgrimage" of the Ginza
In Ginza, the "Ginza Hachiman Shrine Neighborhood Pilgrimage" known to the locals, is held every year.
Among the 10 or more sacred places, the most eye-catching is the "Shrine of the Kagura Gods" in front of the Kabuki Theatre.
The number of people who come to see a play and then leave has decreased.
On the one hand, the "immortal dragon" is on the ceiling of the Ginza Matsuya, while the "Ginza Shiseidō" is on the Ginza Terasse 9th floor.
Shrines such as Tamagawa Hachiman Shrine, Atsuta Hachiman Shrine, and Toyohashi Hachiman Shrine are located along the road, but they are somewhat hidden and Toyohashi Hachiman Shrine is known to have been respected by the geisha and actor Yamamura Kanzaburō. The "Hachiman Shrine of Success" on the 1F of the Ginza Wako Building, which is otherwise not open to the public.
Around this shrine, there are places where people worship the gods of war and the earth, but most shrines worship the god of harvest by offering rice.
The "Inari Shrine" which welcomes the fox in front of the shrine is built in a place where there are many farmers, and the benefit of "Five Grain Abundance" which the farmers can harvest well is believed.
As a result, it is said that there are benefits to merchants in cities such as Kyoto and Edo, where there are many temples and shrines, and even in bustling shopping districts such as Tokyo's Ginza, there is a wide variety of beliefs.

South Korea's Posco International has acquired Senegal's Enagie, expanding its overseas gas business - South Korea report (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Posco International announced on the 12th that it had concluded an investment commitment for the acquisition of shares of Senex Energy and Hancock Energy, which were taken over by Seneka Energy.
At present, there are still some procedures such as the approval of the general meeting of shareholders and local corporations left in the state where the conclusion of the purchase and sale is scheduled to be completed in March next year.
This year's acquisition is the world's largest acquisition and merger (M&A) case after Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group in 2010.
The purchase amount was 770.9 billion won, and Posco International decided to invest 50.1% and Hancock Energy decided to invest 49.9% respectively.
Even in the era of energy transition, the demand for natural gas continues to increase, and blue natural gas, which is the foundation of the natural gas market, accounts for two-thirds of the market with green natural gas in the hydrogen market, and the purchase was decided on the basis of this.
In this purchase, Posco International secured 80.2 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas storage equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as personnel for the onshore gas field in Jeju.

The pain in my knee, if only it were "arthritis of the knee"! ?
Different treatment methods (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editorial Department: Recently, my knee pain has continued.
What kind of illness is possible?
Mr. Maruyama: The causes of pain in the knee joint are diverse, such as knee arthritis, joint rheumatism, and inflammation.
In fact, the most common disease among Japanese is "arthritis".
Editorial Department: Is it true that the joints are deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which cushions the impact and enables smooth movement of the joint.
However, due to aging, obesity, and strenuous sports, the cartilage may become thinner and deformed.
As a result, joint deformation and inflammation occur.
Editorial Department: Is it true that joint deformities can be found outside the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, the joints and attachments of the fingers, toes, head, waist, and feet can also cause pain.
But by far the most common is a case called "arthritis of the knee."
Editorial Department: So, what kind of structure is a joint?
Mr. Maruyama: The joints are formed by two bones coming together.
The part where the two meet is covered with "synovial cartilage", and the area around the joint is covered with "synovial membrane".
Editorial department: It's a complicated structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
The inner layer of the capsule is an organ called the synovial membrane, which makes synovial fluid.
This joint fluid lubricates the joint and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
It is said that "to make the knee movement smoothly, it is good to take Hyaluron acid and Condroic acid."
Editorial Department: What kind of symptoms do you get when you have a deforming joint disease?
Mr. Maruyama: The joint cartilage is elastic and has a role of preventing direct contact between the bones.
It's like a Cushion role, isn't it?
However, if it is twisted or distorted, it causes pain or inflammation.
Do you sleep in pajamas?
Basically, I'm a pajama person, but when I'm in pajamas, I feel like I'm wearing jammies to bed!
Even in a car, do people who smoke cigarettes have the right to infringe on the non-smokers' rights?
Yes, there are two types.

The 3 best gambles and games from the "Kaiji" series that you can actually experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The explosive popularity of the manga series "Kaiji," which focuses on a man.
One of the flavors of this work is an extreme game of life.
【Photos】Just by looking, my legs feel like they're going to give out... Taking on the challenge of crossing the steel bridge!
So this time, I would like to check the game that can actually be played, or the game that is practiced in the project video.
The trap-filled pachinko parlor where the character "Mune" first appears in "Pachinko Breaker"
In the original work, at a high rate of 1 ball for 4000 yen, the cue was shocked.
This "mire" is ensnared by big traps such as "Nursery Rhyme", "Moveable Object" and "Triple Crown".
Though Kaji used every means at his disposal, including bribery, and finally resorted to digging up the floor of the building to lay a vinyl water pipe, he met with no success.
The "mud" that appears in the cage is actually Pachinko, and many people are playing it.
Naturally, things like "1,000 yen for one pear" and "2,000 yen for one apple" are not as common as they used to be, but it is possible to get a feel for the old-fashioned prices just by tasting the fruit.
The "Star Side Party", which was held by the gold holders as a relief measure, implemented the repayment of the debt to the debtors who included the kaijō in the iron bones crossing.
The creditors scampered up the delicate steel bones installed 10 meters above the ground, trying to reach the top as fast as lightning.
Up to 12 people can take part, but there are only four steel cables, and safety measures are insufficient, so the possibility of death is fairly high.
This bridge is very dangerous, but it is also the closest experience to the VR game. You can experience it at the "Egret Bridge" installed at the base of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, the original of the pro baseball team.
The Egg Bridge is a 20-meter-high (seven-storey building) steel arch bridge located at the site, and "Sky Bridge" and "Victory Bridge" are prepared to face each other.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Corea, the comedian, posted a video of himself walking over the bridge on his YouTube channel with the title, "Iron Man can experience Japan," which went viral.
■ E Card 2-person battle card game, "E Card".
The emperor's card is 1, the citizen's card is 8, and the slave's card is 1, making a total of 10 cards used for the emperor vs. slave game.
The game is very well done, the emperor is strong against citizens, citizens are strong against slaves, and slaves are strong against the emperor.
Kaiji, in the play, fights against Genkai with a harsh rule, "If you lose, you'll cut your own ears off."
The device that breaks the earphone, which is attached to the conclusion of the bitter war, is transmitting the psychology by sensing the change of the pulse and the temperature. The kite, which is aware of the psychology by reading the change of the pulse and the temperature, disrupted the Garonne by reducing the extreme value of its own ears.
The card is sold in stores, and can be purchased at places like Amazon.
YouTube has uploaded a video of popular YouTuber Hikaru, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, defeating Eikura Nana, who played the role of Erika, with an ECG.
Is it possible to taste the air?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kai's, but it's a fact that reading manga can make you feel better.
Maybe you can feel that worldview through the game.
A step towards the new year, and kindly escorting the deer to the Shinto shrine | Yamagata News
The preparations for the new year are under way at the guardian shrine of the prefecture (Yamagata City), and the big horse of the zodiac sign of the ox (taurus) appeared.
On the 11th day of the month, the designers of the Tohoku Crafts and Arts University visited the shrine and offered a ritual at the shrine.
The shrine has been relying on craftsmen to create the original drawings of the horse since last year.
This time, nine people who participated in the Japanese Painting Course taught by Professor Motoyuki Endo drew the work of 22-year-old Tsuchiya Yui.
The giant horse is 3.3 meters tall and has a height of about 1.8 meters at its center.
Tsuchiya drew an image of "leaving the old year behind and stepping into the new year with a grateful heart, as if the plum blossom is kindly pushing me forward."
The figure of a man gazing at the cherry blossom, which has stopped in its tracks, contains the wish that even in a world that changes violently, "there is sufficient leeway to appreciate the beauty of nature."
The design of Tsuchiya-san is generally depicted as a horse.
Kenji Gobara, 44, of Kesennuma in Miyagi Prefecture, said, "I think it will help everyone to overcome the difficulties."

I want to continue living in Yamaguchi "I want to continue living in Yamaguchi"
What kind of town was Yamano in 2030?
Students' representatives from four universities and colleges in Yokohama have joined a workshop to think about the slogan "Stay in Yokohama" through the contract.
As a part of the survey and policy proposal business of the intermediate support organization "Yamagata SDGs Mirai Center", the voices of young people were summarized and proposed to the mayors.
When is it fun?
In response to the question of what it feels like to be a facilitator, the student answered that it feels like "being on top of the world when many people are cheering you on," or "feeling like a hamster running on a wheel."
It was held for the first time at the Nippon Club on November 13.
Eighteen college students and the people in the region talked about the "island" decided by each theme while moving the "World Cafe" method. They considered about "a fascinating town", "an easy-to-live town" and "a town where you can feel the life".
Each thought was written on a slip of paper and pasted on the modeling paper.
A town with many young people is lively. "Communications such as trains and buses are not necessary for a convenient life."
We have nothing in common, so let's talk.
Yamano thought it would be boring, but it was fascinating to be able to cycle on the seashore," said Yamano, a third-year student at Yamano Commercial High School (18).
A third-year student at Binnan High School (18), who was born in 2001, said, "There are not many shops here, and it is inconvenient to get around, but it is nice to see that nature has been well taken care of."
The second one in December was just for university students to gather and discuss the contents of the proposal.
The mayor and the education commissioner will also hold a news conference in February.
The president of Toho Gakuen said, "In addition to cultivating the hometown love of university students, if young people are involved in the decision-making process, they will become the key players."

It's not that I didn't like that kind of bickering, but there was a sense that "it's impossible to work together." There was a sense of that in the air, and the fact that the Beatles had that sense is what's interesting about the legend unraveling.
And everyone can really only bloom in such air.
A bit of a phrase from each other, "What's with that?", and the process of going to "that song" is annoying.
In particular, the moment when Get Buck appears is amazing.
The funny nose song, Sarigenai FUN FUN FUUUUUUUUUUUN, gradually turns into ZUCHA♪ZUCHA♪ as the scene where the lyrics enter is firmly recorded.
It is amazing to see the process of composition in such a way.
After all, since everyone is fat, we're all happy just watching the play.

Large-scale damage from tornadoes in America (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
On the night of the 10th (Friday) and the morning of the 11th (Saturday) local time, tornadoes were widespread in the southern United States.
At this time, there was a strong cooling influence from the record warmth, and the state of the air became very unstable due to the rapid development of convective clouds.
Warm air from the Southwest flowed into the southern United States, resulting in record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperature in the local time on the 9th (Monday) and 10th (Tuesday) was around 30℃.
In such a warm record, in the vicinity of the sky at an altitude of 5,500 meters, where the strong cold of -30 degrees Celsius came from the south, an active front was formed due to the large temperature difference, and the cumulus clouds developed rapidly in the shape of the front.
It is said that the dragon dance occurred repeatedly around the festival.
The southern United States is prone to tornadoes, but since the onset of summer since early summer, there have been few cases of serious damage.
The 1-day-old dragon roar warning issued in winter came true 150 times near.
The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had reports of more than 400 squalls and tornadoes on the 10th local time (Monday).
This suggests the presence of two concentrated areas, one in the south along the line from Kentucky to Texas, and the other in the north, including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (improved Fujita scale) indicated that the intensity of the tornado was EF3, reaching 207mph, with violent tornadoes of 70mph in gusts seen to pass momentarily.
There is a possibility that it will be judged as EF4～5 in the future.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version of the improved Tsunami Scale) is used, which is based on the improved Tsunami Scale and takes into account the situation of buildings in Japan.
JEF3, which corresponds to the American hurricane, has a high possibility of occurring in Japan as well, and wooden houses can be destroyed at this level.

Miyagi's plea for help through live broadcasting, "the biggest in history" - Yahoo! News
With regard to the damage caused by Typhoon Hagibis in the middle and south of Japan, Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan, on October 11 (October 12, Japan time), showed a mysterious face with "the biggest typhoon in the history of the United States" as a backdrop.
CNN and other media reported.
Baiden stressed that "as a federal government, we will do everything."
The full extent of the damage is still not clear, it said.
The death toll exceeded 100.
Photos: Residents carry household items from a damaged house to their new residence in the aftermath of a tornado in Kentucky A total of more than 30 tornadoes hit at least six states, including Kentucky, from Sunday evening to Monday morning.
However, records of damage caused to 219 miles (around 350 kilometers) including Mizoram in 1925 are still remaining. However, the maximum scale was calculated to be about 250 miles (around 400 kilometers) by the meteorologist of CNN.
The Mifflinville, Pennsylvania, plant, which made toys for Christmas, had to be shut down for 24 hours because of the damage.
At that time, 110 people were working, but the building was destroyed and the traces were erased.
In the darkness, a woman who had stopped moving under the roughly 1.5-meter-thick rubble was able to feel the weight of the rescuers searching for her on top of the rubble through the live broadcast from a smartphone.
In addition to the female voice calling for help, the song "Happy Birthday to You," which is sung while crying in order to terrorize another woman, was also heard in the live broadcast.
Anbar Brown, a convenience store clerk who lives in Meaford, Ontario, Canada, took cover in the basement with his 5-year-old son when he heard the tornado warning on the radio.
The sound of the train was loud, but it was a scary sound like an earthquake.
The police officer of Meifield City Police said, "The search operation will continue until it is no longer necessary.
We don't know how many weeks, months or years it will take," he said, continuing the desperate search and rescue effort.
Amazon warehouse in the state of Illinois collapsed and at least six people were confirmed dead.
The impact of the derailment of the train and the blockade due to the fall of vehicles on the high-speed road are occurring simultaneously.

The job of a full-time employee who lives in a company dormitory - Dormitory Job Search (Sminavi)
There are many people like that because the related search is "translation and stay".
Bank accounts and credit card contracts can be concluded even if there is only a residence at the first time, but the credit card (and the debit card that can be treated as a credit card) cannot be updated if there is no residence (because the new card is sent to the registered residence).
What does it mean to be a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology?
A "specialist" is a doctor who has been practicing for 3 to 5 years after graduation.
It is also called "Specialized Medicine" and "Postgraduate Medicine".
What is referred to as a "research medical doctor" is in fact a "junior research medical doctor" and refers to doctors who have graduated and worked for one to two years.
If you call it immature, I'd say I'm immature but to the extent that I'll be able to have a diagnosis in four to five years, I'll be able to do a lot of work.

It is an old saying that the evaluation system of the star system is different.
On the other hand, those foreign countries have been arguing that they would like to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to the level of five percent of the 1990 base year, while Japan has been arguing that it would like to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to the level of three percent of the 1990 base year.
There is a two-star difference at the time of the reference point, and four stars are "a work that has a minus element" and "a good work though not a masterpiece".
When the five-pointed star is used as a criterion, works of art that are "truly outstanding even among the best" and "truly exceptional" are likely to end up in the same category. Therefore, there is a tendency to think that a system that does not prompt the meaning of the star rating when there is such a tendency is likely to be defective. However, since such a system is already in place, it would be better not to use the star rating of three (bad) stars.
That's why it's hard to argue against Steam's 2-star reviews.

Heart pounding. There's no way it's that bad. (I'm not that drunk.)
Speed, of course, is slow.

The view around me is painful, but it's painful in a way that makes me feel like I'm being watched, and it hurts my heart.
Overall, it was not bad, but there was still room for improvement.
It's regrettable that we have to consider the possibility that there are few people and that we have to be careful even if we just send a message.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to make a dedicated lane so that I would not interfere with the people who were walking ahead of me.
However, since there were only a few people, I thought it would be better if there were more people.
As for the future, whether or not such automatic driving will become the mainstream, I felt a sense of anticipation from the fact that the discomfort in my peripheral vision hurt a little and I was impressed by how tough-hearted the driver was.
It was embarrassing.

The long journey of a family who planted environmental protection activities on the Chinese border (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
（Gotoh Yukiji: Hong Kong Enterprises Find Asia Consultant） China, with its vast land, is important in terms of biological diversity. There are about 1,600 species of breastfeeding animals in the world, and China ranks first. There are about 30,000 species of plants in the world, and China ranks third.
The autonomous region recognizes the value of biodiversity as such, and the autonomous region is not only performing environmental protection but also promoting the activities of environmental activists in the region.
Siem Reap Province in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is also one of such regions.
Her sister, Ms. Li Yongmei, is a popular actress. Xishuangbanna is a region located at the juncture of Laos, Myanmar, and China's Yunnan province, and is the hometown of the "Dai (Tai) people," who share the Tai and Lou ethnic groups with the Kingdom of Thailand.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through the countries of Southeast Asia, is flowing.
Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province Xishuangbanna covers just 0.2% of China's territory, but it is home to about 25% of China's wild animal species and 20% of its plant species.
This time, I would like to thank Ms. Li Xiaopan, who is conducting environmental protection activities in Shexuanna, for allowing me to learn about her activities on the spot.
German husband and wife start environmental protection activities together -- It has been 20 years since we started the environmental protection activities.
What was the trigger?
Mr. Li: Our environmental protection activities, "Tian Chu," have been carried out since 2000.
That's my husband, Josef Margraf.
Her husband, who was born in Germany, came to Seoul to work on a joint scientific project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest in China, and it boasts a high degree of biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, the economic development was sluggish.
As a result, in order to establish industries in this region, China has started a large-scale harvesting of natural rubber, which has been insufficient in the country.
The husband was sent here from Germany for the restoration of natural resources and the study of biological resources.
And here I am, a married man because of you.
Did Mr. Li not have any interest in natural conservation before?
Mr. Li I was born in Xishuangbanna, but I have no interest in the significance and biological diversity of tropical rainforests.
As a result, it became necessary to promote the project together with my husband.
Even if you have a nice face, there are people who don't have a special back. So, why do you stare at them?
A popular actor said that.
Ora is not that kind of person.
In a moment where you have faith in yourself, something natural comes out.
That person certainly has a lot of confidence.
High-performance, high-quality running gear is a craftsman's handiwork.
Shipping is free for purchases over 10800 yen.
Well, I guess it's true that you can tell a lot about a person by the way they dress.
Are you okay?
I can see it.
I don't think so.
So I don't know what it means.
Is it alright if you tell me in detail?
What would happen if Sasuke confessed?
「Sakura-san confessed, and my heart is filled with spring, so thank you,」 I replied with a smile.
And to get along, I think it's important to share the knowledge of the game and to have a common interest.
We would like to open a Rakuten Securities account. However, since we have chosen not to open a NISA account, can it be opened at a later date?
At the same time, it will be easier to complete the procedures.
It took about a week.
In addition, I would like to recommend the opening of the NISA account at the same time since it is convenient to use.

【Omamura/Personal Memory】Since the cause of CTD became the MOD environment, it took about a half a year to determine the cause.
Since the data became stable in March, there are several factors that cause CTD. It took a lot of time to confirm the time because we only checked it at the weekend center.
Why wasn't the log analyzed with the .Net Script Framework (it would have taken minutes to figure out)? Some of the errors related to the .dll series and the messaging system remain in the crash log.
The main timing of CTD
The log of all PAPILS and .NET Script Framework, and the log of the remaining type of .dll plug-ins are not deleted.
* When an NPC kills/attacks accumulate: even the console kill is activated → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/powerofthree revised and updated) OFF improved ※ Is it possible to get wet?
When the camera work for launching a coup d'état against an NPC character is activated, the setting of the coup d'état can be turned off via the .ini file: Is the setting of the coup d'état related to DAR and Nemesis competing? However, the maximum number of DAR animation is less than 10,000.
（Basically, outside the house） When moving in the field and casting a magic (for example, ice rune), NPC hit time: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID application settings (on the right side of the MCM) are all OFF, and all the improvements are made in 5 consecutive attempts.
Was it a misconfiguration of additional armor and body meshes used by an actor/NPC? In any case, the default ini file for SPID usage in version 2.0 has a syntax error, but the result is intended to apply the Perk to NPCs.
At first, we focused on the motion/battle MODED related to the attack target and OnHit, but we got such a result.
At least in English, German and French, there was no similar bug report.
If there are many people who have the same CTD problem in the Japanese language environment, it may be useful to refer to it.
Everyone is talking about it,
I don't care about that, and my colleagues are like family.
Looking around, that person seems to be working hard though they look like they're enjoying themselves.
But he may be a bit of a mental case.
I'm not mentally ready to retire, but I thought there was a limit before retirement.
Thinking about the importance of spiritual care - today's visitation is over
As I suffer from bilateral defect, I have been undergoing long-term treatment with visits to the optometrist, but I have been treated by the optometrist (female) who has been taking care of me for a long time and has built a very good relationship with me.
I talk about different things every week.
Of course, some things that are necessary for drug management (such as packaging) will come in handy. However, more than that, I thought how important fun communication is for people who have mental disorders during today's visiting nursing.
Today, there was a discussion about gender inequality, but there was also a discussion about gender theory.
As for the sex drive of men and women, and how she got divorced, do you think it's OK to talk about such things?
But sometimes I dressed as a woman.
However, when the nursing care station where the psychiatric hospital is located is visited, the nurses who used to work in the wards could not respond to the matter because they were busy, and the nurses who worked in the nursing care station came and said, "We are doing medical care," and so on.
What I use is a small visiting podiatry clinic run by a charity, but I think of Frank, who has mental illness, as well as of equals, and I think he is a good podiatrist.
I am a beautiful woman.
I hope that those who have received a visit from a psychiatrist will consider it, and those who have not will also consider it.
Visiting the hospital is very important for people with mental disorders.
If the doctor recognizes it, please take it.
And choose a good visiting station.
Previously, even if I was angry, there was nothing I could do. There were times when I wanted to break the contract.
I'm sorry.
I knew it was a fake because it was written in English.
Why do you speak English?
There are various reasons, for example...
・The person who made it is unknown.
・Inadequacy of language judgment
・The browser settings are in English.
The ranking of the number of appearances in the top 6 is all odd.
Why is the number 50 special?
It's amazing.
There seems to be a pattern.
Just keep repeating it.
The telephone network was down due to the corona virus.
But I can't concentrate on work at home.
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.
It's hard to drink coffee.
What are you all doing?
I'm laughing because you opened the door and didn't stop talking.
I feel like it's only a little bit.
Same goes for the touch screen on the phone.
South Korea's patent on hydrogen technology, China's 51%... "Hydrogen Economy Loading Delayed" (Central Japan News Japanese Edition) - Yahoo! News
The South Korean government announced the hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
Up to 65,000 fuel cell vehicles were to be popularized (on a cumulative basis) by 2022, and 310 hydrogen stations were to be operated across the country.
The target price of hydrogen was 6,000 yen per kilogram (about 577 yen).
However, as of November this year, the fuel cell vehicle reached only 27% of the target (about 1,700 units).
The popularity of the core infrastructure of hydrogen stations is also 38% of the target (about 117 places), and the price of hydrogen per kilo is 8,400 yen, which is not much different from the map released at that time.
It has been recognized that the performance of the government's hydrogen economic load map is worse than the target value.
On the 12th, the National Federation of Economic Associations (Nippon Keidanren) released a report titled "The Current Situation and Policy Directions of the Hydrogen Economy."
According to the report, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on the United States and Japan.
Carbon fiber, the core component of fuel cell vehicles, is supplied by Toho Tenax (Japan), BASF (Germany), DuPont (USA), and 3M (USA).
The number of patents on hydrogen technology in six countries leading the world (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% per year (from 2014).
South Korea ranks fifth in the world in terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel batteries (2014-2020).
However, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce said that "in fact, six countries account for the majority of the world's hydrogen market, and in reality, the competing countries are ranked lower."
The national patent rankings are China, the United States, EU, and Japan.
Since 2017, China has been number one in the US, widening the gap.
The number of patents registered in 2020 was 1,033 for Japan (974 items) to take the fourth place, but the 22% threshold for China (4,721 items) was exceeded.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry proposed to designate "national strategic technologies" that have a large reduction effect on the amount of equipment investment and research and development expenses for hydrogen technology.

Parliament on Sunday?
Chirashi made of TV anime series The ongoing reform of the House of Representatives is also reflected in the "communication notebook" of the lawmakers: Dō-shin Electronic Newspaper
The Town Council has introduced unique reforms, such as the creation of a charter and the introduction of a "communication book" for residents to evaluate their councillors.
The town meeting was held for three consecutive periods without any vote, which shows the concern of the townspeople.
In order to make known the Sunday meeting held on the 12th, it distributed about 1,800 copies of the new edition of "Chirashi" on the 9th.
「Asa no Goron」, 「Zessho no Heya」, 「Sawamura Gentaro Series」...
The chirashi sushi distributed by the town council on the 9th was full of witty phrases that reminded people of popular TV dramas.
Shotaro Yagi, a member of the House of Representatives who was involved in creating the video (43), said, "I want to run for the House with a smile on my face."

Micronesia and Assistance Weapons Arrive in Ukraine (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
Ukrainian authorities said on August 12 that small arms and ammunition including grenade launchers and ammunition, which had been reported to have arrived in Ukraine, were based on the assistance plan that the Bihac authorities had recognized.
A total of US$60 million (about JPY6.8 billion) in military aid is dispatched to Ukraine, which is equivalent, including the last equipment such as the radar for specifying the launch site of the artillery such as the howitzer.
According to the Carrie report officer of the U.S. Department of Defense, these assistance also included death-causing weapons such as the tank missile "Javelin".
The military support is aimed at strengthening the defense capabilities of Ukraine, including the increase of troops along the border with Russia.
The U.S. and its allies are on alert against any provocation by the Russian military and are consulting each other in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to prepare for a response in case of a Russian attack on Ukraine.
On September 1 this year, when the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, visited the White House, he admitted the use of weapons.
U.S. military assistance to Ukraine this year has reached about $45 million.
Russia's aid to Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula was over $2.5 billion.
The U.S. military also follows the training schedule of the Ukrainian army.
In the previous month, the state troops in Florida were dispatched in accordance with the common training plan among many countries supported by Ukraine.
According to the statement of the US Department of Defense, the US European Command has played a significant role in the training and advice of the Ukrainian special forces.
The number of U.S. troops operating in Ukraine is not disclosed as a secret.
Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, held a telephone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart on the 7th of this month, but the situation in Ukraine was tense.
In the event of an invasion, the United States shows a tough attitude of imposing economic sanctions.

The pre-death donation "ban" and the donation tax "examination" of the consecutive donation and donation tax, the former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party tax policy committee, Akira Amari!
The first special issue of Weekly Diamond on December 18th is titled "Family talk at the end and beginning of the year!"
It is a "pre-death donation and solicitation."
In the midst of the debate over the integration of the consumption tax and the income tax, the proposed 2022 tax reform package, which was hazy, was shown. In the near future, the pre-paid income tax, which is the king of the consumption tax countermeasures, will become less likely.
How will the rules change?
Together with the direct hit on the former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's tax commission, Akira Amari, and an opportunity to meet during the year, I will teach you the basics of tax reduction techniques without wasting time.
（Diamond Editing Department, Miyahara Takeshi)
From the investors to the company staff in the urban area. The pre-service donation is treated as a "fingerprint" to impose a tax. "From the perspective of integrating the concurrent tax and donation tax more, the construction of a neutral tax system aiming at the selection of the timing of the asset transfer is carried out."
In a statement issued by the party last year on the reform of the tax system in 2021, large-scale fluctuations were observed not only in the upper class but also in the middle class.
The reason for this is that what they say amounts to changing the rules of the game and imposing a big tax increase on successive governments by making "inheritance tax" a taboo.
The steel rule of the progressive high-concentration tax is "to reduce the taxable property."
Its strongest feature is that it has been widely used to reduce the withholding tax on dividends paid to employees who live in the three major cities, thanks to the fact that there are many employees who live in the three major cities.
Such a discussion on "the integration of the consumption tax and the income tax."
The 20-year plan to revise the tax system announced on December 10, 2018, which was proposed with the concept of introducing the tax system as soon as possible, stated that "it is necessary to see the difference between the current progressive tax system and the annual gift system." "The non-taxable treatment of the gift tax is a system that does not impose any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the scope of the limit (Minzu)," etc. (Minzu), etc. (Minzu), etc. (Minzu).
In the investigation of this editorial department, the former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Commission and the former secretary-general of Abe's cabinet, Akira Amari, said so.
It's a big deal to gain or lose benefits depending on the timing of asset transfers.
What kind of problems come up (as a result of integration)? That's what the simulation is for," he said. There are three chances left for the last-minute amendment.
Even so, in the near future, it would be a grave mistake to invalidate the lump-sum tax compensation as a measure against the consumption tax.
However, what will change in the rules for concession tax and donation tax?

【NFL】Team won 3 passes in 1 game. What were the players feeling? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
Jones threw just three passes all night, completing two of them for touchdowns.
This is the fewest appearances by a Bill in the past 50 NFL seasons since they were 2-10 in Week 3 of 1974 at New York Jets.
In 1974, the Bullets had an all-time great in O.J. Simpson, who topped 2,000 yards in a season for the first time in history.
Building beat Simpson and another RB, Marcus Blakeston, for the touchdown.
The biggest reason why Petitjean launched such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town near the Canada-U.S. border, which has remained unchanged from the Strait of Belle Isle in the north.
And on this day, the temperature was almost the same as the previous day, but the wind speed was 18m/s, which blew the snow away.
The buildings were all in the local area, so there was no change in the selection of players.
The lap time is 25 seconds for 30 laps.
Arlen's pass was 15/30 for 145 yards.
Interceptions were not made, and it was impossible to intercept.
There were four Red Zone invasions in the 10-game offensive series and one try.
In particular, the third quarter ended with three consecutive advances to the red zone.
However, it only won 3 points in 3 games.
The final goal before the defense.
The building chased the 4th down to the 3rd & 9 and then to the 3rd & 14.
The goal was 18 yards.
On 3rd & 14, QB Allen was surrounded by rush and escaped right from the pocket.
And Endzone's Teddson Nocks tried to pass but failed.
On this play, Eagles WR Stefon Diggs was wide open down the right sideline, but the throw was behind him and out of his reach.
On 4th & 18, Allen lined up WR Gabriel for a left sideline throw, but the pass was deflected at the line of scrimmage and picked off by DB Miles Bryant to seal the loss.
Brian was covering WR Calvin Ridley of the Falcons with a man-to-man coverage but released the coverage and reacted to Allen's movement in the middle of the way.
Allen, who lost his two receivers, threw two touchdown passes to reach the end zone.
The fourth down was a make-or-miss situation, but the third down did not require a touchdown.
It is good to get a first down in two plays.
Since it was only 2 minutes, I had no choice but to do my best at 4th & Short.

Slowly but surely, "thrown away" and "replaced" items that have been kept in the kitchen for a long time are selected (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
No matter how frequently it is replaced, it is unlikely to be replaced as frequently as it is promoted.
From a study in 2017, it was found that even if kitchen sponges were sterilized every day by electronic sterilization, it was understood that bacteria were breeding a lot (electronic sterilization is also recommended).
The German researchers, who carried out the study, recommend sponging the teeth once a week to keep them clean.
Mana board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said that it is necessary to replace the board when it is scratched or gouged.
It becomes difficult to maintain cleanliness when wounds and fissures progress, and bacteria multiply.
If you're still dating, fill a cup with 1 gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water and a squirt of unscented liquid bleach.
Soak the wooden board in the liquid for a few minutes.
The water is clean and clear, so I scoop it up with a clean paper towel to dry it.
Missing or broken dishes
It hurts to part with my favorite mug, but the exposed surface will become a new petri dish for bacteria and yeast.
The cause may also be due to the fact that the lips are cut or the drink is spilled.
That's a great chance to buy a new mag!

FlashBIOS is indispensable
I bought the Ryzen 7 5800X in September and replaced it with the B550 and Tomahawk

Even if you think that the BIOS has been damaged, you can rewrite the BIOS using the FlashBIOS.

So, why don't you like foreigners? It's natural to say that it's tough when you've become used to it.
I feel like I'm not dreaming because it's happening so rarely.
Although I lived abroad for a while, I was surprised to see that Japanese people, who went abroad, were the same as those who stayed in Japan in terms of their religious tolerance.
If you see it from the European point of view, it seems that there is no such thing as pure evil.
If my friends were all European, I'd call them by their surnames, but since they're Japanese, I call them by their first names.
It's great to see my friends.
Yen is just doing what it's supposed to do, which is nothing special, but since it's an exceptional situation, it's probably best to say something now.
Because Japan is Japan, it is difficult to talk about it in Japanese.

Since I don't have the ability to understand English to the extent, I judge based on the translated text.
The translated text has a slightly alien feel to it, but it gets the job done, and it's clear what it's trying to convey, which is more than I can say for some of the levels (I've tried playing it and it's just not for me).
The translation of this level in games made overseas is often seen, and it seems that it is well translated when it is done by a small company.
People who are not native speakers of Japanese can understand the subtle nuances of the language with long-term effort.
I don't know what level you're looking for, but if Japanese people are looking for a level where they don't feel out of place, it's probably a good idea to explore other options.

Samsung Electronics integrated the CE and IM businesses as a set department, and decided on the name DX (Device eXperience), and announced it on the 12th.
Through diverse services from mobile to home appliances, the purpose is to enhance user experience (Experience).
Samsung Electronics has clarified that the newly launched DX department, which integrates the CE and IM departments, is composed of business departments from VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical devices, MX (Mobile Experience), and network.
A spokesperson for Samsung Electronics said that "this name change reflects our long-term business structure and future direction, as well as our enhanced global leadership."
In addition, products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communications equipment, of course, reflect the needs of customers. The idea of emphasizing that consumers are optimizing their experiences through service solutions has also been added.
Taking advantage of the launch of the integrated leader ship system, the strategy of building a foundation for the creation of differentiated products and services beyond the boundaries of the organization is also reflected in the name.
Samsung Electronics has already established a "Multiple Device Experience (MDE) Consortium" through which users can freely use content and services based on IoT and AI.

> They lie with their jaws open, ready to strike, only their armoured heads showing above the sand... anything that falls into their pit is impaled and dragged below.
Hanmiao caterpillar always waits for the prey with sand on the head, which is round and flat.
This is a little unnatural.
The larvae of the Hanmiao moth wait in the sand like prey that can be caught at any time, and only the round head is exposed from the sand.
It should be like that.
It is interesting.
* Referring to other documentaries
* What Ari sees
Maybe.
Putting a round helmet on top of the armoured head makes it look like "a giant dinosaur with its helmet on," so I think some of it disappears.
24 clashes in Aichi; Train driver has no illness (Television Asahi (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
In a traffic accident in which 24 vehicles collided in the city of Kamiyama, Aichi Prefecture, the driver of the trailer, which was detained and sent for examination, did not have any disease, and it was judged that the accident was caused by some carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Route 41 in Shoubei City, and 12 people were injured.
The police first caused a traffic accident and suspected the 71-year-old man of causing death by negligence. They arrested the suspect Noguchi (54) who was operating the tractor and sent him to the prosecutor's office on the morning of the 12th.
The trailer of the suspicious person continued to advance even after braking after the accident, and the suspicious person lost consciousness temporarily due to the accident, which was confirmed by the fire department.
However, according to the search and rescue officials, the cause of death is suspected to be not the illness but some carelessness.
Police are searching the home and are in the process of investigating the scene.

Kin-chan's Beef Bowl Review [Comic Issue 4] (Weekly PREMIUM NEWS) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superman Olympiad, which started in the third volume, ends here in the fourth volume!
The previous chapter, which sketched the story from the opening to the decision match, focused on only one battle, but there were many new aspects!
Review Submission for Volume 4 of "Beef Man" 5 out of 5 stars - Oginuma X (5 out of 5) ※ Super Pro Wrestling has already started before the match!
This fourth volume is a mere introduction to the final showdown between the beefy man and the masked wrestler, Robin Mask, but first and foremost, it's important to note that this is not a book that merely depicts one bout on the wrestling ring.
Starting from the imprint style, we have changed the way of fighting with each other and the training scene, but it is impossible to have a match without it.
The tense feeling that a century's worth of battles is about to begin is steadily building up in the book, and it is surely no coincidence that it mirrors the growing intensity of the reader's emotions.
And before the big decision, there's a thrilling third-place playoff between Teriyaki Man and Ramen Man.
Despite the luxury of being a contender's card, what I like is the poster that the ramen man showed me from behind the stage before the match, saying, "From now on, I'll do my best!"
And try to hit the bell.
However, there was a scene where the terrified Tamaki was stopped from taking the knife by his subordinate, who just stood there silently.
This is amazing. Both of them have already withdrawn. There is no chance to fight against each other at this conference.
But there are times when I feel like such a hypocrite.
If such a thing happens, it will be impossible to imagine a prosperous future!
It's embarrassing to admit, but it's also embarrassing to draw as a manga artist, so I'm used to it by now!
Such a fight between the two would have ended in no time at all, but the aftermath was the tears of the lunchtime ramen man.
It's not up to God how strong you are!
That's a relief.
This is already a grandiloquent metaphor for the work itself, but up until now, readers may have felt that the main character could not lose because he was the protagonist, and that he could not be defeated because he was strong.
However, when the ramen man said this, Mr. Yudetamago was stabbed by his own words.
With this one sentence, the reader says, "Isn't it just a matter of strength for Kin to knock down Robin?
What?
Well, I guess it's just as well that I can't see what's coming next, because if I did I might lose all faith in humanity. On the other hand, if you look at it from the point of view of yet another artist, Mr. Yudetamago, who forges his own chains, it's practically the same thing.
This is amazing.
This is a big point in this volume.

Winter Illumination event held in Hakuba, Nagano Prefecture (Fuji TV) - Yahoo! News
At the Aoba Yama Haboru Birejji in the center of Gobo Town, the illumination of winter, which is starting for the first time, has begun, and the garden is bathed in a nice light.

The power supply of the NAS PC stopped working.
It happened.
1.) Open the window to the east and the west.
The power is on at this time.
2.) I shut down the PC as soon as I heard the sound of a printer coming from the room.
At this point, it was considered that the movement of the fan became worse due to the low temperature (6℃).
So I tried warming up the room again.
3.) Turn it on.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp flickers for a moment and then stops immediately.
After that, there was nothing to say.
I tried to plug the power cord again, but it didn't work even for a moment.
4.) Motherboard and ATX20 pin, try to remove other parts connected with only 4 pins.
5.) There have been times in the past when PSU fans have been louder than that, so PSU is questioning if it is not a factor.
I found an ATX power supply later and tried it.
Well.

My most-used emoji is the crying face.
For contemporary people, Kanji is an indispensable communication tool.
Recently, stamps have been replaced by emoji and chat tools.
Speedy, simple, no need for a reply, and no need for thanks.
In modern communication, the soft atmosphere is valued. Therefore, emoticons are essential!
So I guess everyone is using such characters.
【See the full image】The top 10 most used emoji in 2021 The top 10 most used emoji in the world in 2021!
Positive and bright characters are ranking in.
According to Neta, 92% of the world's net population use emoticons.
One of them accounts for 5% of the total use of kanji characters!
The smiling emojis with tears in the first, third, and fifth places are very cute.
When it's funny, it's funny!
Whenever and wherever, there's no helping it... Even when you don't want to, there are fewer people who use self-deprecating humor nowadays.
People who don't use emoji even once in the top 10 are rare.
I like that style.
