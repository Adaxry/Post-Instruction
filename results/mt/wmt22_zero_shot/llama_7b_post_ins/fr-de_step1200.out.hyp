Im Angesicht des "Raz-de-Marée Omicron" setzt das Vereinigte Königreich auf die dritte Impfung
In the face of an "avalanche of Omicron" that is sweeping over the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Sunday evening a strong acceleration of the vaccination campaign, with the goal of offering a third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to all adults by the end of December.
No-one should doubt: there is a tide of Omega coming, and I fear that it may now be clear that two doses of vaccine are not enough to guarantee the level of protection we all need," Boris Johnson said in a speech broadcast on television at 8 p.m. (GMT and local time).
But the good news is that our scientists are convinced that with a third dose - a booster dose - we can all increase our level of protection.
Despite this third dose to avoid overwhelming hospitals and paralyzing the economy, Boris Johnson has announced that the goal of offering this booster shot to everyone over 18 in England will be advanced by one month.
They will now be able to benefit from this before Christmas.
The other nations of the United Kingdom (Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales) will also accelerate their vaccination programs.
To accompany this dance of combat, vaccination centres will multiply, their opening hours will be extended, soldiers will be deployed, and thousands of vaccinators will be trained, the conservative leader detailed.
Rapide Zunahme -
This solemn announcement, from Downing Street, comes a few hours after the raising of the Covid alert level due to a "rapid increase" in cases of the Omicron variant, which has led the government to announce new measures.
The total number of cases of Omicron detected in the UK has reached 3,137, an increase of 65% compared to the total of 1,898 cases recorded on Saturday, but the real number of cases would actually be much higher.
Detected in the UK only a little over two weeks ago, Omicron is expected to be the dominant variant in a few days, estimates the government
The alert level has been raised from three to four, the second highest level, which indicates that "the transmission is high" and that the pressure on health services is "high or increasing."
The first elements show that Omicron is spreading much more quickly than Delta and that the vaccine protection against the symptomatic diseases of Omicron is reduced," health officials in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland said in a joint statement.
The seriousness of Omicron "will be clearer in the next weeks," but they note there have been "already" hospitalizations due to Omicron and it is "probable" that their number "will increase rapidly."
The United Kingdom is particularly affected by the pandemic with over 146,000 deaths and some 50,000 new infections recorded every day.
Fronde der Konservativen -
In addition to the acceleration of the vaccination campaign, screening will be extended.
From Tuesday, people who have been fully vaccinated and who have tested positive for Covid-19 will be asked to take an antigen test every day for seven days.
Those who are not vaccinated must stay isolated for ten days.
These announcements come on top of other measures recently announced by Mr Johnson, including returning to working from home and introducing a health passport scheme in some places like nightclubs.
Submitted to the vote of the deputies on Tuesday, these new measures should be adopted thanks to the support of the opposition Labour Party, but Boris Johnson is exposed to the distrust of a part of his conservative camp.
Among the rebels, MP Steve Baker judged the additional restrictions "disproportionate".
He has told Sky News that like him, a score of Tory MPs will vote against the new measures.
In addition to this rebellion in his ranks, Boris Johnson is weakened by a series of scandals linked to alleged parties at Downing Street last winter, at the time when the British were supposed to limit social interactions to avoid the spread of the virus.
The most senior British official, Simon Case, is leading an internal investigation.

Avis und Erfahrungen FFS
Hallo alle,
Ich habe einen Termin mit Ihnen für eine FFS im Januar und im Sommer 2022.
Die Operationen laufen in zwei Schritten:
- die Unterseite des Gesichts (ich werde meine Zähne schleifen, den Hals anheben und die Adam-Apple schleifen)
- the rest of the face (forehead and nose): this second operation will take place at the same time as my vagina because the surgeons work very well together.
Aber da bin ich erschrocken.
The idea of having surgery scares me already.
Then, adding the unknown of the post-operative ward (pain, recovery, the gaze of others,...), it is panic.
As a result, I wanted to know if any of you had already been there and could share your experiences, feelings and other things with me?
How are the pains, the duration of the post op.
Der Warten auf das Ergebnis, etc.
Danke für Ihre Teilnahme!
How will it function in the future?
Do you receive a new reader and return the defective one later?
Frage nach einem Gemeinschaftseigentum
Hallo alle,
First of all, thank you to the contributors of this sub, which is a real treasure trove of information and has allowed me to take effective control of my finances about a year ago.
My post departs from the strict sense of personal finances and concerns a problem of becoming of a common asset.
Thank you in advance for the moderation of moving or deleting it if it has nothing to do with this part of the forum.
Mein Schwiegervater (79) ist Eigentümer:
von seiner RP ;
- on the one hand, a share in a joint ownership with his sister, with whom he has had no contact for years and with whom he is irreconcilable.
The undivided property is uninhabited, probably run-down and involved in property disputes.
It is the sister in question who has the keys and who "manages" (if we can say that).
Mein Schwiegervater hat fast keine Unterlagen in seiner Hand über diesen Besitz.
A portion of the debt may have been secured by "social aid" when their father (who died many years ago) went into a retirement home and the debt was not claimed.
We don't know if the taxes related to this property are properly paid...
After years of doing the ostrich and completely ignoring the subject, my father-in-law is starting to worry and it's causing him concern.
He would like to get rid of this burden and enjoy his old age in peace.
I try to convince him to make an appointment with a lawyer or notary to review his situation, but this simple gesture sends him back to his painful family history and his administrative phobia doesn't help him take the next step.
Ich möchte ihn nicht überstürzen.
Es erwartet nichts von diesem Gemeinschaftseigentum.
He is ready to give up his share to his sister, but that requires contacting her, getting her to accept, and getting someone to handle the transfer.
It is certain that his sister would refuse any arrangement, even in his favor.
There remains the possibility of a court-ordered division, but he is reluctant and does not see his sister, who is also elderly, being assigned in the course of a legal process that would take years.
To help him a little and "clear the ground" until he agrees to consult a professional in law, I ask for your advice on the following points:
1) In the event of the death of my father-in-law, do you know if the entirety of his succession would be blocked due to the complexity of the situation concerning the joint ownership of the property?
Can the notary organise the succession of his other assets (that is, his RP and the few assets that he owns) and isolate the case of this asset in common?
2) If the succession is necessarily global, I understand that my wife (only child of my father-in-law) would become the owner of the part of the property in common.
Could the notary, in the course of this succession, require the other co-owner to provide an inventory of the situation of the property (title deed, list of any current disputes, tax liens, etc.)?
3) Wir haben keine Verbindung mehr mit der Schwester, keine gemeinsame Bekanntschaft, nicht einmal ihre Adresse oder Telefonnummer.
Sie hat weder Kinder noch Lebensgefährten (a priori).
It's a question that may seem strange, but would we be informed by any authority if this sister were to die?
In the absence of a contrary disposition in a will, I understand that it would be... my father-in-law who would inherit his part of the jointly owned property, or my wife if he were no longer there.
Wie können wir das am besten organisieren?
Danke für Ihre Kommentare im Voraus!

Bikepacking during the hunting season
I'm going to have a few days off soon and if the weather is nice, I'd like to do a bit of bikepacking (offroad).
Since the "great crossing of xxx by bike" itineraries are rather difficult (a lot of D+), I have made my own itinerary linking Nevers to Auxerre (130 km) avoiding the roads and with the objective of doing 40 km/jour.
It's very little like it's not a signposted path, I'm expecting a lot of surprises (worn-down paths, inaccessible or even non-existent).
The only thing that gives me a bit of anxiety is the passages through the wooded areas.
Normally it should be the opposite: I love riding in the woods but because hunting season is open I have a bit of anxiety.
Above all, I am going to go through some pretty rough spots, so potentially frequented by hunters.
Haben Sie eine Meinung?
Ist es versucht worden?
Is it better to avoid wooded areas?
Is it better to avoid bikepacking altogether during hunting season?

Mammectomie dringlich in Bordeaux
Little backstory: I've been on Testo for a year now, I've been seeing a psychiatrist for 3 years and I need a mastectomy.
I went to see a plastic surgeon at the CHU, who is part of the "transgender" programme, and he explained that he was doing good work and that it was 100% reimbursed by the health insurance and the mutuals.
Horse, in order to be able to pass under his scalpel, he said (I think) that it would take two years of follow-up with a psychologist who is part of the "transgender" network.
I have three years of psychoanalysis, but not with a psychoanalyst from this programme.
To cut a long story short, the facts are rather unpleasant.
Ich bin wirklich sehr dysphorisch, meine Brust macht mir Sorgen, mentell, sozial und körperlich, bis ich wirklich nicht mehr können.
I have always been suicidal and depressive, but my chest makes me anxious as well.
Finally, it's much more complex than that, but to sum up, it's hell and it's stopping me from living my life.
I had an appointment with Dr Plarier at Charles Perrens this Thursday, an appointment I had taken 5 months ago!
I'm calling today to check that everything is okay, and I am told no, that they have tried to contact me to tell me that the meeting was moved.
Except that the secretary recorded a bad number...
In other words, the meeting is being pushed further and further, I don't know how far.
Ich brauche diese Mammectomie dringend.
I have been planning to do this for years.
So I ask you, in the best case, would you have a better way, or better doctors who could help me to start the transition to mastectomy quickly?
And in the worst case (but still conceivable) would you have private surgeons doing good work on Bordeaux?
Danke, das würde mein Leben retten.
Yes, but when you zoom in, it's impossible to fix the page, it's too big or too small and off to the right or left.

In two months there is a big chance that I will do some cycling (2*8km/day).
The road is slightly uphill for the outward journey, and slightly downhill (false flat) for the return.
Mein Körper 1,85 m - 120 kg.
I went to Dacthlon this weekend and a bike caught my eye:
ELOPS SPEED 900
My knowledge of cycling is very low, so I would appreciate some advice from people with more experience.
If you have other proposals for a bike, I am interested.

Pyrénées-Orientales: Lehrlinge im Weinbau suchen katalanische Patronen
The Apprentis d'Auteuil and the Pays de la vallée de l'Agly have just launched a "100% on-site" viticultural worker training programme in agro-ecology (bio, biodynamics).
Objective: to allow young people registered with Pôle emploi to enter the jobs market, while providing vineyard owners involved in the initiative with workers with skills tailored to their needs.
Zeugenaussagen.
Die Motivation ist da.
For a week, Argan, 26, has been making the daily trip between Perpignan and Céret by bus.
Then he cycled up the steep forest track that leads to the vigneron Michaël Georget's property.
Arrived in the department less than a year ago, the agricultural worker from the north is one of the twelve young people taking part in the Skola viti programme, which focuses on agroecology and is offered by the Apprentis d'Auteuil foundation, in partnership with the association of the Pays de la vallée de l'Agly.
I wanted to do something else than farming and get trained in agroecology, confesses Argan.
Working outside, in nature, brings me a certain well-being, a strength.
With this training, I hope to acquire enough knowledge to launch my own domain in the long term.
Since I've been at Michaël, I am at the height of happiness.
I can ask him billions of questions!
Il faut dire que Argan est tombé bien.
Car Michael Georget, whose domain (Le Temps retrouvé) is shared between the Vallespir and the Albères, is inexhaustible on agro-ecology.
And for good reason: since 2006, he has practised biodynamic culture exclusively.
This formation, it's a super project, enthuses Michaël.
On a besoin de bras !
The Skola viticulture trade school, which began on November 2 and will continue until next October, was born of a simple observation.
In our department, which has the highest unemployment rate in metropolitan France, on the one hand we have young people without training or work, and on the other hand we have winemakers who are looking for staff, and who can't find any, explains Myriam Levalois-Bazer, responsible for the project in the Pays de la vallée de l'Agly.
In addition, as part of this training, it is the winemakers themselves who choose the teaching modules so that young people acquire the skills appropriate to their needs.
80 % Insertion in Médoc
Open to 18-30 year olds registered with Pôle emploi, the training course is complete for its first edition in Catalan territory.
After a phase of pre-qualification, during which the young people are trained in the first gestures and turn from one domain to another, they will switch on 20 December to professional ten-month contracts.
In early October 2022, they will receive their certificate of qualification in viticulture and ecology. "We are still looking for winemakers for the professionalisation contracts," stresses the Apprentis d'Auteuil employment/training adviser Laszlo Sas.
For the time being, we only have nine.
Wir fehlen drei davon.
Avis aux amateurs.
In the Médoc, where the Apprentis d'Auteuil Skola project is at its third sale, the foundation reports an insertion rate of 80%.

Tipps für die Kühle in Lyon
Hallo Lyoner!
With a friend, we would like to spend a quiet afternoon in Lyon (or the surrounding area), in a green space, if possible without being glued to other people.
The idea is to be able to stretch out, chatter and smoke, to be in a little bubble but not locked in an apartment once.
We have a car but if we can avoid driving in the centre that would be great, it's a quick decision.
When talking about this, I thought of the golden head but I doubt that we can be calm and fufu?
Muss man einen Mundschutz tragen?
My research also led me to parks in Gerland or La Guillotière but it's the same, it's not the best areas to drop.

A real question of pedal (flat, semi or automatic)
I managed to puncture one of my flat pedals (the ones that come with the shoes as standard, with the cleats) on my Triban RC520 Gravel.
I must have a heavy foot, or she had suffered a previous shock.
I've done about 1,500 km in 15 months with this bike, mostly commuting (I've got mudguards and a pannier).
I've always known flat pedals, sometimes with platforms, but actually I realise that it's annoying having to "hunt" for the platform after putting my foot down (which happens a lot at peak times in our charming suburbs of Argenteuil and Saint-Denis).
I started to look at semi-automatic pedals, for all the weekend's numerous leisure outings, but I actually started to doubt: if the cleats are already driving me mad half the time, it risks being even worse with semi-automatics, always having to look for the "good" face?
As for the cycling, I'm not putting on the automatic pedals, I have less than 15 kilometres, it's traffic that limits me on 3/4 of the journey, not the shape of my quads.
Bref, as usual, I think too much and I am better at deciding.
That is why I turn to you: when do you think?
Das stimme ich zu Danke, ich werde versuchen
Ich habe versucht, aber es funktioniert immer noch nicht

Par e-reader, voulez-vous dire lecteur ?
Portulaca oleracea, der Gärdener Pourpier, ist eine jährliche Pflanze aus der Familie der Portulacacées.
It has been cultivated for centuries, and it is difficult to locate its geographical origin, because this small, prolific plant is now found all over the world, wherever there is a temperate, hot climate.
Die Ägypter konsumierten bereits vor 2000 Jahren.
Portulaca oleracea ist eine niedrige, verzweigte und niederliegende Pflanze.
From its short main stem, it develops several stems applied to the ground: its height never exceeds 30 cm and it spreads out in a rounded patch of 30 cm or so.
Die Sprossen sind leicht sukkulent und rötlich.
Ihre Blätter sind gegenüberstehend, dann manchmal alternierend an den Enden der Zweige.
Sie sind in Form einer Gabel, sitzend, dunkelgrün oder gelbgrün, dick (Succulenz), lang 15 mm.
The flowers, about 6 mm in size, grow from the axil of the leaves, singly or in groups.
They are characterized by their two irregular sepals that surround a corolla of 4 to 6 yellow petals that hold little in the flower.
Self-pollinating, these flowers are visited and pollinated by insects.
They turn into a small capsule in the shape of a top, with a hat that opens at maturity to release a large number of fine seeds.
There is a form of ornamental cabbage with golden or "blonde" leaves that is milder in taste, and whose leaves are a little wider.
From a health point of view, the garden blackberry is an excellent source of vitamins A and C as well as omega-3 acids.
Consommé in large quantities is a laxative.
His gout is sharp-sweet, acidic, with a citrus note for some.
The young leaves are eaten raw to add zest to a salad or mixed to give character and creaminess to a green salsa.
A vegetable, the garden porcupine is cooked in boiling water, steam, ragout or added to soups.
His mucilage actually thickens it.
Portulaca oleracea requires a sunny and warm position.
The ornamental pear likes to grow on a bare and worked soil.
This plant needs a well-drained soil and is particularly suited to sandy soils.
On the other hand, to obtain crispy leaves that are not too bitter, it is necessary to water the potager regularly.
That is why a wild plant may seem too strong, but a cultivated porphyry can become excellent.
It is sown in the vegetable patch from May, then regularly every 3 weeks until July.
The branches are pinched, allowing fresh young leaves to be harvested, while forcing it to branch out.
The vegetable stems can be harvested after 8 to 10 weeks.
If they are not harvested too long, the porphyry repels like a salad to be cut.
I have just installed it.

I saw Villepinte's speech, I was deceived.
Ich habe Eric auf France 2 gesehen, ich war überrumpelt.
Travelling alongside Eric Zemmour in Armenia, Philippe de Villiers confided to Le Figaro on Sunday 12 December concerning his rallying to the former polemicist.
I am a happy man, I have a peaceful retirement among laurels for the things I did in my life. I could be content with that but there is something that is an inner suffering: I have the impression that my country is dying and I don't want that, he explains to our journalist Charles Sapin.
Here, there is something stronger than all the laurels, there is the crown of thorns.
Considering that "French and European civilization" are in danger, Philippe de Villiers considers that Eric Zemmour is the only candidate who is "at the right height": "He is the only one who has discernment and courage, and who talks about civilization."
Yesterday, Philippe de Villiers officially announced his support for Eric Zemmour by joining the delegation accompanying the candidate in Armenia.
„Was er verteidigt, ist es, warum ich lebe.
That is why I suffer: "The defense of civilization," he had declared.
And Eric Zemmour added: "We have known each other all our lives, the candidate for the Élysée had reminded us. We have 30 years of common struggle behind us."
According to Philippe de Villiers, Eric Zemmour invited him to accompany him to Armenia "on Friday morning, at the last moment".
The former polemicist must return to France on Tuesday 14 December.

Hello everyone, I am in the shit.
Wirklich.
Ich bin derzeit auf Urlaub bei meinen Eltern.
Sie sind sehr nett, aber...
Sie sind tief transphob.
I had left them a little over a year ago (December 2019) and it had been catastrophic.
Immediately after I had decided to give up the idea of transitioning, I went back into my shell and didn't move until the beginning of the year.
Only there, when my father was talking to me, on my phone open on my desk, on a site talking about transgenders, he fell down.
Seriously, the discussion I had with them made me flip!
I think I convinced them that I was cis and that it had nothing to do with trans, but I'm not sure that's going to last long.
I had to come home next week to cut ties with them and start my transition MtF but I don't know at all if I won't be discovered before by my parents !!!
Very seriously, I am afraid for my life.
I don't know what they would do if they found out I was transitioning without their consent, and honestly, I don't want to know!
Ich weiß nicht mehr, was ich tun soll, helfen Sie mir bitte!
Désolé ce soir, je stoppe et je déconnecte mon compte et je déconnecte la lecture, je crois que c'est l'heure d'aller dormir, on verra demain
You have really helped me, I won't keep you bored for long, but I thought it was possible to add e-books to the e-reader #PRS_ORG#, whatever their origin.
Ich werde sehr enttäuscht sein, wenn das nicht der Fall ist.
I'm going to lay down and read the technical info, and maybe go to the #PRS_ORG# for clarification.
Danke und gute Nacht.

Kann jemand helfen, meinen Brief für eine Aufgabe zu korrigieren?
Über "Au revoir les enfants" von Lous Malle
Ich schreibe einen Aufsatz über "Au revoir les enfants" von Louis Malle und muss ein Brief von Julien, dem Hauptcharakter, an seine Mutter schreiben.
Kann jemand einen Blick auf Grammatikfehler und so weiter werfen?
Liebenswerte Mutter
Es ist gut, von dir zu hören.
A lot has happened since my departure.
Ich habe einen neuen Freund gefunden.
Sein Name ist Jean Bonnet.
At first, I didn't like it.
I was very jealous because he plays the piano much better than me and he is also very intelligent.
Aber es schien ein wenig bizarre.
What I had not realized is that he is a Jew.
Bonnet and other students are hidden in the college because they are persecuted by the Germans.
Ich habe beschlossen, es nicht zu sagen.
I don't understand why people have something against Jews.
Bonnet und ich haben viel gemeinsam.
Wir alle lieben die Literatur, wir spielen das Klavier zusammen und wir machen auch unsere Aufgaben zusammen.
Es ist ein guter Freund.
But I am well and out of danger.
I promise to avoid trouble and do as Père Jean says.
Küsse Julien

I don't see reinitialization of factory parameters, but reinitializing your reader.
Is it the same thing?
I borrowed two books from the municipal library, as I do regularly.
When I try to read on my e-reader, a message appears telling me "Your e-reader is not authorized to open this book."

The series of the week: "Schitt's Creek", millionaires among the "rednecks"
Ich bin pleite.
John, you're taking away every little pleasure I've earned," Moira shrieks as the state takes it all.
Small pleasures, the matriarch of the very wealthy Rose family has been able to indulge in many of them over the course of her life, until the money manager went to the Cayman Islands to dodge his taxes and left them penniless.
Au revoir, the palace and its marble staircase, the jewellery, the Florentine eggs and the bags from the big brands.
Miracle: they still have a city that the father bought in 1991 for his son's birthday.
Problem: It was a joke.
Schitt's Creek is a ramshackle town in the back of beyond in America and the Rose family arrive at a run-down motel.
The plumbing is leaky, the rooms smell like "a gym bag" and the mattresses are infested with bedbugs.
Ein Albtraum und ein Zeitlupentag, den man nur genießen kann.
Eine feine Handschrift
Auf der anderen Seite sind es die vier Mitglieder des Clans Rose.
Die Eltern (Moira und Johnny) und die Kinder (David und Alexis) sind väterlich, hypocritisch, egoistisch, snobisch, unhöflich, oberflächlich und, ohne Überraschung, extrem einsam.
From the other, the inhabitants of Schitt's Creek are archetypes of deep America.
The "rednecks" (fortunately not all of them) who wear lumberjack shirts, drive pick-ups, go hunting on Sunday, eat "ribs," "cheese balls," and drink liters of beer from the hose.
Eugene Levy (father of Jim in the American Pie films) and his son Dan have deliberately pushed the clichés (rich/poor, townspeople/countryside) to offer this excellent Canadian series, which is blocked, coarse but not vulgar, thanks to a fine writing that is full of references.
The punchline of the son and his mimics always works.
Casting fünf Sterne
Die vier Hauptdarsteller sind ausgezeichnet.
Starting with Catherine O'Hara, impeccable in the role of Moira, actress on the decline, ex-star of a bad soap.
Among the "natives," Chris Elliott, the "weird" mayor of Schitt's Creek, excels in a role as a psychopath, as he had already done in the film Mary at All Costs.
One can therefore only advise you to read this fiction to brighten up a gloomy start to winter.
The jurors of the Emmy Awards and the Golden Globes did not make a mistake when awarding the title of best comedy series in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
The first three seasons are available, the last three will follow.

Your cleaning / maintenance products, tips.
Hallo alle.
I'm approaching 400km in 15 outings, I don't know exactly when to do the chain and transmission maintenance/cleaning but it's time to start taking it seriously before I drag it out too much... the bike hasn't been on the ground, mud or sand but I feel like it's not as good as when it left the store.
I count on investing in the long term, with sustainable tools/products, if possible ecological and biodegradable, I recover the dirty water, and I think to involve the children (on some things), if there is also a family/friend alternative 1L-5L or other economical.
I would go to Leroy Merlin, MrBricolage, etc. but before making a fool of myself...
Could you recommend some cleaning / maintenance products?

• The gender associations that you choose may be accompanied by legal aid.
I found "Infos Escroqueries" on a government website.
Ich werde das aufdecken.
• If you contest the transfer, the banks must bring evidence that the transfer was requested by your mother.
And contrary to what is usually said, your mother is not to blame.
If it goes your way, it's the bank that has to refund you.
How do we establish that it was she who made the transfer or not?
Can we ask to verify the IP address used for the transaction + the User Agent of the browser?
Because I am certain that with these elements one could prove that it was not her who made the transfer.
• The delay in blocking the account was normal, but the bank should have monitored suspicious transactions and did not do so.
They sent him away because they said "she had not scheduled a meeting with her adviser"
Concerning the monitoring of suspicious transactions, they told her that she had not subscribed to the security options... (I find it deplorable on the part of the bank).
• It's good that you're taking control, but don't delay contacting a legal/consumer helpline, as there is a legal time limit to act (one month or two heads of time).
Do you have specific associations / legal aid in mind?

Tiv skull from Nigeria in bronze.
Piece of more than 50 years.
The Tiv, Jukun, Chamba and Mumuye are ethnic groups that are geographically close to each other.
Gravitating around these known and recognised ethnic groups are minority ethnic groups that are geographically located in the state of Taraba, capital Jalingo.
Before the arrival of European colonists, the Tiv were renowned for their love of working the land, with a tendency to extend their cultivated territories until they exceeded the imposed limits.
They ended up encroaching on the lands of their neighbors, the Jukun, creating tensions.
At first, a happy conciliation was found: in exchange for a part of their harvest, the Jukun accepted the inconvenience caused.
But over the years, new generations of Tiv decided "to forget" this arrangement.
Their numerical superiority allowed them to generalize the spoliation of the Jukun without further compensation.
Kämpfe brachen aus...
Another source claims that in fact, the blame lies with the Jukun who one day refused to take their share of the cereals, demanding the return of the lands before an abundant harvest season.
It was the beginning of a tribal war.
Finally, the Jukun drove the Tiv from their lands.
But the Tiv who had buried their family on Jukun land could no longer exhume the remains.
They tried to negotiate for the right to bury their dead on Jukun land, but the Jukun would not allow Tiv on their land, even to hold commemorative burial ceremonies.
Gerüchte besagten, dass die Jukun die Gräber ihrer Eltern profanierten.
Hopeless, the Tiv consulted the wise and the divine.
Tous se sont réunis et ont rêvé la révélation et la solution.
The spirits told them their parents, buried there, complained of being abandoned among their enemies, and that down in their grave they were angry with their descendants.
Coincidentally, the harvest that year was very bad because of a beginning drought, which was very unusual.
So they took the signs seriously, expecting the worst.
The Tiv people again consulted the wise men and diviners to find out what they should do to appease their parents' anger.
After another dream, the diviners ordered the entire Tiv people to make a coffin and a miniature skeleton for each of them.
We would have buried him at home after the rites that were performed for the dead, and a great funeral ceremony was organized in the market square at that time.
Here's how the idea of the skeleton statues was born among the Tiv.
And as time passed, they began to carve larger and larger skeletons.
Every era had about the same size.
Today the size has a significance and means that man is born (small skeleton), man has grown (average height) and man has lived (big height).
The coffins rot, but the statues end up being sold.
Other objects serve as supports, such as a caryatid seat, with the skulls of ancestors.
It is possible that this cult overflowed onto the Ibo who also have stylistically similar artefacts.

Bonjour, Je suis enfin parvenu à télécharger mes livres achetés à la #PRS_ORG# sur ma lecture, mais elle ne parvient pas à ouvrir les documents.

Ein kleiner Text über Sherlock Holmes.
Helfen Sie mir, es zu korrigieren.
Since I was a little girl, I have always been interested in stories of intrigue and crime.
For example, when I was a student at primary school, I watched every day on TV the adventures of Inspector Gadget.
Over time, I have met many characters like this through my passion for reading and cinema.
Without a doubt, my favorite is Sherlock Holmes, written by the English author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
Er ist der Protagonist in mehreren Romanen und Geschichten.
Sein Körperbau wird als kräftig und schlank beschrieben.
But what defines him most is his singular personality: he is truly intelligent and inventive, as well as cold and ironical.
My method for solving mysteries consists of talking to witnesses and investigating the circumstances of each case.
In addition, he has the help of a partner, Dr. Watson.
I believe this character is the most famous fictional detective in the world.
I'm happy it can be found in all media because I love her analyses and interactions with the rest of the characters.
Usages: cables for winches, capstans, windlasses, winches, batteries, cars, trucks, caravans, camping cars, sound systems, electric cupboards, welding posts, voltage converters, tensioners, starting cables, hi-fi etc.
The announcement concerns only the length, the section and the color of the cable of the announcement.
Before any order, see the explanation on the photo between a section in mm2 and a diameter in mm, because a foot with a coupler gives dimensions in mm and not in mm2, so to calculate the section of a cable, use the formula: Diameter of copper with a foot with a coupler in mm Xpar3.14 = the section in mm2
The cable sections available are 6mm2, 10mm2, 16mm2, 25mm2, 35mm2 and 50mm2, 70mm2. Standard announcements are made for the following lengths: 1.2.3.4.5, 6.7.8.9.10 meters, 12m, 15m, and 20 meters, in black, in red, in double black and red and 6 and 16mm2 in green yellow.
Wir sind auf alle Anfragen wie:
- Möglichkeit, Sektionen, Längen und Farben zu mischen
- Möglichkeit, entsprechende Längen von Kabeln zu bestellen (Grundsatz der Drei für den Preis)
-Wir verlangen keine Entlohnung für Maßnahmen zur Länge
- Possibility of having cables equipped with serrated holes of 6 or 8 or 10 or 12 From one manufacturer to another, the external diameter of the cable can vary, but the section of copper will never vary Don't hesitate to contact us for a quote for made-to-measure, if our quote is OK we will create a special advert for you.
For those who have doubts about the section of the cable for a 12 or 24-volt device, possibility to send you an Excel file by e-mail for the calculation of the section of the cable according to the length of the cables and the power in watts of the winch or the hoist (in order to do this, please send us your e-mail address to send the file) or otherwise, we will communicate the power of your appliance or its amperage in operation, the voltage of 12 or 24 volts, and the length of the cable including the return and we will calculate the section of the cables.
We handle orders during the day (excluding weekends and holidays).
In case of payment by cheque, or bank transfer, the parcel will not be sent until the amount of the purchase has been validated on our account (In this case, count between 2 and 4 days for bank operations).

Wettervorhersage
I recently started cycling for almost all of my weekly journeys (vélotaff, town trips, sport, etc...) and I firstly wanted to say that this sub has helped me a lot in choosing my equipment and adopting good practices, so thank you very much!
To put the context of my future question: I live on the outskirts of the Rennes agglomeration (which is important) and I do about a hundred kilometres a week for all my various trips.
If I have succeeded in equipping myself to brave the vagaries of the Breton weather and time of day, I have not succeeded in finding a relatively reliable weather app for my location.
In fact, I am a keen user of Windguru (which is very effective) but I cannot specify my exact location as this requires the pro version (around €20 per year).
Since it is quite well equipped, it is not more annoying than usual, but I am quite fussy and like to know in advance how to plan my day.
My question is this: Have you got any apps or websites of this type, free, that are also reliable?
I will try to avoid spending this amount annually.
Danke für Ihre Antworten!
Umzug nach Lyon?
Ich komme, weil ich darüber nachdenke, nach Lyon zu kommen.
Here is my situation: young graduate, single, working as an IT engineer, I take home around €1,900 per month after tax and other contributions.
At the moment I live in Saint Étienne (yes, go there, throw rocks) and therefore I have a ridiculously low rent (around 400 for a 60m2), the thing is that my box moved from Perrache to Saint Priest... So the time of transport is considerably prolonged...
So I said to myself that it's the opportunity to "re-evaluate" my choices.
And one of the options is to move to Lyon (the other is to take the car for a 50-minute to 1-hour journey, after which I have 50% remote work... )
Daher wollte ich wissen, welchen Zustand das Immobilien ist und ob meine Situation es mir ermöglicht, angemessen zu leben?
In a not-too-small apartment (I'd like 35-40m2).
What do you think of my situation, are there areas to avoid?
Give me some advice?
It is readable on my smartphone, I see the cover on my e-reader but it doesn't open.

Die allgemeine Schlägerei zwischen den Spielern des Standard und Antwerp
The tension is mounting at the Bosuil.
While the referee blew the half-time whistle, Abdoulaye Seck literally threw himself on Selim Amallah.
On the images, one sees the Moroccan discussing with Bjorn Engels.
Then the Senegalese got angry and started a general fight.
Which resulted in a red card for the Antwerp player and a yellow card for the Standard winger.
At half-time, Vincenzo Ciuro, present on the Eleven Sports set, had a few answers.
According to the match delegate, racist insults caused the altercation.
Facts to be taken into account until the arbitrator has expressed himself on the subject.
Transgenre binaire.
Eine Übergangsphase?
One of the most common things among trans people is the transition.
But the transition, generally, has an end.
Taking up the concept of liminality (the phase between the loss of an old status and the acquisition of a new status), the transition can be considered liminal.
When one is interested in certain trans identifications, terms like women/men or women/men trans appear.
At this level of identification, it appears that some people no longer consider themselves trans.
Was also fraglich macht.
If transition can be envisaged as a preliminary phase, trans identity can also be envisaged as preliminary.
If the passing is good, and the trans identity is not perceived, then we will be read as cisgender.
Wir erhalten also unser neues Statut.
So, I asked myself.
Do you think being trans is a phase, or that we remain trans even after our transition?

Bonjour everyone, we are now in the Stockholm archipelago - perhaps our best natural wonder.
Just like Alva showed, there are several boats in the city center that could take you here.
Of course, as you can see, this place is beautiful.
There are a lot of islands and during the winter, when it snows, it is really a winter wonderland.
However, the aesthetic is not the only thing the archipelago has to offer.
It also offers the possibility to do a lot of activities.
For example, when there is wind, you can do some sailing.
Und einen Tag ohne Wind?
Keine Probleme.
Man kann vielmehr bronzieren auf einer Strand.
I mean that the archipelago of Stockholm is a place where the word boring doesn't exist.
And the Swedes agree.
Or maybe that's what I think because the Stockholm archipelago has quickly become our most popular destination.
I am almost sure that you, just like the Swedes, would be happy to visit this place.
The archipelago really has a rich history.
For example, it was painted by Olaus Magnusson in 1555.
What one of the greatest Swedish artists has painted this place is a symbol for the great cultural and historical importance of the Stockholm archipelago.
A military base was built in the archipelago.
This building was the beginning of the military era of our archipelago - an era that continues to this day.
In conclusion, this place has great cultural and military significance in the history of our capital.
The future of the archipelago is, just like its history, very interesting.
To begin with, many scientists believe that climate change and overfishing will destroy ecosystems and make the archipelago less aesthetic.
It is really possible, so I hope you, and your compatriots, will appreciate this natural wonder while it lasts.
Vielen Dank für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit.
Auf Wiedersehen in Stockholm!
Ich habe meine Kreditkarte aktualisiert.
Ich habe versucht, ein Buch zu kaufen, und immer das gleiche Problem.
Meine Entschuldigungen für die Großbuchstaben.

The manipulation of history, a danger for peace
Five years after two resolutions voted by Unesco (15 April and 18 October 2016) concealing the historical and religious link between the Jewish people and the Temple Mount in Jerusalem with its Western Wall, it is the UN this time that is taking up this form of negationism.
On 1 December 2021, the General Assembly of the United Nations voted in favour of a resolution entitled "Jerusalem" initiated by the Palestinian Authority and various Arab states.
This text carries an attack on Israel's policies, based on a rewriting of religious history.
What is particularly shocking is the will to make this place, as in 2016, a site exclusively Islamic.
The Mount of the Temple is also the most sacred place in Judaism, where the Temple built by Herod and destroyed in 70 was located.
The UN text indeed calls for "maintaining the historical status quo of the esplanade of the Mosques, verbally and in practice"; the English text is even more explicit since it uses the Arabic name Haram Al-Charif, "the Noble Sanctuary", which gives a clearly religious connotation, only retaining the Muslim name of the place.
In fact, it is the third holy place in Islam after Mecca and Medina.
And we insist, by specifying "in Word", i.e. in the use of the name.
The name given to this place by the Jews and Christians, namely the Mount of the Temple, is excluded.
Bizarrely, the French text uses the term "esplanade des Mosquées", a very common expression in France.
This variation in nomenclature can make one think of a certain hesitancy on the part of the author, but the English version is the most important, because it is the most widespread.
It is a negationist reading of history that seeks to exclude Judaism - but also Christianity, for in this place Jesus prayed and taught - to reserve it to Islam alone.
We see the instrumentalisation of religion by Arab states hostile to Israel, and the manipulation of history with the aim of erasing from this crucial place the Jewish and Christian memories.
It is a bad blow for peace, for just this place of triple sanctity for the three monotheistic religions should be thought of as a place of mutual respect and dialogue.
It is the only place in the world where these religions come together, where Judaism, Christianity and Islam live closest to each other.
Instead of measuring the complexity and the opportunity it could represent for moving forward on the path to peace, the UN resolution is pouring oil on the fire, because it is a denial of justice and intelligence.
It is a slap in the face for the Jewish people.
As Richard Prasquier, winner of the AJCF prize in 2015, said, "the disappearance of the term Temple Mount is not a harmless linguistic dispute."
It is an attempt to manipulate history, which is fraught with danger for peace.
That is why the Jewish-Christian friendship in France is expressing its indignation at such a manoeuvre.
This indignation also concerns the behavior of France, which voted for this resolution.
It was acquired with 129 votes in its favor; 11 states voted against, 31 abstained.
France is one of the countries that have supported the resolution.
During a visit to Vichy, the President of the Republic, Emmanuel Macron, praised history when it tells the truth, and he condemned any form of manipulation and rewrite according to partisan interests.
Nevertheless, France, at the United Nations, not only did not oppose such a move, but it contributed to it by its vote.
It is incomprehensible; it adds to the disarray of French Jews confronted with ever more aggressive antisemitism.

Ich möchte mir ein Fahrrad kaufen, aber ich weiß nicht, welchen Typ und welchen Budget anvisieren
Hallo alle,
I would like to buy a bike for short trips (average of 5-6 km) in town (and very rarely in the country, but 1 or 2 times a year).
It's for small trips, like going to the sports stadium or the shopping centre.
I'm not looking for an expensive or high-end bike, I just need something that will serve its purpose.
In the ideal world I would like the bike to be manoeuvrable (it will be stored in the cellar behind my girlfriend's VAE, which she uses every day) so as light as possible.
I don't know which bike to go for: city bike (but they are quite heavy aren't they?), road/cycling bike (light but expensive?), mountain bike/hybrid?
And in addition, I don't know to which budget I should turn knowing that I am looking for second-hand to lower the price.
Instinctively and without being too informed about the prices, I would say around 150 euros.
Ist es zu wenig?
Danke im Voraus,
Que des livres en anglais.

Zugeben, dass Bob Kunde der Firma S. ist.
It only sells to its customers electronically.
Problem: Bob only has sporadic access to the internet and cannot therefore check his bills as he likes.
Frage: Kann Bob von S alle seine Rechnungen per Post senden?
If yes, what to do if S refuses to send?
edit: I used the keywords "billing", "paper" on legifrance, but it does not seem to have found anything about it, the terms I used are probably too specific.
Danke für Ihre Antworten!
In total, 15 books that I no longer have access to on my e-reader.
Die vier anderen sind viel älter
Ah oui, merci, je n'avais pas regardé dans les informations de l'appareil, mais plutôt dans la section compte
The book remains unchanged for the moment, but should I delete it and redownload it?

Djebbari promises new night trains by 2030
The Minister of Transport wants to equip France with a dozen night trains, including connections to European capitals.
The government intends to launch between 2026 and 2030 several additional night trains, with new equipment that would be leased to specialist companies, and also wants to increase the number of night train connections between European metropolises, the Minister of State for Transport, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, stated on Sunday 12 December.
I want to have a dozen national night train lines by 2030, the minister specified in a message sent to the AFP.
And to cite the links between Paris and Briançon, Nice, Rodez and Albi, Latour-de-Carol, Tarbes, Bayonne and Saint-Sébastien (Spain), as well as between Paris and Perpignan, Cerbère and Barcelona, and between Paris and Toulouse, Montpellier and Marseille.
It has added the transversal connections Metz/Genève - Nice/Barcelon/Bordeaux and Bordeaux-Nice.
Some of these lines already exist, such as Paris-Nice, which was relaunched in May - Paris-Tarbes-Lourdes, relaunched on Sunday evening - or Paris-Rodez, which would be extended to Albi.
Their exploitation could be rationalised with common vehicle paths on part of the route, or not.
The choice of exploitation remains to be made, they say at the ministry.
The Prime Minister, Jean Castex, has also recently announced a relaunch of the Paris-Aurillac night train.
I want there to be more European night trains, said Jean-Baptiste Djebbari.
To create new ones, I am working on launching a call for expressions of interest in early 2022.
My ambition is for night trains to connect Paris with the capitals of Europe: Madrid, Rome, Copenhagen, and maybe even Stockholm, he specified, recalling that the Paris-Vienna service is due to be restarted on Monday and the Paris-Berlin service at the end of 2023.
We also have a project for a line that would connect Strasbourg and Luxembourg to Barcelona via Metz, Nancy, Montpellier and Perpignan, he added.
Concerning the rolling stock, "passengers want comfortable night trains, and that is normal.
The sleeping cars will therefore be back, in addition to the sleeping carriages and seats," he announced.
I will make sure that new rolling stock is developed, which will be "delivered between 2025 and 2030," stressed the minister.
It would include around 300 cars, a dozen locomotives and two workshops, an investment of "at least 800 million euros".
To finance them, the best option is for the State to call on one or more leasing companies, which will ensure the order and management of the rolling stock," he estimated.
The procedures could be launched in early 2022 for new night lines from 2026, explained Jean-Baptiste Djebbari.
I bought a book on my new #PRS_ORG (received confirmation by email) but in the section "my books" it is indicated that I have no books yet.

At the moment I am 30!
I have 5 years of experience, I am an engineer, I work in a consulting firm but in the end it is an ESN!
The professional framework is bad despite the fact that I am involved internally
- Der Lohn liegt bei rund 50k
Ich habe eine Hauptwohnung in der kleinen Kringe
It's been three years since I've been in my office, and I feel that despite my investments in internal development, there is no recognition. I remain a consultant lambda, a file number.
So I think it's time to change soon, but I have the impression that it's the same system everywhere in Paris, it's just that the salary increases.
That's where I did my research and read old posts on the subject, but in the process I'd love to have your recommendations for people who have left Paris for Geneva!
Sind Sie zufrieden?
Is there a better quality of life in Switzerland?
Do you feel a difference in mentality compared to Paris?
Are you leaving Geneva to return to Paris?

We built our second house in 2020 and had decided to put our first house up for rent, a house built in 2014.
The rent is almost identical to the monthly payments on the mortgage, and after receiving our first council tax bill after the agricultural income, we are asking a lot of questions...
We make no profit on the rental (which was to be expected) and the total tax (income + real estate) amounts to €2,100 per year.
We still have 17/18 years of credit to repay...
We live in a tourist region and could probably invest in seasonal rental properties (which would generate more taxes, but with a profit that would certainly allow us to pay them), or simply sell this house and get rid of those 2000€ in taxes...
Was denken Sie?
Was würden Sie tun?

To wait for the credit to be repaid and finally have a source of income?
Do lots of interviews to accumulate interview experience even if the roles aren't that interesting to you, so that you can do your best when a role that interests you comes along.
My first interviews were catastrophic, I specifically asked at the end for points to improve and there was one that stood out: my presentation.
Ich war zu viel in Details, die nicht nötig waren, und es dauerte länger als nötig.
I worked on it to make it clear, concise and with only useful info, at the end they congratulated me for this exercise.
It allowed me to have confidence in my speech and focus my energy on other points of the interviews.
Another point: the interviews are exchanges, it's not just the candidate who's for sale, there's also the company on the other side!
Reducing the balance of power, and even reversing it during exchanges, helps enormously.
But again, that depends on the market and I am well aware that in many places the candidate has to bend over backwards...

Magical electronic eye with double sensitivity, equipped with an LCD screen (see photos at the bottom of the text).
The simple installation of this module allows you to replace any type of circular magic eye, such as the EM34, EM4, 6AF7, etc.
It is powered solely by the tension of the filament (6.3 V alternating current) as a traditional magical eye and does not require a high voltage.
Its input impedance is very high, higher than a tube (50 MOhm), and does not introduce any disturbance to the circuit to which it is connected.
Es ist zudem mit zahlreichen Möglichkeiten und Funktionen ausgestattet, wie:
- Effektiver Frequenzmesser mit Möglichkeit, eine Frequenz von + oder - zu programmieren.
The frequency counter, for example, allows you to display the frequency of the stations received by connecting to the local oscillator of the receiver, the frequency offset will then be programmed with the intermediate frequency value.
- Ein Spannungsmeter 0 bis 800 V
The voltmeter, for example, allows you to know the value of the high voltage of the receiver.
Programmierung der Farbe und des Anzeigenmodus
The eye takes on the appearance and colours that you want: simple (without digital indications) or display of all or part of the measurement functions with two sizes of characters to choose from.
- Die Programmierung wird in der Erinnerung aufbewahrt, selbst nachdem die Versorgung abgeschnitten wurde.
The base colour is a green identical to the green of the cathode ray tube, the brightness is constant, very comfortable and does not deteriorate over time.
The connections are made by wires, an octal plug is available on request, the end of the eye can be inserted into it.

The laurel rose aphids: the yellow aphid What cultures are they present in?
Low-growing plants (such as roses, hibiscus) and vegetable plants (eggplant, beans, melon...) and laurels
Mode of action: The Coccilaure® larvae consume all stages of the aphids (winged, larvae, wingless).
They are very voracious and actively search the plants for their potential prey, then empty them of their content.
They can consume up to 100 aphids per day.
Die Weibchen können bis zu 20 Eier pro Tag legen.
In fact, the pests will be eliminated as they arise, and several generations of this cockroach can develop as long as the aphids are present.
Use: The product is to be used upon receipt.
They should not be used for prevention because they would not have enough pests to feed on.
They should not be used when there are too many aphids, it would take a large number of ladybirds to be able to eliminate them.
The larvae must be used as soon as the first aphid colony appears.
They are sent to stage L1, are practically imperceptible to the naked eye and very fragile
Mode d'emploi: Ouvrir la boîte avec prudence et déposer les larves et le pop-corn qui contiennent des larves sur la végétation.
The introduction must be made in areas of aphids, to be renewed if new areas of aphids appear. The effectiveness of the larvae is progressive.
In general, there are 1 to 3 larvae per colony of aphids (around 5 to 20 larvae / m²).
They should not be placed when there is wind.
>Content of the box: - Larvae: 1 to 9 mm long, grey, with the presence of two lateral yellow spots and one dorsal yellow spot visible from stage L3.
50 % Männchen / 50 % Weibchen.
In the boxes, the producer deliberately adds more larvae than planned.
Popcorn: Die Larven verstecken sich in den Kernen.
You may think there aren't enough worms in the box, but they are probably hidden in the popcorn.
Poudre: Nahrung für die Larven während des Transports
Mues : Sie können Mues sehen, das sind die Haut der Larven und nicht tote Larven.
Zustand: Coccilaure®.
They are available in 30, 50 or 250 larvae with food provided for transport.
The producer puts more into the box deliberately because we know that some larvae may not survive.
Hören Sie zu:
- In case of a strong infestation, clean the plant of its honeydew with black soap and introduce the ladybirds the next day.
- At the risk of parasitism by other insects from the end of June - July: use recommended from March to mid-June.
In the absence of aphids: no Coccilaure® installation.
In the presence of ants: as they feed on the honeydew of aphids, they chase the ladybirds.
To move them away before releasing the ladybirds.
- To chemical residues: do not let the larvae fall onto plants treated with a chemical insecticide for less than three weeks.
Vos guarantees live larvae: When you receive your order, if the larvae are no longer alive, we guarantee a refund of the larvae!
How to obtain the dismissal?
Please contact us via the assistance (blue and white "ASSISTANCE") on our website within 48 hours of receiving the larvae in your mailbox.

Transfer of PEA to death point
First of all, thank you for this sub that is packed with information when it comes to investments!
I would be interested in your advice on how to unblock the transfer of my PEA: after opening it this summer with LCL without really being informed about the management fees at the competition, I have finally decided to transfer it to Fortuneo at the beginning of September.
On September 30, LCL transfers the part titles of my PEA to Fortuneo.
For the species, it gets complicated: the transfer is rejected.
In fact, Fortuneo explains to me that LCL made the transfer to the wrong bank account.
I exchange with my LCL adviser at the beginning of October who firstly tells me that the transfer is validated from her side, then that the stock exchange will investigate to understand why the transfer is rejected.
In the meantime, Fortuneo sent me the coordinates to which to transfer the species.
I have forwarded the message to my adviser on Monday October 18.
Today, no news and no movement.
On the other hand, the transfer commission has been paid.
It has been three weeks since the transfer was rejected, and LCL has not taken any action, even though the cause of the rejection is known...
I don't know what to do to unblock the situation and I would like to know if some of you have had a similar experience and an idea of what would be most effective: to insist with my bank (I have sent 3 messages for information/relaunch since October 4th, the last one on October 18th which remains unanswered) or to seize the mediator of the AMF immediately?
Ou une autre option que je n'ai pas envisagée ?
Vielen Dank für Ihre Tipps!

Who will take care of the most fragile at Christmas?
The first Ségur (183 euros per month net) was awarded to hospital staff and then to Ehpad staff for their exceptional mobilisation during the Covid-19 crisis.
But she has overlooked the vast majority of the medical and social sector, which has nevertheless played an important role as a service provider for people who are just as fragile and vulnerable.
With the arrival of the fifth wave, general attention is once again focused on the Covid-19 epidemic and its successive variants.
But, in a deafening silence, another drama is being played out in the social and medical sectors.
People engaged in care work, like those they accompany, experience a continuous deterioration of living and working conditions.
With budget cuts, wage freezes, financial management that is dehumanising, in hospitals as well as in the medical social sector, the same recipes have been used for years.
The same suffering results from this: loss of sense, burn-out, absenteeism, musculoskeletal disorders for employees; closure of establishments and services, disorder that can lead up to involuntary maltreatment of people accompanied.
Die ersten Ségur de la discorde
In the spring of 2020, the spotlight was on the hospital, the Ehpad and their beds full of sick people.
Awakened by the daily concerts of applause from the population, the public power was indeed obliged to open its eyes.
A few months of "consultation" later, the reward for services rendered is announced: it is the "Ségur bonus".
Quickly, it became a prize of discord.
It is the entirety of the "care" professions that have held the first line.
During the lockdowns, everyone, from educators to doctors to maintenance agents, took risks and remained at their posts, without protection or support, by the children's, handicapped people's and elderly people's sides.
Despite the widening of the Ségur premium to overlooked caregivers obtained in the Senate as part of the examination of the Social Security financing bill, the commitment of all trades has still not been recognized.
Considered as "caregivers" to demand a vaccination pass from them, but not for salary recognition.
The first Ségur to all personnel
We see it in all the establishments that manage our departments, the prize of discord has dramatic effects.
Trained professionals resign to join eligible establishments registered with the Ségur or convert due to lack of recognition, lack of sense.
There are no more applications for jobs that have become vacant.
The rare exceptions are three days in services that are at breaking point, where you no longer have time to look after people properly.
Der File transfer scheint gut zu laufen.
I then disconnect the peripheral in a secure manner (via the device management tool).

Joe Biden beklagt "eine der schlimmsten Tornados der US-Geschichte"
Published on Saturday 11 December 2021 at 22:48
US President Joe Biden on Saturday deplored "one of the worst tornadoes in US history" after the devastation caused by a series of tornadoes in five US states.
It's a tragedy," he said, "and we still don't know the extent of the number of lives lost or the full extent of the damage," while at least 78 deaths, including more than 70 in the state of Kentucky alone, have already been recorded.

Hidalgo assured that she will participate in the popular primary no matter what
Despite the left-wing candidates' refusal to take part in a primary with her, the Mayor of Paris wants to see her initiative through, and is calling on Yannick Jadot to reconsider his position.
Anne Hidalgo persists and signs her will to participate in a primary.
The candidate of the Socialist Party for the presidential election assures, on Sunday 12 December on the JDD, that she will be, whatever happens, a candidate for the Popular Primary.
While she had initially refused to participate in this process that aims to unite the left around a single candidate in 2022, she then called on her competitors on the left to face off in a primary.
A proposal declined by Yannick Jadot (EELV),Jean-Luc Mélenchon (LFI) and Fabien Roussel (PC).
If you want to mobilise the left-wing electorate, you have to answer what they are telling us: "Unite, otherwise we won't make it," she insists, now that the left wants to be in the second round, there needs to be a primary before the first round.
The Mayor of Paris appeals to Yannick Jadot, whom she wants to face during the Popular Primary: "I invite him to continue to reflect on this, all the more so as he himself had declared that he would sign up if the number of participants exceeded 300,000 and if I was in favour of it."
Die beiden Bedingungen sind also erfüllt.
Anne Hidalgo, whose campaign is struggling to find its rhythm, assures us that she will be a candidate in this process of designating a left-wing candidate, whatever happens.
I don't care about knowing what will happen to my person, I don't care about knowing who will take over from Jean-Luc Mélenchon within La France insoumise, I don't care about knowing whether it will be the line of Yannick Jadot or that of Sandrine Rousseau within the Greens.
What matters is to be able to defend a social-democratic, republican and ecological project," she affirms.
At first reluctant to the idea of the popular primary, the Parisian councillor thinks that the initiative now opens up a space for political and media debate. "I needed to explore this within my own political family.
There was a hope to move.
There was also a risk, I took it."
Until mid-December, all citizens over 16 can still sign up to participate in the choice of a candidate.
In January 2022, a definitive list of the personalities chosen will be presented.
The system provides for a vote by majority judgment between 27 and 30 January 2022.
A method that consists of giving one's opinion on all the candidates, via a scale of mentions (excellent, very good, passable, etc.).
We gave our son a #PRS_ORG# ereader for Christmas and unfortunately, despite all our attempts, we are unable to read the transferred books.

Die Serie von mechanischen Blocs Master umfasst insgesamt 14 Modelle von Blocs.
Their design allows you to build two vehicles with manual, spring or remote control from each set.
They are blocks of construction of traditional vehicles enriched with elements that allow their transformation.
The individual sets are equipped with wheels, tracks, loaders, etc., so that they can form vehicles with different functions.
This way, a purchase brings numerous opportunities for pleasure.
The blocks develop creativity, motor skills and manual dexterity.
The collection consists of six models: motorcycle, car, police motorcycle, blue all-terrain vehicle, yellow all-terrain vehicle and police car.
By buying them in pairs, a third additional vehicle can be assembled from two sets!
- Ein sechsjähriger Junge, der sich für Fahrzeuge interessiert, aber nicht nur mit kreativer Freude spielen wird.
There's a lot more going on here: the use of coil springs allows not only to learn the principles of physics, but also to apply them in practice.
The line offers a simple conversion of a vehicle into a completely different model.
So, a truck with a swinging load can be transformed into a plane, a timber transporter into a buggy, a bulldozer into a self-propelled gun, and a shovel can also be a robot.
Die Konstruktion des Spielzeugs ermöglicht es Ihnen, zwei verschiedene Maschinen aus jedem Set zu bauen.
Inside the box, apart from several hundred blocks, there are mechanical gears easy to use and assemble thanks to which the construction of the two models and their transformation into a new toy is simple and enjoyable.
The task is facilitated by clear instructions on the image.
Such a pleasure requires great manual skills, even for a six-year-old child.
In this case, in addition to the possibility of transformation, the vehicles have gained power modules, thanks to which the small manufacturer will create its own remote-controlled vehicles.
SUV / Roadster und Sportwagen sind in der Serie verfügbar.
The range of the remote control is greater than 20 metres, which allows you to manoeuvre them freely while playing.
The blocks of this line are equipped with feeding modules and a remote control, which allows them to be built from telecommanded vehicles with a range of over 20 metres.
The mechanical gear system puts the model in motion by interacting with numerous parts.
A military vehicle off-road and a faithful reproduction of a tank are available in the series.
An eight-year-old will be able to deal with it using pictorial instructions.
Vehicle with spring training by spring allows you to learn the principles of physics in high-quality materials supports small motor skills develops manual skills.
Not suitable for children under 3 years.
Hier beginnt die Loire vulkanisch
If everyone knows the Loire and its castles, few know that the longest river in France takes its source in the Massif central.
The first vineyards are located at an altitude of Saint-Etienne (AOP Côte du Forez) and Clermont-Ferrand (AOP Cote d'Auvergne) before climbing towards Roanne (AOP Côte Roannaise), and Moulins (AOP Saint-Pourcain), this latter appellation being the largest of the four with 600 hectares of vines.
Often overlooked on wine maps, the region was nevertheless one of the first producers of wine in France a century ago.
But industrialisation and the development of the railway competed with the transportation of wine by river, and little by little the activity declined; only the most passionate winemakers remained.
The Gamay is the variety that is common to all vineyards, principally the Gamay noir à jus blanc (as in Beaujolais) but also varieties close to it, such as the Gamay Saint-Romain, the Gamay of Bouze or the Gamay d'Auvergne, planted here on soils with a basaltic or granitic predominance.

Yorbe Vertessen helped PSV take the lead in the classification
Mounted in the game, Yorbe Vertessen equalized.
The 16th day of the championship in the Netherlands was difficult for the leaders of the table.
If Feyenoord shared in Groningen (1-1) and Ajax was beaten at home by the AZ Alkmaar (1-2), the PSV Eindhoven nevertheless imposed itself 1-2 in Nimègue after a long pursuit.
Mounted in the game (65th), Yorbe Vertessen equalized (80th, 1-1) and Carlos Vinicius (90th, 1-2) signed the success of the PSV.
As a result, this one has taken the lead in the table with 37 points, one more than Ajax (2nd) and Feyenoord (3rd).
Nimègue, who opened the score by Magnus Mattsson (8th), is in 11th position (20 points).
In Spain, Betis Seville won their fourth victory in a row against Real Sociedad (4-0).
Alex Moreno (14th, 1-0) opened the score before distributing a decisive pass to Juanmi (57th, 2-0).
The rise of Adnan Januzaj (minute 62) did not stop the Verdiblancos: Nabil Fékir worsened the score (minute 66, 3-0) and Moreno offered himself a double.
With this victory, Betis (33 points) takes four points ahead of Atletico Madrid (4th), who is playing the derby against Real, and comes back to a length of the Seville FC (2nd).
Die Real Sociedad ist auf dem 5. Platz (29 Punkte).

Ich habe eine ganz einfache Frage, aber ich finde nichts auf Internet.
My company terminated my contract for incompetence on 19/07.
I have therefore registered at the employment agency and I now have to update my details.
I must declare the number of hours worked and the amount of my gross salary.
Knowing that for the period of 01/07 to 19/07 I was on paid leave (12 days).
It also appears on my payslip for a public holiday (I don't work on 14th July, a Saturday) - I'm not sure what this corresponds to, should I count it as working hours?
Also, in the gross income, I should not indicate my compensation for dismissal, right?

The rinks in Toronto are open
The Barbara Ann Scott Skate, located at College Park (College and Bay), is open daily from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
In the form of a loop, it reopened in 2019 after major renovations.
This allows skaters to train even when it is not very cold, thanks to an artificial cooling system.

Es ist ein robustes und leichtes Gepäcktaschentuch aus Cordura® rip stop mit einem hochwirksamen IR-Beschichtungsverfahren.
Son harness FUTURA favours transport and stability thanks to its adjustable features that allow each user to set it according to their morphology.
It includes the 3-litre Antidote™ reservoir.
The MP-SEC 48h exclusive to France is the result of a close collaboration between Camelbak and the French forces.
It is in Cordura® Rip stop which weighs the same as Cordura® 500D traditional, but it is 50% more resistant to tearing while also being more resistant to abrasion and traction.
The color of the bag was changed to "Camouflage Green 483", developed for the US Army and which presents numerous advantages.
A more muted (less bright than OD Green), clearer shade that blends better into a multitude of environments and closer to the green of the French CAM CE.
The infrared treatment is much more effective than the OD Green color.
Observed with the FLIR and the JVN, the difference is clearly visible.
The Velcro® is adapted to the color of the bag and the infrared treatment.
The material used is composed of a front layer for coloring and IR treatment, an intermediate layer for structure and a back layer for resistance to tearing.

Robotaxis in the UAE
The driving has been "calm" so far, without any noteworthy incidents, reports the AFP Moustapha, head of security during these trials organised by Bayanat, a subsidiary of the Group 42 company, specialising in artificial intelligence.
Four driverless vehicles, two electric and two hybrid, called TXAI, have been tested in the emirate of Abu Dhabi since November.
Customers can book a ride using an app and be picked up and dropped off at nine predetermined locations on the artificial island of Yas.
Most of our customers have ordered taxis in front of shopping centres or hotels in the last few days, explains Moustapha.
After the first phase of testing, a second will begin in the Emirati capital, with at least ten vehicles, the company said.
Robotaxis have been tested in various countries in recent years.
In November, a fleet of 67 vehicles was put into service in Beijing, but still with the presence of a security agent in case of emergency.
Passing from level L3 (where a security agent is present) to level L4 (without an agent) would be an important step, estimates Hasan al-Hosani, CEO of Bayanat, who says he is collaborating in this sense with the authorities of Abu Dhabi.
Last month, the United Arab Emirates approved a temporary licence to test self-driving cars on the roads, despite the lack of federal legislation on the matter, which is one of the biggest obstacles.
„Diese Technologie ist neu und die Regulierungen bezüglich der Sicherheit und anderer betriebstechnischer Aspekte sind in der Entwicklung“, erklärt Hosani.
Der Nachbarstaat Dubai will bis 2030 25 % des Transportvolumens ohne Fahrer erreichen, um die Kosten, die Umweltverschmutzung und die Unfälle zu reduzieren, hoffen die Behörden.
Dubai also plans to launch a small fleet of autonomous taxis by 2023, state media have indicated, and aims to have 4,000 vehicles in service by 2030.
The change should affect taxi drivers, most of whom in the UAE are Asian immigrants.

Der Casting-Chef Olivier Carbone ist tot
The former French casting director Olivier Carbone died this Friday at the age of 56 in the Monaco hospital.
Since 2015, he had retired from the world of cinema and lived in Villefranche-sur-Mer.
In the 2000s and 2010s, he was the casting director of several successful French films, such as La Môme with Marion Cotillard, which won an Oscar for Best Actress for this role.
Ou "36 Quai des Orfèvres", mit Daniel Auteuil und Gérard Depardieu.
In 2009, he worked with Quentin Tarantino for Inglourious Basterds, recruiting Christopher Waltz.
He also founded the Studio Carbone to train young actors.
In 2020, he had triggered a violent controversy by insulting actress Adèle Haenel and humorist Florence Foresti on Facebook after the César ceremony.

Waiting for Christmas, Antibes launches its light show, to be seen every evening
Que le show commence !
On Saturday evening, the square of martyrs of the resistance was illuminated in front of an audience of little and big amazed.
For 20 minutes, projectors sent Christmas balls, snowflakes and glitter on the ground and the facades of the buildings around, to the rhythm of Christmas songs.
To make the magic last, the illuminated parade "White Christmas" with its elves and fairies paraded through the streets of Old Antibes to join the Esplanade of the Fishermen's Square and the Christmas Village until January 3.
For those who missed the show, don't worry: the appointment is renewed every 20 minutes every evening between 5.30pm and 7.30pm.
It is also an opportunity to enjoy the rides set up on the Place de la Nation. And to make children wait impatiently for the arrival of the sleigh!

Le Pluglia Sonic uses a new ultrasonic transmission technology without disturbance for the animals.
The essential oils are conducted through the wick to the diffuser disc, where they are transformed into a mist composed of tiny dry droplets that will disperse into the air according to the air currents.
This diffusion is done at low temperature and without adding water so that you can benefit from all the benefits of essential oils.
Pluglia Sonic works with 3 cycles of diffusion of 4h, 8h or non-stop so that you don't have to worry.
The broadcaster is using a new ultrasonic transmission technology that does not disturb the animals.
The essential oils are conducted through the wick to the diffuser disc, where they are transformed into a mist composed of tiny dry droplets that will disperse into the air according to the air currents.
This diffusion is done at low temperature and without adding water so that you can benefit from all the benefits of essential oils.
Position : le diffuseur fonctionne dans la pleine lumière comme dans l'obscurité, en fonction du cycle choisi (4h, 8h ou continu).
When it is dark, the power of the luminescent witness decreases.
Position : when it gets dark, the diffusion stops, the luminous witness goes out and the chosen diffusion cycle (4h, 8h or non-stop) is put in "pause".
When the light is sufficient, the diffuser automatically restarts and continues its cycle.
Eigenschaften des Diffusors Pluglia Sonic
We advise you to clean your diffuser frequently to avoid clogging the distribution system, for this:
Unplug the wall outlet.
Remove the essential oil bottle.
With a cotton swab impregnated with cleaning fluid for diffusing essential oils, gently clean the top and bottom of the shiny metal disc (situated in the bottom of the output) without pressing too hard, in order to dilute possible residues of dried oils.
Remove the drops from the bottle of cleaning spray and insert a wick of essential oil diffusion.
Visser pours the bottle into the diffuser.
Rebrancher den Distributor und lassen ihn etwa 5 Minuten laufen.
As it spreads, the mop of diffusion will be cleaned and the diffuser as well.
The transmitter is now ready to be used again.
The diffusion strands are reusable.
In the case where essential oils have completely dried out inside and this alters their good functioning (even after having cleaned the wick and the diffuser as explained above),
It is recommended to soak the bristles in a mixture of denatured alcohol and water for more than an hour, stirring them occasionally, then to dry them before reusing them (the alcohol will dilute the essential oil residue and evaporate as it dries).
In an eco-responsible approach, we have developed a cleaner that is recyclable.
After use, you can recover the cleaning liquid mixed with essential oils to put it back into the initial bottle.
Even with essential oils in the cleaner, it keeps all its effectiveness.
Precautions for use of the Pluglia Sonic diffuser
Avoid diffusing essential oils that are "too thick" or "too viscous", as the diffusion would not work and you would risk saturating the diffusion mists.
Do not use synthetic fragrances.
To avoid any risk of essential oil leaks, it is imperative to use this diffuser in the vertical position, with the output directed upwards.
Never place anything above 1 metre above the diffuser.

Brncic after the victory of Liège against Patro: "My dream is to be able to play with the same intensity for 70 minutes"
The Liégeois started the match strong but gradually let up.
Without conceding to the Limbourgeois.
Drazen Brncic and his boys had almost no right to error.
After having wasted points against Francs Borains and Olympic, the Liégeois had to react in front of the Limburg leader to avoid being distanced even more by the leading teams.
And the contract was fulfilled.
Taking their opponents by the throat, D'Ostilio and his friends were able to score in the 6th minute via Nathan Rhodes.
Les Sang et Marine even went close to 2-0 but the visiting goalie miraculously saved a shot from Mouchamps (11th).
It's our best first half of the season, says the Liège coach.

Below in grey "Annuler la réparation" LAST SYNC: 16:01
Is it possible for a person to sue their own mother in order to obtain compensation for disabilities caused by their mother's behavior during their intrauterine life?
Example: A pregnant woman who is an alcoholic and whose baby is born with health problems clearly linked to her consumption of alcohol during pregnancy could the child (now an adult) sue her for compensation?
If we go further, a child born prematurely (prematurely) due to blows given to his mother during pregnancy could turn against the person who hit his mother for compensation for the damage suffered?
Ich such diese Antwort nicht für mich.
I just want to know how French legislation views intra-uterine life and the (or not) responsibility of the pregnant woman (and her relatives) for the health of her foetus.
It is this conviction in the USA of a 21-year-old woman addicted to methamphetamines that makes me ask this question.
In this case, it is likely that the state of Oklahoma seized itself to shift the blame for the miscarriage onto this poor woman, arguing that she was guilty of the "murder" of her 17-week-old foetus because she was taking methamphetamines at the time of the miscarriage...
It does not seem that an absolute link between her false pregnancy and the drugs has been established, and yet this woman will spend four years in prison (after already having spent one awaiting trial).
Ich weiß, dass es nicht die gleiche Frage ist, die ich Ihnen stelle, und ich weiß, dass Frankreich nicht die gleichen Gesetze hat.
I just wanted to share with you the source of my question.
Danke schon.
EDIT: To be even more clear on the reasons for my question, a supplementary thought.
If an adult can be sued for "negligence" during their intra-uterine life, does this mean that the law considers a foetus as a "person" towards whom the pregnant woman has obligations?
If yes, doesn't the law give right to the "pro-life" anti-abortion movement?
(It seems to be the case in Oklahoma, since this woman's conviction hinges on giving the fetus, even one that is dead, the status of a person with specific rights, including the right not to be the victim of an involuntary abortion due to, or not, to drug use.)
Otherwise, a parent should not be able to sue their child for "negligence" because, at the time of conception, they were not a person with specific rights.
Ich weiß nicht, ob ich klar bin.
Network Service Gateway Nokia Alcatel Lucent Nuage Network 7850 NSG-X
Passerelle de services réseau Alcatel lucent Nuage Networks 7850 NSG-X Services de réseau 7850 Gateway-X Nuage Networks ™
The 7850 Service Router (7850 NSG-X) is optimized for medium, large branches and corporate headquarters to ensure the required connectivity for today's SD-WAN and cloud computing environments.
Based on the most complete SDN (Software Defined Networking) solution in the market, the 7850 NSG-X seamlessly integrates into the Nuage Networks Virtualized Network Services (VNS) SD-WAN solution.
The 7850 NSG-X is used to connect WAN and remote sites to corporate data centers and cloud service providers with optimal network efficiency and centralized management through the VSP (Nuage Network Virtualized Services Platform) controller.
Die Lösung bietet mehrere Service-Szenarien, nämlich VPN-Layer 2, VPN-Layer 3 und Internet-Verbindung.
The 7850 NSG-X is one of the shape factors taken into account for the NSG component of the Nuage Networks VNS solution, joining the small office (7850 NSG-E) and virtualized (NSG-V), which takes care of the deployment as software on a client-supplied appliance virtual machine only.
The 7850 NSG-X has a single-rack footprint and can be shipped and installed in an enterprise site without requiring any networking expertise.
Because it is managed centrally, it improves the efficiency and productivity of branch operations while eliminating the need for any IT support on site.
The 7850 NSG-X is integrated using a secure start-up process that authenticates using zero or two factors depending on the model of trust of the subsidiary and the installation and security posture program.
Once started, it allows for instantaneous network capacity at the branch.
In addition, the 7850 NSG-X connects easily to any provider's (private, public or hybrid) IP/MPLS network via any access with its Gigabit (RJ-45 and SFP) WAN and 10 Gigabit Ethernet SFP + ports.
The automation capabilities of the network, based on rules, are extended transparently to the branch, which allows users to connect automatically to all applications in any cloud (public or private).
As a result, the supply and consumption of network services are greatly simplified.
In addition, several network functions can be chained in service, and using rule-based routing, traffic can be routed to one or more appliances (such as firewalls or IDS / IPS) or virtualized functions at any location before being transferred to the final destination.
For high-availability deployments, the 7850 NSG-X can be deployed in a high-availability configuration providing resiliency to the peripherals, interconnects and sub-networks.
It also takes care of the redundancy of the uplink connection for the protection of the WAN services.
The Gigabit and 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports face the LAN of the 7850 NSG-X can be used for logical and physical isolation and segmentation of users or applications in order to handle the creation of security zones aligned with the IT practices of the company.

Hallo alle,
Meine thailändische Partnerin ist MtF.
She wants to go to the Paris city hall to pledge some items, including jewelry.
The problem we encounter is that a man cannot wager "women's jewelry".
It's a rule that allows you to prevent concealment, I can understand that.
I quote the website: "Without proof of ownership, a man cannot deposit a woman's jewellery as collateral, and vice versa."
We are very annoyed because she has naturally got female jewellery but her ID card indicates "Masculin".
Title de property of jewellery in Thailand, it doesn't exist.
The person I spoke to on the phone sounded very confused and didn't give me a clear answer.
She said maybe we would accept the deposit of the jewellery.
My girlfriend and I cannot take a day off and go to Paris on a "perhaps"...
What advice can you give me on how to plead our case and, above all, what to do in the event of a refusal?
Denn ich finde das unerträglich.
Danke schon

A free recipe book to contribute to the fight against food waste on a daily basis!
After selection, the best recipe from each region of the country was selected and featured in a free digital cookbook.
It also brings together tips from neighbouring countries.
In Belgium, around 345 kilos of food are wasted per person per year, which makes our country the second worst in Europe in terms of food waste, after the Netherlands.
Worse still, 53% of food waste in Europe happens at home.
And it must be known that food waste accounts for nearly 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions!
The perfect anti-food waste council: Plan your meals by making a shopping list after checking your fridge and cupboards.
But in this book, called "Remix," there are lots of good little dishes to make with leftovers, classified by season.
Inside, for example, one will learn how to transform fish remains into curry, how to poach a few potatoes in water, or how to give second life to stale bread slices.
Here's how to make galettes from leftover homemade purée?
Zubereitungszeit: 20 Minuten.
Zutaten: 500 g Kartoffelpüree (Hausgemacht)
- 100 g Parmesan, Cheddar oder Reste von Käse gemahlen
- 1 beaten egg - 2 c. chopped fresh herbs (rosemary or chives, for example)
- 60 g Mehl (2 Tassen von 30 g) Öl - Salz und Pfeffer
- Sauce brune, Crème fraîche oder piquante Sauce (optional)
Zubereitung: 1.
In a large salad bowl, mix the cold mash, the grated cheese, the egg, the herbs, 30 g of flour, salt and pepper.
Raute ein wenig Teig aus und formt Galetten mit den Händen.
Add the rest of the flour to a shallow dish, and place the galettes on either side.
Lay a fillet of olive oil in a frying pan or a cast-iron pan and heat over a medium-high heat.
Back the pancakes until they are golden brown on both sides (about 3 minutes on each side).

Municipal elections were held yesterday in the occupied villages of Cisjordania, for two rounds - except in Gaza, where the Hamas movement, in power, refuses to hold an election as long as national elections are not called.
No legislative or presidential election has been held in the Palestinian territories in 15 years, but the last municipal elections, already boycotted by Hamas, took place in 2017.
Organised in 376 villages in the West Bank, yesterday's vote is actually taking place in only 154 locations, as no one has come forward in 60 villages and only one list of candidates has been registered in 162 others.
The polling stations opened at 7am (5am GMT) and closed at 7pm (5pm GMT).
Some 405,000 Palestinian voters were called upon to vote, according to the election commission.
These elections, whose second phase will be held next March, are considered to be devoid of risk, most of the candidates running as independents, and Hamas having refused to take part.
When I want to finalise the purchase, there are images to recognise that appear.

No 100,000 euros for the winner of Koh-Lanta: production would have proof of "clandestine dinners" between adventurers
The 20 years of Koh-Lanta are going to sign the end of the flagship game of TF1?
At all events, the gloomy affair of cheating is corrupting the image of the "legends" of this All-Stars season.
After the scandal of Teheiura's cheating was revealed in the open (he had obtained food from fishermen), here is a second case - revealed by the Parisian this week - that is shaking the celebrated game of survival.
To know that candidates have profited from lavish dinners with the Polynesian host.
The production, which had heard about the affair, even reacted in consequence.
Since a few weeks, we have received oral information that some competitors may have occasionally fed themselves by means that are not in line with the Koh-Lanta rules, responded ALP in a press release on Wednesday, indicating that the investigation will continue to find out if the facts are true.
„Bisher haben wir keine ausreichenden Beweise dafür, um diese Informationen bestätigen oder infrage zu setzen.“
And an Adventure Line Productions to continue in a spirit of equity ("and without favoritism") for each adventurer.
We have decided to carry out an investigation with the adventurers present on the set as well as in Polynesia with the locals in order to gather all the information possible on this matter, just as we did after the rumors that were circulating on the set at the time of filming and which concerned Teheiura.
Claude und Laurent sind aus dem Schweigen herausgekommen
Quickly pointed out (having "only" lost 7 kilos instead of the usual 15), Claude Dartois responded to Public.
I will not respond to this vendetta against me! he protested, calling for "proof of these accusations" to be brought forward.
If Alix thinks that the pointed candidates are "accused wrongly", Coumba does not deny the existence of these famous clandestine dinners.
As for Laurent Maistret, he also defended himself in the columns of TV MAG.
Ich schätze, dass ich 10 Kilogramm verloren habe.
It's funny when I see all these rumors saying I cheated by eating outside the game because it's me who lost the most weight and I felt it.
Nocturnal excursions captured by a camera
According to Le Figaro, production found a photo proving the presence of five adventurers during an off-limits outing.
The cheats went on foot several times to the Sunset Beach Motel on the island of Raiatea, where the animated advice was filmed, with Denis Brogniart.
A walk for a quarter of an hour on a busy road, potentially dangerous at night, to reach hosts who had served them a copious meal and promised them money after their return to Paris.
Faced with what appears to be one of the biggest scandals in the history of televised games, the final of this Tuesday 14 December evening on TF1 risks having an acid taste.
According to Le Figaro, the channel and production are considering "not designating a winner on Tuesday evening or, at the very least, not paying the 100,000 euros promised to the winner."
Did the adventurers buy their silence?
Pire, this matter of cheating would not only affect a few candidates, but all the adventurers.
In fact, those who took part in the clandestine meals would have brought food back to those who stayed behind, out of good faith or to buy their silence.
The next episode continues!

Magical electronic eye with double sensitivity, equipped with an LCD screen (see photos at the bottom of the text).
The simple installation of this module allows you to replace any type of circular magic eye, such as the EM34, EM4, 6AF7, etc.
It is powered solely by the tension of the filament (6.3 V alternating or 6 to 12 V continuous) as a traditional magical eye and does not require a high voltage.
Its input impedance is very high, higher than a tube (50 MOhm), and does not introduce any disturbance to the circuit to which it is connected.
Es ist zudem mit zahlreichen Möglichkeiten und Funktionen ausgestattet, wie:
- Effektiver Frequenzmesser mit Möglichkeit, eine Frequenz von + oder - zu programmieren.
The frequency counter, for example, allows you to display the frequency of the stations received by connecting to the local oscillator of the receiver, the frequency offset will then be programmed with the intermediate frequency value.
- Ein Spannungsmeter 0 bis 800 V
The voltmeter, for example, allows you to know the value of the high voltage of the receiver.
Programmierung der Farbe und des Anzeigenmodus
The eye takes on the appearance and colours that you want: simple (without digital indications) or display of all or part of the measurement functions with two sizes of characters to choose from.
- Die Programmierung wird in der Erinnerung aufbewahrt, selbst nachdem die Versorgung abgeschnitten wurde.
The base colour is a green identical to the green of the cathode ray tube, the brightness is constant, very comfortable and does not deteriorate over time.
The connections are made by wires, an octal plug is available on request, the end of the eye can be inserted into it.

Facturation différente de l'état des lieux
Mein Problem ähnelt dem, der nicht beantwortet wurde, daher versuche ich es erneut :)
**Die Fakten**
I have rented an apartment (25 m² habitable) and made an inventory (40 minutes).
During the state of the exit, I indicate directly the things that are not going well.
The owner makes an inventory at his own pace.
He tells me that he will have to buy a damaged piece of furniture, which I accept.
I sign the state of the premises indicating the deduction of the deposit (due to the furniture) and I give him the keys.
The next day, the owner returns to the apartment for a visit.
As a result of this visit, he sends me a message saying that the apartment is dirty and that the tap on the sink is in a bad state (photos to prove it).
He also tells me that my deposit will be deducted from the costs of cleaning and repairs.
He offers to come and clean the apartment to avoid fees (which I can't do at the moment).
I called the owner to tell him that I would pay what was in the state of the premises on departure.
Fragen:
Is a landlord allowed to charge for things that are not on the inventory?
Was würden Sie tun, wenn Sie in meinem Platz wären?

The average number of daily contaminations passes below 15,000
The average number of daily contaminations with coronavirus in Belgium has fallen below 15,000 for the first time since mid-November, according to the epidemiological figures from the Institute of Public Health Sciensano, communicated by the minister of health Frank Vandenbroucke's cabinet.
From 2 to 8 December, the average of new cases was thus 14,680 per day, a fall of 17% compared to the previous week.
During the same period, close to 700,000 tests were carried out, of which around 116,000 were positive.
The positive rate is 16.6%, stable compared to the last few days.
The number of admissions to hospital is also continuing to fall, at an average of 275 a day between 5 and 11 December.
Rationally, there are now fewer patients to be found there, with 3,283 people having been hospitalised with Covid-19 by Saturday.
Only the number of intensive care beds occupied continues its timid progression, with 840 patients found in this type of unit on Saturday, against 838 the previous day.
85th day of eruption for the volcano of La Palma in the Canaries
It has now been 85 days since lava has been erupting from the volcano on the Spanish island of La Palma in the Canary Islands archipelago, making it the longest eruption in its history since records began in the 16th century.
This volcanic eruption has destroyed numerous houses, buildings and cultivable lands.
Many residents of the island had to be evacuated, but no deaths have been reported so far.
The financial losses, for the agricultural sector and that of tourism in particular, are considerable.
Images taken on Saturday and Sunday showed the holes caused by the lava flows.
The volcano Cumbre Vieja continues to emit a strong seismic activity.

Partnerschaft kommerzieller Kleinunternehmer
With my partner, we started the micro-enterprise with the desire to create websites, as our skills complement each other.
After some research, the drafting of a commercial partnership agreement seems to be both the simplest and the most stable legally, but on some points, the information available differs:
1. Manche Quellen deuten darauf hin, dass das Partnerschaft aufrechterhalten werden könnte, was bedeutet, dass es unsere einzige Tätigkeit sein könnte, wir teilen die Kosten, die Kunden und die Räume (wir arbeiten immer von zu Hause aus).
Other sources talk of a one-off partnership, a rather vague term since no frequency or percentage of turnover produced by the partnership is indicated.
There is even a question of a de facto qualification if it is ever proven that it is our only source of income and that we share the same clients across all our contracts.
2. On the other hand, I read that it is possible to produce a single invoice per project (simpler for the client) and on the other that there must be two invoices, one for each partner.
On these two points, what is true and what is false?
Since my partner and I want to realize different projects in addition (which do not concern web development), can this then validate the commercial partnership?
And if a commercial partnership seems unrealistic, is there a solution for us to work together on common projects as micro-entrepreneurs?

Investieren in Immobilien gemeinsam
I'm trying to invest in real estate with two other people (family FYI).
We are all at the beginning of our professional lives and the objective is to start to build up savings as soon as possible, while leaving ourselves scope to realise personal projects if necessary - hence the idea of investing in several things and therefore reducing the size of this first property loan.
And even more so because the market conditions are particularly favourable for contracting one at the moment!
Doch zwei Punkte:
1. The structuring: I read that there are two main ways to invest in several: joint ownership and SCI.
Die erste scheint "einfacher, aber wenig flexibel" und die zweite "komplizierte Vorgänge, aber fiskalisch und rechtlich flexibler".
Bref, nicht viel Konkret.
Would you have any experiences to share on these two regimes, and an opinion on which seems most adapted in my case?
2. The process: having never taken out a mortgage, what is the general process?
To get the best deal, I suppose that the best choice is to go through a "broker" / comparator?
In general, would you have any advice on the key stages of an investment in property?

An old bomb defused in Berlin, 15,000 people evacuated
Published on Sunday 12 December 2021 at 20:30
On Sunday, bomb disposal officers dismantled a 250 kg bomb discovered three weeks ago during construction works on the site of a hospital - which led to the evacuation of some 15,000 people - in Berlin, the Berlin police announced.
Evacuations began on Sunday morning and involved some 15,000 people living in the Gesundbrunnen district of Berlin, in the north of the city, as well as the Jewish hospital and the Red Cross centres, within a radius of 500 metres around the site.
Some 400 policemen made door-to-door visits during the day to ensure that all residents had left their homes.
They had to insist that some people evacuate.
The police announced in the evening that the bomb had been defused successfully, allowing the residents to return to their homes.

Employees at Takeda (Lessines) give plasma to get thousands of sick people out of their "perpetual confinement"
The company Takeda and the Red Cross work hand in hand to raise awareness of plasma donation.
Every year, the Takeda company treats nearly nine million litres of plasma.
A figure that may seem huge, but which is not enough to meet the needs.
We break it down to extract immunoglobulin, a vital substance for patients with immune deficiency, explains Geoffrey Pot, head of the Lessines site at Takeda.
It takes 100 donations to treat one patient for a year.
It is our duty as a large company to do what we can to promote solidarity.
Daher haben wir "care days" eingeführt.
Days where our 1,200 employees can carry out positive actions for society.
It is also a good way to promote team building by working together outside the office.
And the plasma donation campaign fits perfectly into this framework.
Our company uses plasma as a raw material, and given the importance of the medications that are removed, we thought it was perfectly logical to get in touch with the Red Cross to set up a donation campaign for our employees.

Death due to Covid: insurance, secu and other useless things
Hallo alle,
My father recently died from Covid, which he probably contracted at work.
We are chaining the various and laborious paperwork relating to the death, but come the fun stuff relating to just Covid (yes, I say "the" Covid, I'm getting there), and I would have liked to know if you had any info about this, the questions further down.
Ein wenig Kontext doch:
- It was in a hostel for disabled people (not necessarily aware of their situation) (so no medical staff, even if it did happen that he helped with care)
- Residents have been tested positive for Covid (presumably introduced by a member of staff as they have been confined for a while)
- Einer von ihnen wollte ihm einen Kuss geben und sprang so sein Mundschutz (so wird erzählt)
- Übertragung des Covid
Positive J0, emergency at J+5, intubated in the ICU at J+7, many complications and setbacks, death at J+49.
Reconnaissance in "maladie professionnelle"
The recognition of an occupational disease would give my mother (forced into retirement due to illness) the right to compensation.
Die Krankenkasse hat ein "Online-Formular für Berufskrankheiten im Zusammenhang mit COVID-19" eingeführt, das folgende Voraussetzungen nennt:
In order for a work-related illness to be recognised, two cumulative criteria must be met: you must have been contaminated in the course of your work, and you must have required the use of oxygen therapy (supply of air enriched with oxygen) or any other form of respiratory assistance.
That's the first thing that bugs me: how can I really prove that he caught it at work?
Certainly, this "proof" is not explicitly requested.
And I doubt that his employer will give me a certificate in this sense (although I have not asked for it).
But it makes me angry and I'd like the file to be as bullet-proof as possible to have any chance of succeeding (I have enough paperwork on my plate already, so the paperwork just for the pleasure of doing it - no thanks: | )
Zusicherungen und "unfälle"
Two insurance contracts that my father had subscribed to will not apply, at least not entirely, because only the "accidental" side of the death is retained:
- The funeral insurance taken out less than a year ago, so the total amount is only payable in the event of an accident, only the premiums already paid are reimbursed (irony of fate, three weeks more and the anniversary date would have been passed, everything would have been payable...)
- Assurance of the loan of his car (loan still ongoing), which in the same way only becomes active in the event of an accident (the small print stipulates "Do not constitute accidents in the sense of the contract: diseases, ailments, bacterial or viral infections (except as a result of a wound), a natural deterioration, degenerative processes")
So I feel the carrot coming, but I would have liked to know whether the "pandemic" (and a certain general powerlessness in the face of Covid) has moved the lines in insurers' favour, whether there has been case law on this for a year now, this kind of thing: something that could justify that "the Covid is an accident".
Ich habe große Bedenken, aber ich stelle die Frage trotzdem auf.
Fragen-Bonus
In general, Covid or not, if you have in mind the necessary or useful procedures or recommendations or things to avoid, don't hesitate, if it can save me a little bit of brain time...
And more generally, take care of yourself and your loved ones, and you might avoid having to ask for help on Reddit like I did.
Danke für Ihren Einsatz.

The young men who shot at passers-by in Cannes have been referred to
We still don't really understand what was going through their heads.
How did these three "youngsters without a history", students aged 17 and 18, suddenly decide to fire a gun loaded with lead pellets at passers-by on Friday evening from the first-floor window of an apartment in Cannes, like in a vulgar computer game?
Even without being under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Following their detention, the two adults were handed over to the public prosecutor in Grasse on Sunday, while the minor was released pending further summons to appear before a juvenile court.
A priori, they will not appear before a court immediately, because it remains to be seen exactly how many victims they have made.
Eight have already demonstrated in front of the Cannes police, while the interested parties admitted to having shot at a score of people at random on the Boulevard Carnot, until their interception by law enforcement at around midnight.
One of the victims received lead just below the lips, which caused a bleeding wound.
Same for another hit on the index.
Another was hit in the shoulder.
This suggests that with the scope on their rifle, the apprentice "snipers" may have been shooting high.
Fortunately, no one seems to have been injured.

Castres lässt die Waffen auf die Harlequins fallen
Castres surrendered to the Harlequins (20-18), the reigning champions of England, who put up a fight to the end despite a changed team, on Sunday at the conclusion of the first day of the European Cup.
Trainer Pierre-Henry Broncan from Castries had assured in the week that he wanted to "honour" the European Cup, which the CO was returning after two seasons' absence, and his men made him keep his word.
His team selection, with 13 new players compared to the champions of Racing 92 the week before in the championship (25-3), seemed at odds with the speech.
Several cadres have been left to rest for the launch of this continental campaign, among them the international number eight Gaëtan Barlot, the right-handed pile Wilfrid Hounkpatin, the second-row Florent Vanverberghe or the Fijian centre Vilimoni Botitu.
Broncan, who knows rugby inside out having served in Bath's staff, has still lined up an experienced half-back pairing - Rory Kockott and Benjamin Urdapilleta - to rival that of the Harlequins, perhaps one of the best in the Premiership with Danny Care and Marcus Smith.
The young fly-half, a new pearl of the XV de la Rose, has not always sparkled on the Pierre-Fabre stadium turf, which was two-thirds full, but his ten points from the posts made the difference in a tight match.
Castres, after having made a round in defense, scored the first try by the third line Fijian Josaia Raisuqe, in the relay of his compatriot Filipo Nakosi, author of an inspired restart.
The Harlequins then took the upper hand.
First of all thanks to a try in the corner of the wing Louis Lynagh, after a beautiful pass volleyed by Care.
Then another from the back of the line, Alex Dombrandt, who burst through the Tarn defence following a tackle.
Martin Laveau, full centre behind a scrum, gave the Tarn team hope at the end of the match.
But a contentious decision by the referee on the last action will leave them rueing their luck.
With this home defeat, the European campaign of the CO, despite the defensive bonus, has already lost its wings before a very dangerous trip to the Irish province of Munster.

COVID-19: Eine Abgeordnete sitzt virtuell in der Nationalversammlung
Megan Mitton usually makes the trip to the capital of New Brunswick with her son, who was born a few months ago.
With 412 active cases of COVID-19 in this region, the doctor for the Green Party member advised her to stop going there.
To have the authority to sit virtually, Megan Mitton made an application which had to be approved by the province's chief public health physician, Dr Jennifer Russell.
In addition, all the leaders of the neo-Brunswick parties present in the Legislative Assembly had to give their agreement.
The reason I wanted to have this option, if I need it, is to make sure that I can continue to do my job, which is to represent the people of my riding, because the other option is to just stay at home and not have the option to participate, but I don't like that option, explains Megan Mitton.
Kris Austin's comments spark outrage
The leader of the New Brunswick People's Alliance, Kris Austin, is among those who had to approve Megan Mitton's request to sit remotely.
In an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, CBC, he said he approved it because it was the last week of the session.
Megan Mitton announced her pregnancy on social media on March 8, 2021, International Women's Day.
Kris Austin's comments have been strongly criticised by Megan Mitton who described them as sexist.
I found it insulting, frankly, because what he said was that there are other members who go to the assembly and do their work, she said.
I went to the assembly and I did my work during the entire session.
Assemblée virtuelle
In addition to the exception granted to the Green Party member for health reasons, Megan Mitton wants members to be able to choose to sit remotely in the future in New Brunswick.
She argues that offering a longer-term virtual option could attract more women and young parents into politics.
However, the virtual option is not preferred by all parties.
Following several outbreaks of COVID-19 in February 2021, a long debate concerning the virtual legislative works of the Assembly had created numerous debates in Fredericton.
The Minister of Education for the province, Dominic Cardy, had then declared that he would never support such a decision, affirming that the face-to-face in the political arena was a tradition of the best system of governance ever developed by mankind.
The parties had finally sat virtually for a few weeks.
In addition, Megan Mitton also regrets the lack of a parliamentary calendar.
For example, the deputies do not yet know the dates when they will sit in January 2022.

In RN, Anne Hidalgo wants to defend the values of the Republic and the primary
Anne Hidalgo, in difficulty in the polls, will be in Perpignan, RN city, on Sunday, for her second campaign rally, to "defend the Republic and its values," after her call for a left-wing primary "to continue to exist" in the face of the right and extreme right.
While many, particularly on the left, have mocked what they consider to be "a last chance" or "a lifeboat," the Socialist candidate wants to prove that she is still there and "resolute," despite polls that give her between 3 and 7 percent of voting intentions.
His call for a primary, via the Popular Primary movement, which has been arguing for a year for a single candidacy on the left, has so far been met with a big psshhh from his main competitors on the left, who have refused to take part.
But Anne Hidalgo says she is convinced they will change their minds under pressure from "the people of the left," who are "angry."
I hear the French, and in particular those on the left, who say we want this union, + we cannot be in a situation where our choice would be two candidates from the extreme right and two from the right, " she explained.
In this light, his meeting in Perpignan, where between 800 and 1,000 people are expected (with mandatory pass and mask), is "an important moment to propose another national narrative than the one that is imposed on us," explains Bourg-en-Bresse Mayor Jean-François Debat, close to the candidate.
The President of the Occitanie region, Carole Delga, at the Congress of Regions in France, in Montpellier, on September 30, 2021 (AFP - Pascal Guyot)
Coming to Perpignan is a clear choice.
It is not possible to note the violence of the media debate, its extreme-right orientation, and not have a strong speech on attachment to the values of the Republic: solidarity, tolerance, education, access to culture, equality of chances," summarizes Carole Delga, president of the Occitanie region.
When I see the state of our country, when I see the images of unimaginable violence from last weekend" (during the meeting of Eric Zemmour, ndlr), and "that a racist, xenophobe, and denier is invited to the table, openly, without anyone coming to reproach him for his profound lack of respect for our history, it makes me angry," the candidate explained on France 2.
Anne Hidalgo, who likes to repeat that she is a social democrat, in order to remind her affiliation to this family that has recorded successes in Northern Europe, Spain or even Germany, hopes finally to be more audible.
„Wir werden lange erklärt, dass die einzige Thematik die Frage nach der Einwanderung sei.
Of course it has to be treated, the question of security too, but today what is damaging our country are social injustices, it is on this that answers must be brought," she insisted.
His entourage promises a short and sharp format.
The candidate should also call on her Spanish roots to talk about the Republicans who fled to the region to escape Franco.
A PS cadre, critical, says he hopes that she will "demolish" Zemmour's arguments.
It is not enough to say that it is a puppet, he insists, referring to the candidate's statements about the far-right provocateur.
She is leading the battle of ideas, confirms Johanna Rolland, her campaign director.
The meeting takes place the day after the speech of the ecologist candidate Yannick Jadot in Laon.
And even if he has refused the idea of a primary on the left, recalling that he had "withdrawn with panache" in 2017 in favor of Benoît Hamon, there is no question of making a mistake about the enemy.
„Unser Gegner ist die Rechte und die extreme Rechte“, betont Johanna Rolland.
Will this meeting be Anne Hidalgo's last before leaving the campaign, as some are whispering?
You don't know her well, she is not the type to retire, she is prepared to retire on one condition, and that is to be beaten in an election, said the PS's first secretary, Olivier Faure, on RTL.
Der Zug ist abgefahren.
The popular primary will take place and I will participate even if Yannick Jadot does not come, she assured in the JDD, calling on the ecologist candidate to reflect.
And Anne Hidalgo is convinced that she will win the primary if it really takes place.

Hallo alle,
I'm going to move to Lyon (and finally leave Paris!) in a few weeks' time, so we're starting to think about where we're going to live.
Meine Frau und ich waren nur einige Male in Lyon als Touristen.
We know the central districts best.
Haben Sie Quartiere oder Städte in der Nähe, die Sie empfehlen könnten?
Ou inversement, des endroits à "éviter" ?
In dem Zustand habe ich geglaubt, dass im "Allgemeinen":
* The east of Lyon is to be avoided (east of Villeurbanne, Bron, Vénissieux) and a few districts of Lyon (Guillotière and Duchère)

Bundesliga: Joshua Kimmich (Bayern München) wird sich endlich impfen lassen
Joshua Kimmich finally got vaccinated against the coronavirus after testing positive, the Bayern Munich player confirmed to the public German TV channel ZDF on Sunday.
It was simply difficult for me to face my fears and my doubts, that's why I hesitated for such a long time, said Kimmich, who had long expressed his doubts about vaccination.
On Thursday last week, Bayern announced that Kimmich, 26, would not play again this year due to a "slight lung injury" after having contracted the virus at the end of November.
It had been in quarantine for a month, first as a contact case before testing positive.
He played his last match on November 6 against Fribourg.

Paternitäts-Test (im Ausland)
Hallo, ich poste hier, um mich über einen DNA-Test zu informieren.
Ich dachte mir, dass es ein Thema sein könnte, das sich juristisch klassifizieren könnte.
Not long ago, I learned that it is "possible" that my father is not my biological father.
For some context, my parents separated for a few months before the divorce, during which my mother was in a relationship with another man (they are no longer in contact).
Chronologically, it is possible that she was pregnant at that time.
But it is also possible that I am my father's biological son, because they reunited just after.
I have found services to make this approach with laboratories.
Mein Vater ist einverstanden, mit mir einen Test zu machen.
To be clear, nobody is "contesting" anyone's paternity, the idea is to do it for my mother, because she kept the secret in her chest for 20 years.
Das ändert in der Familie nichts.
I must say that I am even quite impressed by the maturity of the people concerned.
PETIT BEMOL: Ich lebe in Frankreich, und meine Eltern leben in Argentinien.
Do you think it would be more clever to use a laboratory located there (to receive the Kit and send it back) or rather the reverse (that my father does it and sends it back to France)?

Die Details der Flucht von Eric Magoni, dem gesuchten Mann Frankreichs, wurden enthüllt.
According to witnesses, he could be in Spain while the 5 billion euros are still unknown.
Last week, Eric Magoni, who was a trader at SCG and was accused by the bank of losing 5 billion euros, disappeared mysteriously during his transfer to the local prison after giving evidence.
All week, the police have refused to give any explanation.
As all of France is still talking about his escape, according to our anonymous source, he had more than one accomplice, including a policeman.
We understand that the police van transporting the most wanted man in France had a traffic accident and was hit by a black jeep.
According to witnesses, a policeman made him get out of the pickup truck and made him get into the jeep.
While the fugitive was changing vehicles, two men armed with the black jeep opened fire on the pickup truck, hitting it 12 times.
Two of the three police officers who were monitoring Magoni were found fatally wounded, while the other police officer was not found.
The young policeman on the run, called Javert, has always been thought of as Magoni's accomplice.
The black jeep was last seen on the AP-7 motorway and the police think Magoni and his accomplices have already left the country.
Es wird vermutet, dass die Polizei eine offizielle Stellungnahme abgeben und Interpol um einen internationalen Haftbefehl ersuchen wird."
Shutdown of German-Russian gas pipeline in case of "escalation" in Ukraine
The new controversial German-Russian gas pipeline Nord Stream II will not be allowed to operate in the event of a new "escalade" in Ukraine, according to a principle agreement concluded between Berlin and Washington, the head of German diplomacy stated on Sunday evening. Due to the tense security situation, "it was agreed between the Americans and the former German government" of Angela Merkel "that in case of a new escalade, this gas pipeline could not enter service," Annalena Baerbock stated on the German television channel ZDF, when Westerners fear an invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops.
The Foreign Minister, who participated over the weekend in a meeting of the G7, devoted to tensions with Russia and who will discuss the subject with her European partners on Monday, has thus specified the threats - often veiled - launched by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz concerning Nord Stream II.
The foreign minister, who took up her post last week, also recalled that the gas pipeline linking Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea "cannot be permitted at the moment, because it does not meet the rules of European energy legislation."
In November, the German energy regulators suspended the certification process for Nord Stream II - which is now complete - asking the Swiss-based consortium in charge of its operation to create a German law company.
This gas pipeline, strongly supported by the head of state of Russia, Vladimir Putin, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, by Angela Merkel in recent years, on behalf of the guarantees of supply for Europe, is very critically received by many countries.
The United States and several countries of Eastern Europe, beginning with Poland, are concerned about an excessive dependence of Europe on Russia under Putin.
In addition, Ukraine, until now one of the major transit countries for Russian gas to Europe, fears that it will pay the price for this project, which runs around it and will economically and diplomatically weaken it.
For the time being, the head of German diplomacy has called for concentrating on diplomatic efforts to defuse the tensions between Ukraine and Russia.
„Wir befinden uns derzeit in einer Phase, in der wir alles unternehmen wollen, um Gespräche wiederaufzunehmen, denn der Dialog ist der beste Weg, um eine Escalade zu vermeiden“, sagte sie.
Julian Assange has suffered a "micro-AVC" in prison, according to his fiancée
Mme Moris, the mother of two small boys fathered by Julian Assange, declared that this had occurred on October 27, on the first day of the hearing of an appeal by the United States against the refusal to extradite the founder of Wikileaks, who Washington wants to try for a massive document leak.
Julian Assange has been in a high-security prison near London for two and a half years and his arrest by the British police in April 2019 after spending seven years in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he had taken refuge while on bail.
Es muss freigelassen werden.
Jetzt", twitterte Frau Moris am Samstagabend.
The Mail on Sunday reported that Julian Assange, 50, had suffered an "ischemic transient attack", where blood supply to part of the brain is temporarily interrupted.
This caused him to suffer memory loss and signs of neurological damage, and his right eyelid drooped.
According to the newspaper, he has been taking medication.
This revelation on the state of Mr Assange's health comes after a major victory for the US in its battle to extradite the founder of WikiLeaks, the High Court canceling on Friday a first instance decision which opposed it.
Nevertheless, Julian Assange intends to lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court.
The United States accuses Mr Assange of having released, since 2010, more than 700,000 documents classified on American military and diplomatic activities, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Der südafrikanische Präsident Cyril Ramaphosa positiv auf Covid-19
Published on Sunday 12 December 2021 at 22:33
The head of state in South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday and was placed in isolation, the presidency announced.
„Der Präsident Cyril Ramaphosa erhält eine Behandlung für leichte Symptome des Covid-19, nachdem er heute positiv auf das Virus getestet wurde“, erklärte die Präsidentschaft später in der Abendzeitung in einem Statement, ohne zu bestimmen, ob es sich um das neue Variant Omicron handelt, das im vergangenen Monat in Südafrika entdeckt wurde.
There are still many unknowns about the nature of this new virus form that has many mutations, but according to the first observations of scientists, it would be more contagious.
The researchers are still working on the effectiveness of the vaccines.
In isolation in Cape Town, in the south of the country, the responsibilities of the head of state "have been delegated to Vice-President David Mabuza for the week ahead," the presidency said.
„Der Präsident fühlte sich nach dem Verlassen der offiziellen Zeremonie im Kapstadt im Gedenken an den verstorbenen ehemaligen Präsidenten Frederik de Klerk im November unwohl“, heißt es in der Mitteilung.
M. Ramaphosa participated in the morning tribute, which brought together around 200 people in a church in Cape Town.
The ceremony today took place in accordance with sanitary rules, assured the presidency, adding however that people who have been in contact with the president are invited to monitor the appearance of symptoms or to get tested.
The 69-year-old head of state, who is fully vaccinated, is being followed by the army's health services.
Cyril Ramaphosa has recently made an official visit to four countries in West Africa, during which he underwent regular tests.
A son returned to South Africa on December 8 and was tested negative.
„Der Präsident Ramaphosa will, dass seine eigene Infektion allen Einwohnern des Landes ein Warnsignal ist, dass sie sich impfen lassen und vorsichtig bleiben“, heißt es in dem Mitteilungsblatt.
The Omicron variant is now responsible for the vast majority of contaminations in the country, which has seen an exponential increase in cases since its emergence.
South Africa is officially the African country most affected by the pandemic.
The country has more than 3.1 million contaminations, including more than 90,000 deaths.
All products are sent from France and arrive quickly.
You have the possibility to return 30 days without giving a reason.
We will pay the return fees!
We send immediately on the day of payment.
In general, the parcel will be delivered in mainland France within 2-3 days.
If this takes longer, we will contact you.
Your evaluations are very important to us.
You will also receive a positive evaluation from our side after the payment.
Was ist die Tornado Alley, der Tornado-Kanal in den USA?
Wo liegt die Tornado Alley?
Generally, this Tornado Alley is associated with states a little more to the west, such as Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Iowa or Missouri.
But it can also include some areas of Texas, Colorado, Louisiana, Minnesota, and a few other bordering states, including Kentucky and Illinois.
According to the National Climatic Data Center, Illinois is actually the fifth state in the US to be hit the most between 1991 and 2010, with an average of 9.7 tornadoes per year.
In these states, construction standards are stricter than in the rest of the US.
Roofs are strengthened, as are connections between buildings and their foundations, and numerous tornado shelters are constructed near or in buildings.
There are two types: the underground shelters, situated underground or in the garden, or what is known as a "strong room", that is, a room in the house built of reinforced concrete and able to resist high winds.
Measures of protection that avoid more and more deaths every year.
Welche Bedingungen verursachen diese Tornados?
These regions are particularly exposed because they are located at the confluence of different air masses: the continental cold masses coming from the Canadian prairies, the dry air masses of the Sonora desert, and the warm, humid air masses coming from the Gulf of Mexico.
Another important factor, the reliefs of these states favour a strong variation of winds.
The encounter of these masses of air creates very unstable conditions and favors thunderstorms with a very strong vertical extension, and therefore tornadoes.
Generally, the north is the most affected in spring and summer with the rise in temperatures.
Conversely, regions in the south have a higher risk of being affected during the autumn season.
But the most central states can be affected throughout the year due to the large variations in temperatures.
