From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balsamo's age based on their interests.
From 19th-century Russian literature, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkovsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those same genteel Victorian ladies.
Psychology and the torments of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenyev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers in general are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, it's very interesting.
Maybe the roses were plush to represent a specific variety?
There are roses with such a colour and such a structure of petals, reminiscent of velvet, usually dark red or brown tones.

The Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 195x105.
The "Micropack Prestige" model: comfort and natural content.
The mattress has different firmness on each side: the medium-firm side is made of latex-coated coconut fibers and natural latex, the medium-soft side is made of natural latex.
A rubber block with 1,000 springs per square metre quickly adapts to the shape of a sleeping body, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "gamma" effect.
Among the advantages of the model are breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for air permeability, breathes naturally, like a coconut shell.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate is maintained in the bedroom.
There is also an extended warranty period for the mattress.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, but the mattress will actually last longer.
Dust and contamination are prevented by a detachable cover made from jacquard, which is supplied in the kit.
Buy a pair of orthopedic pillows for your mattress - they're recommended for supporting optimal spinal alignment while you sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides – coconut serves as an anatomical support for the spine, latex relaxes muscles.

With horror, I recall these feasts and guests in my parents' home.
Guests are standing at the door, and patties are frying on the stove, and Mom is wiping down the table.
Lord, I don't have the strength to sit at the table.
And then some more dishes to wash, the house to clean.
You drag products for a week before the holiday, two days of cleaning, and one day of cleaning after.
And what about the guests?
They are fine, and a cake is obligatory.
I don't like holidays, guests.
I even cover the table for my family.
And I'm happy to make them, I bake a lot, just for fun.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccination is unavoidable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely not enough for full protection.
This is what the head of the Association of General Practicioners, Ulrich Weigel, believes.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11.
We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in autumn," - the expert believes.
In addition, Wiegelt hopes that a fourth vaccination against the coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with a flu vaccination".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, intensified vaccination may help fight the spread of the new "Omicron" strain of coronavirus.
And the new version is especially dangerous.
For example, the probability of re-infection with "Omicron" is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, manufacturers BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide an adapted vaccine for Omikron by March 2022.
Companies point out that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that with two doses of the vaccine effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times".
This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
So a third dose is required.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the President of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzburger, advocates reducing the interval between the second and third vaccination.
In addition, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both delta and omicron variants of the coronavirus.
The experience of Israel "shows this very convincingly," the expert underlined.
Pontoon21 vibrator, Bet-A Vib, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from the Pontoon21® company.
Like the Kalikana Vib series, it differs from most other vibes in being designed with under-ice fishing in mind from the outset.
These vibes have a greater, than that of close analogues by size, specific weight, which certainly has a positive effect on the nuances of application of these interesting supplements.
Another recognizable feature is the top fin made of a strong and elastic plastic, which adds additional tones of vibration when swimming vertically and horizontally.
Bet-A-Vib demonstrates quite aggressive game when used as a "winter vibe".
Often the most effective is simple, monotonous animation, that is, movements of the masturbator up and down almost without pauses.
During planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, kelp and other obstacles that can snag.
In addition, a small deviation is effective when catching winter bream and large perch, and especially in the middle of winter, when precise and aggressive bait presentation is required.
Reaching the end of its trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly rotates and returns to its original vertical position.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for ice fishing for perch.
To suit her caprices, you can choose between two versions: with a noise-cancelling capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib lure is capable of irritating passive perch.
With the throw Bet-A-Vib demonstrates its range and accuracy.
This knot is easy to understand and not capricious, it combines well with leather and braided cords, even of large diameter.
For catching perch, roach, bream or pike, besides a uniform and actual "step", a "staircase" is sometimes used, going down to the bottom.
If you catch in snagged areas, you can change the front triple to a double, which reduces the chance of snags.
Among the primates of its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most resistant to work and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
It can be used with equal success on both relatively small and fairly deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young idlers are sitting on the shoulders of old people.

In Libya, 7,000 Russian mercenaries were announced
In Libya, there are more than 7,000 private military company (PMC) "Wagner" mercenaries.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, by the chairman of the Highest State Council of the republic, Halid al-Mishri.
There are currently over 7,000 mercenaries from the "Wagner" private military company (PMC) in Libya.
They have planes too.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 fighter jets at the Ghardabiya air base (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," - he said, quoted by the Anadolu agency.
Halid al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "bringing their man to power" in Central African Republic.
Preserve presence
In the opinion of the publication's interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "located itself in Libya."
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an air base and port in Sirte, as well as an air base in Jufra, the publication noted.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner private military company has the Kremlin's support.
Where else can there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is operating in nine countries in Africa - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection for energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, "Vagena" subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of mineral resources and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," the article says.
According to the media, the Wagner group is said to have fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and CAR.
This group is not listed in the security services, nor in the registry of legal entities, and its fighters are absent from the lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
Let us remind you that the presidents of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against "Vagener" earlier.
It is expected that the Council of the European Union will confirm this decision on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The High State Council of Libya de facto is the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions, dominated by Islamists, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single day of voting for parliamentary and presidential elections at least until February 2022.
There are less than two weeks before the elections, and the chances that they will be completed on time are rapidly decreasing, the material says.
In the meantime, the High Election Commission of Libya has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports.
Russian Foreign Policy through Russian Eyes
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures predominate.
Examples of success - "in Syria, we defended and restored peace there", "the decision on the Nord Stream-2", "the whole world was frightened by the sharp weaponry", "Crimea we took".
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine," "confrontation with Western countries," and "isolation from the world," says the study by the "Public Opinion" Foundation.
Dubai's government has fully switched to electronic document management - all government services have also become digital.
Dubai's government announced a full switch from paper-based processes to digital technologies.
All state services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This was reported by the UAE information agency WAM.
Today's day marks the beginning of a new stage of digitalization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, on Saturday.
Now the internal and external document flow in all Dubai government entities will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation has affected all without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, the police, municipal bodies, courts and so on. Many commercial structures have also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to electronic government and digitization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, as the authorities calculated, 33.6 million sheets of paper were saved, which is 1.4 million hours of human labor and $35.38 million in monetary equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens two days a year.
Well, of course, the date of birth and how many years the child has, that’s a cliche, and the class and group in the kindergarten too.
Well, I don't believe they exist.
And if there are, it's obvious that they're all in it together, including the family.
My mother, her two brothers and grandmother lived on Vladimirskaya 3, on the first floor with no grilles.
First they knocked on the door, then they knocked on the window, then they decided not to waste time and broke the window and got in, but grandpa had a baseball bat, which they got.
These people knew for sure that someone was at home...
Turkey's car production and exports fall below 2020 levels
Automobile production and exports in Turkey sharply decreased in November against the background of the devaluation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's figures for the 11 months were worse than the previous year's result, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the Association of Turkish Automotive Manufacturers.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were released from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year ago.
Some 75,900 machines were sent for export, which is 25% less than the year before.
And if in the first 10 months of this year the automotive sector in Turkey demonstrated positive dynamics compared to the previous year, then in 11 months of 2021 the output of cars was 0.3% lower than the previous year's figure.
The reason for such a fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% in relation to the dollar.
This led to a fall in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 subjects of MSB received a postponement of credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailyov told about the situation with providing preferences for small and medium business, the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform" reports.
According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of Financial Markets, in the current year, the order of the Chairman of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan from April 1, 2021, was adopted on April 9, 2021, No. 127 "On Approving the Order of Providing a Deferral of Payments on Loans to Subjects of Small and Medium Business," wrote Alikhan Smailov in his response to the deputy's inquiry.
He reminded that the order of providing a moratorium on payments on loans envisaged that banks and organizations, carrying out microfinancial activities, would provide a moratorium on payments on loans issued to MSB subjects, including IPs, from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The period of deferral ranged from 30 to 90 days, depending on the choice of the subject of MSB.
In the borrower's statement, a different period of deferral of payments could be indicated.
During the period of the moratorium on the borrower, the collection of claims and lawsuits, notification of the need to repay the overdue debt, and the collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor were suspended," the deputy prime minister noted.
For 2021, second-level banks received applications from 603 MSB borrowers to postpone payments on loans, of which 553 MSB borrowers received a postponement, to the tune of 97 billion tenge.
In the MFO, 131 entities applied for a postponement, of which a postponement was granted to 95 entities for a total of 105.8 million tenge," - concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily tolerate the "okmion" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may be able to carry it more easily than those with a strong immune response.
Pulmonologist Sergey Pushasev explained why the "okmion" strain of the coronavirus may be dangerous.
The reason lies in the conditions of the virus's emergence.
Scientists believe that "okmion" was born in the body of an infected with HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
In other words, he did not encounter any resistance from the immune system.
Thanks to this, he is more aggressive.
Because there was no response from the immune system, it became very fast.
It is possible that there are these spike proteins, thorns, more than usual, their antibodies have not been cut during mutations - pneumonologist Sergey Pushasev commented.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems could tolerate "okmion" better than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response by the body to anything, to any infection, is not always a good thing.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people 30 years old are dying and pensioners 60 years old are dying of tuberculosis.
The immune response is wild in a young person - it is completely inadequate: where you could only threaten with a finger, he hits like a gunshot at sparrows - concluded Sergey Pushasev.
The doctor also reminded that coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most dangerous one is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the first is cured very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to treat only the symptoms - and all hope is on the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, illness.
Then come the respiratory symptoms: difficult breathing, cough in the throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left, or abdominal pain, can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, the vaccination of the next generation, from 12 to 18 years old, may begin by the end of the year.
Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the laboratory of genetic engineering at the M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University, noted that this category is very actively suffering from COVID-19.
Among schoolchildren, the number of contacts is maximum.
This is the most socially active layer, as well as pupils from kindergartens - said "Moskva 24" Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the genetic engineering laboratory at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT).
Great thanks to the author of this article.

And at home, they gathered with friends to dance to their music.
Immunologists advanced a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of COVID-19
The researchers studied the fat tissue left over from bariatric surgeries and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in the fatty tissue, macrophages, also became infected, showing a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and the flu virus can hide in fatty tissue using it as a reservoir in an attempt to evade the immune system.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 can do the same.
Biologist told about causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences, Semen Goloyshkin, named the reasons for the emergence of dementia and told about the ways of its prevention in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - with time, a person has difficulty orienting even in a familiar environment.
Goloshchin noted that dementia is most often caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders, and vitamin deficiencies.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, such factors as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity can play a role," he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by harmful habits - smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, disruption of sleep and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in abstract thinking.
There is a discussion that loss of hearing may be both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its emergence," the biologist added.
The WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities requiring memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the FGUOO VO RNIMU im.

Egypt returned about 30,000 illegally exported artifacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to repatriate around 30,000 artefacts that were illegally exported from the country through the contraband route.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, by the main inspector of the department of returned antiquities at the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad, in an interview with the Al-Hayat television channel.
Since 2011, Egypt has recovered 29,300 artefacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization have been discovered in the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gaoud added that all the contraband artefacts were registered in the archives.
Currently, department staff are working on their return to Egypt.
Specifically, experts "track auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The main inspector explained that after restoration, the cultural values are exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the artefacts returned was an ancient human skeleton found in Belgium that is now part of the exhibition at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
On July 4, auction house Christie's sold a 3,000-year-old statue for $5.97 million (around 68 million rubles).
This caused displeasure in Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artefact was illegally removed from the Carnarvon Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the form of the sun god Amun, has been in a private collection and not exhibited for sale since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is not known.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of illegally exported ancient monuments from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of the contraband antiquities are the result of "black diggers" archaeological excavations.
The Crimean Tatars (232,000) are a distinct people (closely related to Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42,000 people - that's how many Tatars (from Kazan) live in Crimea (see the census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this nation consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse asks its staff for access to their personal mobile devices, Financial Times writes.
The point is that in Europe and the US, Swiss banks do not issue their staff corporate devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, a bank can monitor information on corporate devices issued to its staff as they are used for business purposes with colleagues or clients.
The bank reserves the right to check mobile devices in exceptional cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff moved to remote working, the bank wants to extend the rule to all devices used for work purposes.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management set a deadline for employees to become familiar with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Esenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of his creativity, but difficult for the poet and his "ego".
He is not a member of any literary association, he indulged in imaginism, he is himself, but he is known, in demand, sometimes rudely abused by critics, even maliciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him in their hands.
More than 60 poems were written in a year, many of them true masterpieces, the cycle of "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, and the collection "Russian Soviet" was issued.
And the main success - at the end of June, Gosizdat concluded a contract with Yessenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
No contemporary poet has been honored with such a distinction - he is the first!
Moreover, it implied very good money - the fee was 1000 roubles a month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for instance, received 300 roubles a month, the engineer - 200).
The funds were needed as never before.
Esenin married the granddaughter of Lev Tolstoy, Sofia Tolstaya, and had to arrange a family life, support his sisters Katya and Sasha, and his mother.
It seems life is getting back to normal, there is something to be happy about, but for him everything is colored in dark tones, as if the nightmare of the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) has materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is the wind blowing?
Over the empty and desolate field,
As the leaves fall in September.
Alcohol makes you stupid.
Many acquaintances noted that Yessenin looked terrible, obviously ill.
There are more and more relapses, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason, probably, is not only in alcoholism...
In fact, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was put to Sergey Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, from May 1923, when Esenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, an American, Alice Duncan, was improving his health in a Paris clinic under the professor Petr Gannushkin (Esenev will meet him again in Moscow two years later).
And there are enough testimonies of the poet's drunkenness, scandals on this ground, appeals to the police - enough for dozens of memoirs.
From the beginning of the 20s, the terrible romance of the poet with the green snake developed rapidly.
In late summer 1923, Yessenin moved in with his friend, the imaginist Ivan Starcev.
It's amazing, but Yessenin, who had very good incomes, never had his own home in either Moscow or St. Petersburg: he lived in rented flats, in hotels or with acquaintances.
Starchenko remembers:
He only came to sleep, and in most cases in a state of insanity, drunk.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Esenin fell on the staircase...
Falling, he scraped his face and whined.
When he came to, he kept coughing up blood...'
And even Esenin, after his travels around Europe and in the USA (at that time there was a dry law in the States, but Duncan smuggled a decent amount of spirits with her), admitted:
I saw nothing there but cabarets and streets...
I'm getting to the end and people stop remembering...
Well, and drank, of course...
I drank because I was homesick."

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as "weapons"
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jabłoński expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used the refugees as "a weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the deputy head of the MFA in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Jabłoński, the sanctions against Belarus have "temporarily stopped Lukashenko," but he is "actively seeking new paths."
The Polish official also believes that illegal migrants will now be used as a weapon "in many points around the world."
As the kp.ru website wrote, earlier the European Union introduced a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 physical persons and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they announced their readiness to expand restrictive measures against the republic "if the situation in the country does not improve."
In response, Minsk introduced a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had earlier decided to introduce sanctions against Belarus.

“Not a Senke hat”: when a baroque coat makes a man a laughingstock
At global events in 2021, the dominant look was the tuxedo.
Perhaps the first to declare his new fashion choice was Daniel Craig.
In September, at the premiere of the film "Not Time to Die," he appeared in a velvet mauve jacket and a traditional "Bond girl" butterfly.
Prince William has followed in his father's eco-friendly footsteps twice, first wearing an inappropriate green velvet jacket for an environmental award ceremony, and then opting for a more traditional look for a charity event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago the trend was seen in Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to pick up his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet tuxedo by Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his sons were dressed the same.
AliExpress has already noted a growing demand for silk men's jackets in Russia.
According to the analysts of the service, cited by the "Gazeta.Ru" newspaper, their number has grown by 1.4 times.
The most popular are warm velvet blazers with padding and a shapely silhouette, the main colors are dark brown, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - they choose baroque suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
There are budget options at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
This season, in the luxury segment, there are almost all the brands - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desired is the Gucci model, in which the ambassador of the brand, Jared Leto, came out at one of the premieres of the film "Gucci House".
Choosing expensive-branded jackets, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special technology of interlacing threads, a dense fabric with a wavy external texture and a smooth internal side is obtained.
More budget versions are made of cotton or polyamide, but they serve less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhshin warns that in the case of a silk jacket, the main thing is not its model or cut, but appropriateness.
A velvet jacket requires evening light so it's ideal if you're going to a party or a formal event - explains Vakhshkin. It's also suitable if the invitation mentions the dress code of "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion that allows to make a choice in favor of a baroque jacket is the status of its buyer.
“A man in a pinstriped suit, first and foremost, needs to acquire a proper navy suit with enough, - consider the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion “Handsome Bramble”. - Owners of pinstriped suits, as a rule, belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to themed parties where the dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhshin suggests combining a velvet jacket with such items as classic trousers with tassels, one-colour shirts, silk ties, cravats, and handkerchiefs.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Brammell's Beauty" are sure: it would be inappropriate for a plain-clothes officer to turn up at the corporation in a velvet jacket, but if we're talking of a "manager among those who are running this event, then - "yes," such a thing would befit him.
If you're a low-ranking employee whose goal is to move up the corporate ladder or score financial bonuses, it's best not to wear a pinstriped suit.
The editors of the Telegram-channel about men's fashion estimate that the management will assess the phrase "not like Seneka's hat" precisely.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural tone, so tired.
And it has absolutely nothing to do with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of my surroundings.
But with all my heart, I wish you success in life!
It all comes down to money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, it is paid for.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy is also not in short supply - gas, oil and coal were cheaper to buy than they are to sell now.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
The frog jumps.
And who's passing through then?
As usual - a regular buyer.
Does the sheriff care about the problems of the Indians?
So it is not right to regard Western politicians as idiots who "missed" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good mind.
I didn't see any beautiful people in the pictures.
Just mediocrity within the middle-of-the-road passenger.
Maybe if such characters are so sure of their beauty that they decide to show it off on the whole train, they will not be approached by such people.
But only because of their mental disorder and ignorance, not because of their appearance.

An immunologist said that revaccination after 4-5 months will help protect against the "omicron" strain of the coronavirus.
Revaccination after four to five months may protect against the new "omicron" strain of coronavirus infection.
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kruglov, who called six months of vaccination, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period"
Previously, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and people with chronic diseases - in four, " said the expert, calling for a parallel vaccination campaign.
Kruchkov also noted that an early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or has had the illness and been vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and had the illness, they have "hybrid immunity" - that is, antibodies and neutralization are sufficient, - the expert added.
The "Big Seven" warned Russia of "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The "Big Seven" countries (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France, and Japan) issued a statement following a meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It stresses that "military aggression" by Russia against Ukraine "will have catastrophic consequences and will cost Moscow dearly," but concrete measures are not described in the document.
"We, the ministers of foreign affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of the Russian military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement reads.
Then the ministers called on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and abide by its international obligations regarding transparency of military activities," as US President Biden said during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
We confirm our support for France and Germany's efforts in the Normandy format for the full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the foreign ministers of the "Big Seven" also stated.
The use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price to pay," they warn.
We confirm our unshakeable commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation in response to our common and all-round interests," the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss said that Russia would face "serious consequences" if it were to invade Ukraine.
According to her words, this meeting showed "a united voice of the countries of the Big Seven, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and who have made it clear that an invasion of Ukraine will have catastrophic consequences for Russia."
Pfizer vaccine deemed 32 times less effective than Omicron strain
The effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine against the Omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of illness.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology have come to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was deemed less effective based on a study of anti-viral activity in citizens who had received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
We see that most people had high levels of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but that ability was significantly reduced against the Omicron variant," Professor Malik Peiris explained.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against a severe course of the disease with a coronavirus infection.
Previously, researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the influence of the Omicron strain.
The authors of the study came to the conclusion that the Omikron strain could cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense accused Germany of blocking the supply of weapons to NATO in Kiev
Ukrainian Defense Minister, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the purchase of deadly weapons in Kiev on behalf of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times newspaper on December 12, Reschetnikov recalled that Germany had imposed a veto on the purchase of anti-sniper systems and assault rifles for the purpose of shooting down drones by Ukraine.
It is also noted that later Berlin softened its stance on machine guns, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to acquire the mentioned weaponry within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, it is about the US, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the new German government, headed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, has not yet clarified its position on the supply of weapons to Ukraine.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect weapons deliveries from Berlin while Chancellor Scholz is in office.
According to him, the previous German government explained its refusal to supply weapons by the risk of an escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite "Russia's occupation" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat believes, Germany will maintain even with a new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that Kiev was expecting help from Berlin in equipping its naval fleet.
Ukraine expects Germany to be its "partner in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the party "The Greens" of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

The foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, the final statement of the parties said.
Participants in the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of Russian armed forces on the borders of the country.
There should be no doubt in Russia that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs, the statement says.
Ministers from the G7 countries and the EU's chief representative noted that "are united in their condemnation of the Russian armed build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine."
British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it were to invade Ukraine, speaking at a press conference in Liverpool.
We have made it clear that any incursion will have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to stop aggression against Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).

Ways to return stolen money through internet stores revealed
There are several ways to get your money back from online stores that have stolen it, and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
This was revealed by experts in information security in an interview with RBC.
For example, to reduce the risk of major losses from falling into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account, which are not used for online shopping.
Some of the savings can be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend keeping a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen during purchases in stores not using the 3D Secure protection technology, you can initiate a return of funds procedure.
According to the rules established by the payment systems, responsibility for unauthorized transactions, carried out without the use of 3D Secure, is borne by the participant in the chain of payments who does not use this service," the representative of the Promsvyazbank explained.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert with international payment service provider Ecommpay, stressed that the buyer has the right to lodge a complaint with the bank for the purpose of contesting the fraudulent transaction not later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used a card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be contested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases internet stores themselves return the money to the client if the order has not yet been sent to delivery.
On November 19, member of the Public Chamber, director of the League for Safe Internet, Ekaterina Miropolina, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 cases of fraud were received: from the sale of fake documents to theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution to the current situation may be the creation of a single window for complaints about online scammers.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis over migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of Poland's judicial system, the buildup of Russian forces near Ukraine's borders, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream-2."
Although Scholz declared his desire to preserve good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would call on Scholz to oppose the "Nord Stream 2" project, under which Russian gas is to be delivered to Germany via Ukraine.
According to Moravets, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, in turn, supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve the crisis.
However, Poland's judicial system remains a source of disagreement.
The European Court fined Poland for violating EU law by introducing judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing "Law and Justice" party.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its Supreme Court ruled that national law has priority over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not take on public commitments to stop the work of the "North Stream-2" in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany on halting the gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, a high-ranking congressional official said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday about the consequences if Russia were to violate the border with Ukraine, and this position was confirmed by representatives of the "Big Seven" on Sunday.
Dmitry, look closer.
The view from the window is the same, the size of the window has not changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the room has been removed so you can see the second window.
And generally those who are not familiar with the initial layout are those who doubt.
And I know such flats very well and I can see how it was replanned.
Let them have a good time.
It always surprises me when people write about cleaning aids to get rid of barnacles on a ship's hull, toilets, skirting boards and cranes.
You see them once a year at Easter, if you're lucky, and have to wash them.
Just don't pollute.
Mincifry wants to reward writers with residencies
In the future, the state will transfer federal property inherited from the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Literary Fund of the USSR to the Support Fund for Russian Writers.
Based on this, writer's residencies will be created, the "Parliamentary Newspaper" reported in Minsk, which will be a founder of the fund.
Mincifry is preparing a presidential decree on the creation of a foundation to support Russian writers.
In the explanatory note, it is specified that the fund will be responsible for taking care, including the purposeful use and preservation of buildings and structures that belonged to the Soviet Union of Writers and the Literary Fund.
A significant number of objects of immovable property belonging to the Literary Fund of the USSR have passed into the ownership of the Russian Federation, including objects located in the village of writers in Peredelkino, the village of Komarovo in the Leningrad region and others, the press service of the Ministry of Communications reported.
The decree stipulates that the Foundation's Charter should reflect that it is "established for the purpose of supporting literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for creative work by writers."
“Creating the conditions for creative activity” means creating writer’s residencies in various regions of Russia, providing comfortable conditions for creativity, - explained in the Ministry of Culture to our publication.

Doctors warned of the danger of long-term use of blood-thinning drugs after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Iryna Yarceva and Sergey Tokarev warned of the danger of irresponsible use of blood-thinning drugs after being infected with the coronavirus Covid-19 and before being vaccinated against the coronavirus.
A doctor-therapist, immunologist Irina Yarceva told that the independent prevention of possible formation of thrombi after COVID-19 may provoke an insult.
Yarceva explained that blood-thinning drugs are not meant for everyone, only for those patients who were hospitalized, stayed in the hospital and had complications.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood-thinning drugs that prevent excessive clotting) as needed.
She said that at the moment there is hysteria - everyone drinks anticoagulants in succession and gets complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (blood in the brain).
Sergey Tokarev, the chief prophylactic doctor of the Ural Federal District, the scientific director of the Society of Specialists in Prophylactic Medicine, and a doctor of medical sciences, in an interview with URA.RU, said that Russians are currently using anticoagulants like aspirin very often, both before and after vaccination against the coronavirus infection.
According to Dr Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the internet and start to treat themselves.
There are such citizens who start taking anti-coagulants on their own decision a week before vaccination.
And before the vaccination doctors noticed bleeding.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without finding out the cause of any symptom.

The person who found money in the wall of the church will be paid $20,000
The plumber who found the money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be rewarded.
This was reported in a press release by the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident happened at the Lakewood Church in Houston, where Pastor Joel Osteen promises his congregation that they will prosper if they have enough faith.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Coyle was called to repair one of the church's toilets and found thousands of bundles of cash and cheques under the insulation.
He passed it on to the church and, he says, didn't even get thanks from Austin.
I wanted to hear him say: "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand that you did what you could do," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The discovery is believed to be linked to a theft at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
At that time, around $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks were stolen from the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, a reward of 25,000 dollars was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Coyle couldn't claim the sum as the deadline for the award had passed.
Despite that, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time put up a $5,000 reward and later received $20,000 in donations from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
Earlier, it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of the Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic as a real person.

The situation is even more serious if we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-Carnival and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in the flow of tourists," said Barroso.
Previously, the authorities in Brazil had obliged uninfected tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
Scheme of full protection from COVID-19 revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Alchevsky in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme for full protection from the coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved through the introduction of injections and the use of nasal vaccine.
When given intramuscularly, large numbers of immunoglobulin A are formed. When the vaccine is given by injection, this does not happen.
Antibodies A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the organism.
And after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulin G (antibodies).
And if you get both vaccines, you get lots of A and G immunoglobulins. But there's no decision yet on a double vaccination," - the doctor said.
Sergey Tokarev, the main prophylacticist of the Ural Federal District, a doctor of medical sciences, said that the main advantage of the nasal vaccination used together with the injection is the possibility to stop being a carrier of the COVID-19 virus.
He added that this would help as in such a case the body's defence should be maximised.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children would lead to a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, such a picture is observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Inna, hm...
I talked to my bitch (a long time ago) like this - if you're ready to exchange a warm home, feeding, love and games for a female in heat, go ahead.
But Pesel was trained and generally smart.
He chose my society and went home.
On the video, which works in 90% of cases.
Not from the ceiling, believe me.
I stopped many owners to prevent them from running after their dogs, although they apologized, saying that the dog, 200,000 rubles, took my hand and led me to the other side.
In the end, "200,000" chose the owner, not the dog, which had run away somewhere.
Mass protests against vaccination continue in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of authorities to make vaccination mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Outraged by the government's healthcare policies, Spaniards held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held placards saying "This is a false pandemic", "I will not be vaccinated".
A major protest against the sanitary passport took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a Covid-certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, sports halls, retirement homes and night-time entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was taken by the authorities of several regions of the country amid a rise in the number of cases of infection with the coronavirus.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action started peacefully but then escalated into clashes with riot police.
Demonstrators started to throw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.

WHO found "omicron" already in dozens of countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the new coronavirus "Omicron" has been detected in 63 countries.
Some experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The spread of the strain was described in a WHO report.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain had been detected in 63 countries, all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has been actively spreading since the end of November.
WHO also expressed concern about the rapid spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
Experts from the WHO expressed concern that the new strain, based on preliminary data, could outstrip the spread of the "delta" strain, which is the Indian version of the coronavirus that is currently leading in all absolutely countries without exception.
Previously, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the Omicron strain could significantly influence the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
This conclusion was also drawn in Great Britain.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "Omicron" will replace "Delta" in the coming months.
And the number of cases in the UK alone is expected to reach 1 million, although officially the "omnicom" is currently suffering from a few hundred people in the UK, and up to 10,000 according to estimates.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "omicron" strain, and up to 2,000 people a day will be taken to hospital at peak.
The British healthcare system will not be able to cope with this.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest studies, the efficiency of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian "Sputnik V" satellite will react to the "omicron" - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Center for the Study of the Evolution of Infectious Diseases has only started testing the Russian vaccine on the "omicron" strain.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the start of vaccinations in schools
The Israeli Ministry of Health has launched an emergency program to increase vaccinations from Sunday.
From the morning of December 12, vaccination against the coronavirus is carried out in schools throughout Israel.

In Brazil, seven people died in the rain
At least seven people were killed and 175 were injured as a result of powerful thunderstorms, which fell on the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia and neighboring Minas Gerais.
This was reported by TASS, citing rescue services.
From the middle of the week a tropical cyclone has been raging on the border of these states, as a result of which the level of rainfall in the region reached 450 mm. In 25 municipalities of the state of Bahia an emergency situation has been declared, and in some of them floods have become the most destructive in 35 years.
Several bridges have been destroyed, two dams in the river, and traffic has been blocked on three roads.
According to the rescuers, around 5,700 people remained without a roof, while 6,700 were forced to leave their homes.
The damage caused by the natural disaster affected over 85,000 residents of the region.

$135 billion went to applications - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user spending on applications grew by 25% worldwide and the number of downloads increased by 8%.
The most popular in the world turned out to be various video services.
Users most often downloaded video editor CapCut, and spent the most time on YouTube.
And the number of app downloads, and user spending on them, showed a significant increase from January to November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. User spending in applications increased even more significantly: by 25% to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile application market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from the lockdown and began post-pandemic recovery.
Is such a "return to physical" growth of the economy an obstacle? Not at all, believe the authors of the report.
The leader in terms of the number of downloads was India: it accounts for about 20% of all downloads.
They are followed by the US (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS devices, as before, spent more than users of Android: 65% of all app spending was on iOS.
Among the applications, the video editor CapCut took the first place in terms of the number of downloads in 2021.
They are followed by two Indian applications: the video service MX TakaTak and the application for online trading Meesho.
Telegram is also in the top 10 for the number of downloads.
On the whole, if judged by the number of downloads, VPN services (two of which are in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services associated with creating and uploading videos are popular (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, two other such services - Moj and SnackVideo - are in the top 10).
Users spent most of their time in apps for live streaming and online streaming, the report says.
YouTube leads the way in terms of user spending, and the top five also includes video services TikTok, Disney+ and HBO Max, as well as Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.
Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok take the first four places in terms of the number of monthly active users, and the top-five is rounded off by the mobile version of Microsoft Office.
In Russia, the leader in terms of the number of downloads per year turned out to be the shopping application AliExpress.
Zenly, which shows your friends' locations, follows, as does CapCut.
Also in the top 10 are: online karaoke StarMaker, online clothing retailer Shein, Maps for Minecraft PE, online taxi ordering service DiDi, YouTube Pure Tuber client, online retailer "Dixi" and online store "Selfie".
All over the world, people adapted to the pandemic through the switch to remote work, which can be called one of the main conclusions.
The sectors that have achieved the greatest success are those that have helped people to feel closer both virtually and in person," commented App Annie's head of market insights Lexi Sydoo.
In 2021, the mobile games sector generated $90 billion in revenue. Casual and hyper-casual games, which have little or no storyline and minimal video content, topped the charts in terms of downloads.
In the top three most popular games in the world are Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the most popular games are DOP 2: Delete One Part; Going Balls; and Phone Case DIY.
Previously, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends for next year, analysts at the company have named the growth of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the growth in popularity of financial apps among Generation Z, for example Robinhood, and the further growth in popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians warned of new scam scheme
Scammers are starting to find new ways to deceive people through video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon's product director Zaura Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is diphtheria.
In this case, scammers create a fake video based on real recordings with the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to precisely reproduce the features of a person's behavior.
Abuatalimov added that using deepfakes, criminals can call acquaintances of the victim via video call or create a video with the likeness of a person for distribution with the aim of extortion.
Such forgeries are easily capable of provoking a bullying situation, since the wrongdoer can place people in absurd, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," the expert said.
Lead systems engineer at Varonis, Alexander Wetkol, added that people are more likely to trust others when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of technologies that use video.
David, added.
In what I've written above, I've focused on the fact that all this was bought in a small town where the local mentality did not allow you to dress up and wear short skirts and show pantyhose with heels.
This is a province, but in the store there was such a product.
In big cities and among Muslims, women started to wear make-up and show off.
That's how it is in Dushanbe, a big city, the capital of the republic.
Lots of make-up, but no same cosmetics.
Five actions to avoid sugar diabetes
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
But some don't give it much importance, and they're wrong.
Sugar diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play the main role in preventing the formation of diseases.
For example, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water positively affects metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
So the first step on the road to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keep them at home.
The appearance of the disease is influenced not only by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of sugar diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Specialists recommend a low-carbohydrate diet.
Such a diet not only helps to lose weight, but also protects against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and the increase in the absorption of food.

Doctor Pavlova told about the "weekend migraine" among the overworkers
A few factors can contribute to worsening mood on weekends
The cause of worsening self-esteem after working days is often "the hangover of the weekend," said a well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of the MGU, and scientific supervisor of the Clinic of System Medicine Zouhra Pavlova in her Telegram channel.
According to her, those who suffer most from this are workaholics, who on weekends suffer from headaches, tiredness and weakness.
Doctor Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue over the week, there are enough objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to the change in conditions.
On weekends our life changes fundamentally.
“We sleep long, all day we lie on the couch, probably eat more, and drink less - the doctor justified. - Because of the lack of coffee, there is a small crack.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and breakdown."
A late rally also helps.
For example, if you go to bed three hours later than usual, you'll get a jetlag-like reaction.
It arises in travellers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays the decisive role in worsening one's mood, Pavlova recommends tracking what changes the most on weekends.

Scientists from South Africa claimed that Pfizer's vaccine against "microcephaly" is ineffective
In South Africa, Pfizer's vaccine against "microcephaly" was declared ineffective
Scientists from South Africa conducted a study and reported low effectiveness of Pfizer's vaccine against the Omicron strain of the coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to (the level of) the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection with symptoms of 22.5%, which... raises doubts about the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, - is said in the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, specialists specified that the drug can prevent a severe course of the disease.
Previously, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the Omicron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar in common products?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
His excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that under the unknown word in the composition of the product may be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition and glycemic index.
On the label, several dozen names can be presented, in essence, indicating sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
Other sweeteners may also be used, such as dextrose (a sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), melasse (blackstrap molasses), agave syrup, and so on.
That's just simple sugars, which are mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in candy, but in ketchup, in doctored sausage, in bread and so on.
As claimed in Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as paying attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar taste different, but no matter what it's called or how it's processed - syrup or nectar, treated or untreated, brown or white - it's still sugar.
It's not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar because you have to take into account not only the amount of sugar stated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits and other foods originally contain a certain amount of sugar.
As a result, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the import of gas is losing importance for Germany as the country continues to switch to a decarbonized economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely refuse from gas, oil and coal by 2045 and become a climate-neutral country.
That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role, the Chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to be committed to the fact that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas in the future, as it is currently an important resource for the country's energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the USA made a statement in which the support of Berlin for the energy transformation of Ukraine was fixed.
Earlier, the head of the German Foreign Ministry, Annalena Berböck, said that the process of certifying the "Nord Stream - 2" gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, within the framework of coalition talks and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also said that the pipeline "does not comply with EU regulations."

Hackers broke into Twitter of the Prime Minister of India
Hackers have broken into the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The criminals managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal payment method, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
In the office of Modi, they asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter responded quickly - access to the account was restored.
The page for the premiere of India was hacked in 2020 and people were encouraged to donate to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, a majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, a third referendum held on December 12 ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, most residents of New Caledonia voted against independence during the referendum.
However, participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted for independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90%, with a total of more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia participating in the elections.
As the agency France-Presse comments on these interim results, "the outcome of the elections did not leave room for doubt," as supporters of independence called on voters not to participate in the vote.
Being the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of COVID-19 on the archipelago hinders holding a full-scale and "fair" election campaign.
This abstention thus opened the way to a third victory for the supporters of French New Caledonia after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, and in 2020 - 53.3%.
As the separatists stated, they do not recognize the results of the recent vote and are challenging them in the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, in the Elysee Palace, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, is to make a statement on the results of this referendum.
The theme of independence for New Caledonia has largely animated the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates expressed support for the territory to remain part of France, as it is "the last region of European Union presence in the Pacific".
“New Caledonia must remain French,” reiterated Eric Zemmour.
Such a statement was made by the Republican candidate, Valerie Pecresse, who published an article in Le Figaro at the end of October, calling on the Caledonians to remain French.
On his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility".
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be a choice of France."
Hello, world!

In Turkey, the world's first drone with a laser weapon was tested
Tests of the world's first drone with a laser weapon have been successful in Turkey.
The BPLA "Eren" was tested at a distance of 100 to 500 meters, "MIR24" reports.

WSJ readers criticize article on Russia-U.S. relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized a column by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the US.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow, and allowed a number of insulting statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "stand up as one front against Russia."
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the professor's position.
There is a lot of false information in this article, - one of the readers, cited by RIA Novosti, commented.
Europe is not ours to "lose," and Ukraine is not our land.

Patches can also be applied to the lips.
The hydrogel used in the production of the Dearboo Brightening Hydrogel Eye Patch is a high-tech polymer that ensures high absorbency and the transmission of high-concentrated natural plant extracts to the skin, which adheres tightly to the skin and gives a sense of freshness.
When it comes to delivering nutrients to the skin, hydrogel minimises the accompanying loss of moisture, and forces the essence to penetrate deep into the skin.

A magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred in the Kuril Islands region
A magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The epicenter was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier seismologists recorded a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new generation of reactive drones
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will start producing ANKA-type reactive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
This was reported by the adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, Alexei Arestovich, on December 11.
That is, they are capable of acting against air targets, against other unmanned aerial vehicles.
Even against piloted aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the fuselage and so on," quotes him Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA drone, Arestovich said that it is a reactive, not a piston, drone.
According to him, this new generation of drones after Bayraktar exceeds it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of BPLA drones should be produced by the factory at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aeronautics and Space Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in collaboration with a number of private companies from 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Staff classified the data on the use of drones Bayraktar and missile complexes Javelin during the military operations of the combined forces in Donbass.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the construction of a factory for the production of modern military drones has begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the company Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, where the personnel will be trained, as well as the testing and maintenance of Turkish BPLA Bayraktar.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from the container in the airport
Lions escaped from the Singapore Changi Airport.
This was reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions, which arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown where they came from and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions took a nap on the container's roof.
The animals couldn't get away because there was a protective net set up nearby.
The stand-off ended after the arrival at the airport of staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which runs all Singapore zoos.
They tranquilized the lions with darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a leopard escaped from its owner and wandered the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and people were not harmed.
Specialists warned of the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies show that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is solid evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less likely to suffer some kinds of cancer, including colon cancer.
However, excessive doses can promote the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitschen advises monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms a day.
The risk of cancer only increases if you significantly deviate from this figure in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, always monitoring the dose and avoiding foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fain called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Since it is found in avocado, among other things, Ms. Fein recommended that men over 50 eat the fruit more often.
In the UK, due to the Omicron strain, around 75,000 people may die by April.
British scientists' forecasts show that due to the spread of the Omicron strain of the coronavirus in the UK, up to 75,000 people may die in the next five months if restrictive measures are not tightened in the winter.
This was reported by the newspaper The Guardian with reference to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists, who are part of the UK Cabinet Office's scientific advisory group on emergencies, by April 2022 the country will have recorded at least 25,000 deaths from the Omicron strain, and a total of 175,000 patients will have been hospitalised.
At the peak of the outbreak, the hospital will receive more than 2,000 infected people every day.
Serious measures to fight the coronavirus may be needed to avoid overburdening the National Health Service if the Omicron strain is more contagious than the Delta variant, and existing vaccines cannot prevent infection," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK's Health Protection Agency said if the spread of the Omicron strain continued at the same rate, there could be around 1 million cases in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the Omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
In the UK, 1,898 cases of the Omicron strain of the coronavirus have been detected, of which 633 were recorded in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.
She wanted to write a smart comment, but couldn't get past this point:
Shub, obtained as a result of unimaginable suffering of an unfortunate animal and its retraining for a second job.
And it all came crashing down!
It turns out the "unfortunate animal" is a man, and I thought it was a rhinoceros!

The global demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and fight climate change.
There are 1,200 yachts ordered in the world register of ships - 25% more than last year.
In the era of the battle against the consequences of climate change for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for more than 50 million dollars will not be reduced, writes the "Guardian."
But there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there has not been such a frenzy in the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are fearful of contracting the virus on land and prefer to hide out from the pandemic on their own vessels.
The second reason is also linked to the coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted by phone.
Broker Will Cristie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts in 2025 and beyond.
It means that buyers are prepared to pay more just to have their yacht ready even one or two years ahead of schedule.
People just want freedom, and the super-rich can afford it, he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior by the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of austerity, travel in space, life on yachts or flights in one's own aircraft cause anger in society, since the elite does not want to share the responsibility for changing the climate with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and are proposing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, even though they know it will be hard to implement given their mobility.
Meanwhile, it is only the number of super-yachts ordered that is impressive, but not their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 ships, 27 have a length of more than 100 metres.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 183-metre yacht called REV Ocean.
After launching, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
There is a "moon pool" on the yacht, as well as an underwater vehicle for studying ocean depths.
On existing superyachts, helipads, cinemas under the open sky and even fighting platforms like the one on Gregor McGregor's yacht are commonplace. Richard Wilkinson, professor of economic anthropology at the University of Manchester, says the carbon footprint of the super-rich, relative to the total number of CO2 emissions from parking lots, is negligible.
But it has symbolic meaning if you consider that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
It's just another example of over-consumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times higher than the average person on the planet.
If one person produces, on average, 5 tonnes of CO2 a year, then the biggest polluter in the world, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tonnes of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
In doing so, two thirds of his emissions were recorded on his yacht Eclipse, which measures 162.5 metres in length.
Even if the owner of the yacht is not on board, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the order to sail the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don't exactly inspire sympathy from other people when they, like the richest woman in Australia, Gina Rinehart, who owns the continent's largest coal mines, whine to YouTube about there being nowhere for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships of 50 metres.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol, leading to the development of colon cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts came to the conclusion that drinking four or more portions of alcoholic drinks a week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
The risk of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
In addition, the risk of developing colorectal cancer is higher in moderately drinking men than in women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of this type of cancer, but only note that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, if not all, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very smart.
But even they don't realise how developed the four-legged offspring actually are.
For many years, biologists have been conducting various experiments to find out how intelligent animals are.
Although a dog's vocabulary isn't as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that a dog can respond to 89 words or phrases in a row.
The works of scientists were published in the Sciencealert edition.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, they don't understand politics, economics or art, but they often manage to deceive their owners.
Experts say some breeds show better results in understanding human language, but there's not enough statistical data for precise conclusions.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - such as Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking and do not lag behind two-year-old children in their ability to learn.

Ukraine is ready for trade with the US and Russia
The US and Russia will "trade" over Ukraine's accession to NATO, said analyst Alexander Kozhevnikov in his article for the "Glavred" publication.
According to him, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations in the near future on the guarantees of the United States of America regarding the fact that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader, Joe Biden, about the right of countries to "go wherever they want".
If you are offered something you know is reprehensible, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you don't negotiate, you just say no and walk away.
As for Ukraine, "trade is planned," the analyst wrote.
Cocheot added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine and is striving for a dialogue with Kyiv.
Training is carried out secretly, quickly and immediately switch to offensive actions, instead of waiting until the group is discovered and the forces of resistance are deployed, he said.
China stimulates the development of the railway transport sector
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the USA, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Exhibition of Railway Transportation and Equipment, held in the city of Chuzhou in the province of Hunan /central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, said the company's representative Hu Changwen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway, which was put into service at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and efficiency of the mobile fleet.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its export of railway vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-storey high-speed electric train developed in China rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. and was exported to Europe.
With a maximum speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will operate on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro, developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey, began.
The train will move along the subway line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The line will open next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
China's railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovative competitiveness, said Feng Yaosian, head of the Department of Trade and Investment Promotion of the China Council for Promoting International Trade /CCPIT/.
This sector is China's main competitive advantage in the global high-end equipment market, said Feng Yaosian.
After more than 60 years of intense work, China has created a leading system of producing equipment for railway transport with a full range of supporting facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosian, the country ranks first in the world in terms of the level of electrification of railways and the operating mileage of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences, Semen Golooshkin, in an interview with radio Sputnik, listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of moderate cognitive disorders, such as an inability to concentrate, plan and abstract thinking.
There is a discussion at the moment about whether hearing loss can be both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its emergence, the expert said.
Goloshchin stressed that dementia can be caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders, and vitamin deficiencies.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of blood vessels in the brain are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
So it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, reducing the risk of developing dementia will help studying foreign languages and active communication.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking.
There are recommendations on the use of various BADs, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still discussed in the scientific community, said Golochekin.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical load, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking, - said Golochekin.
Earlier this year, the UK's Alzheimer's Research Trust said the disease was affecting people in their 40s more often.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be problems with vision, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing mental retardation, experts say, is aphasia - a condition in which a person can't find the right words to say what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili abroad for treatment
Former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the panel of doctors created by the Georgian ombudsman, told journalists.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is leading in his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, and mood swings," - said the specialist, noting that this does not go beyond the norm and now the ex-president needs special rehabilitation.
This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia, - noted Toidze, calling for Saakashvili to be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
In the evening of December 7, Saakashvili started to refuse medical assistance after the penitentiary service officers applied disciplinary punishment to him.
The Georgian politician was quick to have the punishment lifted and his rights reinstated.

Protests against COVID-19 passports took place in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests were held against compulsory certification of vaccination against COVID-19, according to the agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was about 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, COVID-19 passports have become mandatory for trips to bars, restaurants, sports halls, retirement homes and night-time entertainment venues.
Many manifestants came to the action without masks.
Slogans on their posters accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respecting the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, a passport with proof of vaccination is also required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with more than 50 seats.
Protesters in this city have declared a medical dictatorship, and vaccination has been called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of infection with the coronavirus have been identified, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to introduce restrictions for non-vaccinated people.
The government submitted draft laws on a unified system of QR codes to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural establishments, objects of catering and retail trade with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a disease, or a medical record of vaccination.
Such rules will also apply to trips by train and plane.

Steep climb: How Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create resorts of international level in the country
In China, it is expected that the Olympics will not only attract 30 million citizens to take up winter sports, which will allow the collection of the 1 trillion yuan indicated by President Xi Jinping, but also promote the economic development of backward and remote provinces.
The ski resort of Taival in Zhangjiakou, located close to the site of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to building infrastructure in the region, they are also working on landscaping: the workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are big enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, including Changsha, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to ensure comfortable and interesting holidays on Chinese resorts so that all beginners become regulars.
However, that is still a long way off.
Senior adviser on the Games, Justin Downes, says he last visited in 2007 and since then the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year in winter more and more Chinese people go to the mountains.
Fiona, the snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the serious changes required, it will take many years to create a ski culture here, Downs believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Chunli, near the location of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, and now not a single local resident is suffering from unemployment.
More and more shops are opening in the country selling clothes and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, points of general catering with dishes of national cuisine are opened.
There is even a testing station for COVID-19 on Tavua now.
China is striving to create a prosperous winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and facilities should reach the world level.
More than 500 million people worldwide may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO said
More than 500 million people worldwide may be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled progress on universal health coverage, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank said.
In connection with the 12 December International Day of Universal Health Coverage, WHO and the World Bank have published two complementary reports.
In them, they noted that the pandemic caused disruptions in the provision of medical services and caused excessive stress in the healthcare system.
As a result, for the first time in 10 years, the population's coverage by immunization decreased, and deaths from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
The WHO and WB stressed that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so people find it harder to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their pocket."
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that the pandemic had plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, leaving more than four billion practically without social support.

Reuters: Taiwan's minister was disconnected from the live broadcast of the "Democracy Summit" at the request of the White House
The appearance of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology, Audrey Tang, at a panel discussion during the US-organized "Democracy Summit" was translated into an audio-only mode, according to a YouTube recording of the summit.
Reuters news agency, citing sources, reported that the image was removed at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was marked in a separate color from China, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was compiled by the South African NGO CIVICUS and ranked countries by their level of protection of civil rights.
Taiwan was marked green as "free", while China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were marked red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the image on her side was replaced by a screenshot with the comment that "participants' opinions do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government."
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources noted that the map the Taiwanese minister showed could go against Washington's "one China" policy.
One source in the agency said that after the map was displayed, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The "Washington Summit for Democracy," organized by Washington, took place on December 9-10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society and non-governmental organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, the editor-in-chief of the "New Newspaper" Dimitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund, through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of Russia, Yuri Averianov, stated that the summit was "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese."

So a fairy-tale about ecology was invented for the scoundrels, who also work for free, collecting garbage for the idea.
Personally, my contribution to ecology is the refusal to acquire unnecessary things and long-term use of things.
If I go beyond - I don't throw away, I give to charity.

Spacecraft New Shepard with six tourists on board made suborbital flight
On Saturday, December 11, the New Shepard spacecraft, manufactured by Blue Origin, made a suborbital flight with six tourists on board.
The journey, broadcast on the company's website, lasted a total of more than ten minutes, after which the capsule with the passengers descended to Earth, TASS reports.
The launch of the rocket-carrier was carried out from the Vandenberg spaceport in the US state of California.
The ship rose to an altitude of slightly more than 100 km, and space tourists found themselves in a state of weightlessness.
The carrier rocket itself landed on the spaceport's runway.
On July 20, Blue Origin successfully completed the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard spacecraft with passengers on board.

It is not necessary to lump everything together - bad people can be, and you may have specific grounds to complain about them...
But what about the number of children, their age, the pension fund and so on?
Write that they are "thieves who did not return the money."
But it's not your business how many children they have as long as they don't bring their children to hang on your neck.
And if this is excluded, what right do you have to condemn them?
Maybe it's just in education...
Chosen (by themselves) parents dictate their rules, openly violating what already exists.
And if it will be related to other spheres of life, judicial system and so on?
For them the laws are not written.
And if the Pope does introduce his method of education and upbringing?
It's a shame and an example for others.

The State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular requiring strengthening the prevention and control of the epidemic of COVID-19 in cities where land ports of entry are located, with a view to further preventing the import of infection from overseas.
According to the circular, people leaving the aforementioned cities must provide a negative result of the nucleic acid test for COVID-19 obtained within 48 hours of departure.
Those arriving in towns where there are land border checkpoints must undergo at least one test for the nucleic acid of COVID-19 upon arrival.
The document says the requirements will apply from the day the relevant provincial-level administrative units define and publish the zones of the cities in question, up to and including March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities where land border checkpoints are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told about the "sad outcome" of Russia-US relations
Sergey Ryzhkov, the deputy head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, assessed the prospects for Moscow and Washington's relations in an interview with the "Izvestia" newspaper.
He noted that the long road of interaction led to sad conclusions, and problems between the two countries began not yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but as for some prospects for an improvement in relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
It's a sad conclusion based on the outcomes of a long road we've traveled with this administration, and with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems began not yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Riakov, the problem is that the US is trying to impose its approaches to a multitude of issues on Russia.
The head of the MID added that he would not have dared to give optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and did not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, progress is not observed.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to approach issues of international security responsibly and hopes that signals will be heard and Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow is ready to restore the dialogue with the US.
Virologist warns of danger of nasal spray vaccination outside hospitals
There is a risk of allergic reactions in people who have become used to the nasal vaccine against COVID-19, so the first points for vaccination should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of biological nanotechnology, microbiology and virology at the Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It's easier to set up nasal spray vaccination points in airports and shopping centres, but I would do that in medical facilities initially.
The point is that there is a chance of an allergic reaction to the vaccine, it is small, but it is better for a person to stay near a doctor's office afterward.
There are special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work literally within a minute or two, which is sometimes very important," - said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centres when the experience of using the drug will have accumulated.
He also stressed that it is important for the nasal vaccine to reach the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
There is also a chance that the vaccine will not reach its intended destination if the person coughs or sneezes after being injected.

In the UK, 1,239 cases of the Omicron strain of coronavirus were recorded in a day - RT in Russian
In the UK, 1,239 cases of infection with the new Omicron strain of the coronavirus were reported in a day.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the "omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with a new variety of infection in Scotland and five - in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people diagnosed with the new Covid-19 strain in the UK reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine made a pessimistic forecast that 75,000 people could die in the UK from the outbreak of coronavirus caused by the "omicron" strain by April.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that introduce anti-Russian sanctions
Presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov commented on the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including the alleged "invasion" of the country.
It is impossible to introduce some restrictions against Russia and not to suffer ourselves, - said the official representative of the Kremlin in the air of the TV channel "Russia 1".
Peskov says that "everyone in the world understands this."
Earlier it was reported that the US was considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the EU are planning to introduce restrictions that will complicate the conversion of rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, Sberbank CEO German Greff is certain that this is impossible.

Residents of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on independence in New Caledonia, a vast majority of participants refused to secede from France.
This was reported by the French television channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% of those who voted were against independence.
3.51% of the population of the South Pacific archipelago supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
The level of participation in the vote was very low: around 55% of the island's residents came to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the calls of separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the referendum.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia voted in a referendum against independence from France.
A referendum on independence was already held in the region in 2018.
Most residents supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers from the mainland of France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia to be its possession.
There are about 270,000 people living on the archipelago and it has a special administrative territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian authorities that allows the region to hold a vote on independence twice every two years.

WHO considers "omicron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers "Omicron" to be less dangerous than the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there are data on the decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines against the new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, "OmiKron" has been registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and significantly altered antigenic profile of the "Omicron" strain suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is suggested that it ("the severity of the illness" - rare) may be less severe than in "thalassaemia," - says the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that while all registered cases of infection with "Omicron" in the EU are proceeding easily or without symptoms.
At the same time, the new strain appears to be spreading faster than "delta".
Two cases of infection with the Omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They were "previously vaccinated," the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
The head of Russia's consumer protection service, Anna Popova, said there were no reliable data that the new variant of the coronavirus was less dangerous than others.

Four scenarios for Zelensky in Ukraine
Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
According to him, the head of state can remain without support from the West, and also, possibly, make concessions on Donbass.
This was reported by Denisenko in the publication on the "Glavred" portal on Sunday, December 12.
The first option, which Denisenko called an "ideal storm," assumes that Ukraine will no longer be supported by key Western countries reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis, which Kyiv may face in 2023.
At the same time, there is a decrease in prices of key goods that we have traditionally exported... There are internal protests and confrontation with the power by key FPG (financial-industrial groups. - Ed.). - added the ex-parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, when Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
As a result of such a situation, the leadership of Ukraine may go for compromises on Donbass, which could lead to confrontation within the country.
At the end of summer, the positions of Zelensky will weaken, and the probability of such a situation is 50-55%, according to the former MP.
The third scenario for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of those who disagree with Zelensky's population and the president, which could lead to the seizure of control over the power block and the implementation of "populist initiatives."
During such a crisis, Zelensky will start "reforming the authorities," Denisenko added.
Another scenario - the transformation of Zelensky into "the father of the nation".
This can be triggered by some event that will be a strong shock for society.
The event should be of sufficient scale to trigger a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine, Denisenko said.
Such a development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, technogenic catastrophe or aggressive actions by Russia, believes the ex-deputy.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is precisely the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from the "Rating" sociological group showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had fallen to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest rating since he came to power.
Analysts predict a situation where, in the event of the nearest presidential elections in Ukraine, Zelenksy would receive only 21.8% of the vote, while ex-President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko would receive 14.5%.
At the same time, only 19.3% of those surveyed expressed support for the president.

The author thanks you for the story about the great athlete, not knowing that Elena Shushunova died, it's very upsetting to learn this.
I remember how we were rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us residents of the Primorye Territory, it was live coverage, real time.
Such passion, such emotions, I remember the happiness when Elena won.
They were also happy with the other victories, as they were rooting for Salnikov, for the footballers, for all the Soviet athletes at the time.
On TV I saw a documentary about one of Central America's countries, and there they lowered the arrows onto the ship's deck, like barrels.
The pumpkins were huge.
As a young man, I worked picking and loading arbutus in Astrakhan Region and I never met an arbutus weighing more than a pound.
I buy 4-5 kg of arbutus directly from the bazaar and not before the beginning of August.

Bustier with soft lace cups, on a frame.
The lower part of the cup is reinforced with an unelastic transparent film.
The cup's internal sidewall, where the strap is attached, is reinforced with a non-elastic material in a fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that allows the lace not to stretch.
The intricacy of the lace can be seen by the flounce at the waist and under the bust.
Vertically aligned microfibers in the side panels prevent the fabric from bunching up significantly.

The poet arrested for a Red Square action: "10 days for a quotation from Evtushenko, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student from the Higher School of Economics was detained on Red Square with a placard on which the hashtag #poetvrossiyabiggerpoet was written.
This quotation belongs to the writer Evgeny Evtushenko.
Alexander was given a protocol for administrative violation of the order of holding a public event.
He was detained for the first time on January 23 on the Pushkin Square at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
The aim was to draw attention to poetry in general, but, unfortunately, interest in it has been lost, and the decline of culture in general in Russia is also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems under this hashtag in the Internet," - explains Alexander.
We reached out to the young poet to find out more about the circumstances of his arrest and to delve more deeply into the message of his poem.
How have the police dealt with you during previous arrests?
What did the department ask about, and how did they comment on your action?
This time the staff were more correct, the detention was maximum, polite, as if the word "polite" did not sound ridiculous in some context.
The riot police (OMON) and militia took a tough line.
They asked the standard questions about motives.
When they heard about it, in principle, they looked if not approving, then understanding.
Except for the monkey being blown on all four sides, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was doing.
And if after the action under this hashtag begin to write their poems even a few people, I will not spend these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, should speak to you in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe alone.
And at public and official events, they speak the language of the surroundings, so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their mother tongue via an interpreter.
This is the protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks excellent Russian but still uses a translator.
And even at official events, a stenogram is taken by hand, and the stenographer is not obliged to know several languages.
If you don't want to say much, just say no!

Researchers reveal how potatoes can help fight age-related decline
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and minerals that help improve blood flow and lower cholesterol.
The root contains vitamins of the B group, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the organism function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high content of chlorophyll, it is beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract, and can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis if taken regularly.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root vegetable is best boiled or stewed, not fried in oil.
Earlier this year, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, along with other high-glycemic index foods.
These are products with a high glycaemic index, which quickly convert into sugar, such as sugar, sweetened non-alcoholic drinks, white rice and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in their production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
In the opinion of market participants, the current shortage of products can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates remove "Yandex" from distribution
Candidates for elimination
In 2015, right holders from the "Raek/Media" cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate websites on the Russian segment of the Internet, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, director of the Institute of Internet Studies.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - managed to survive thanks to, among other things, regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both "Yandex" and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Orange is the New Black" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest Russian video service ivi (which is part of the AI Vision).
On Kinogo, which is also available via search engines, you can watch the new animated film Enkanto, but judging by the quality of the video, it is a so-called screen (a pirate copy of the film shot in a cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, there is the series "University. 10 years later" by the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom Media").

The "idea developed by the Poles" - it would be more accurate to say that Poland has only reworked the idea of 1776, but has developed it quite effectively.

The wall light Maytoni MOD081WL - L13G3K Tessara.
A wide circle of light, surrounded by "molecules" of light, provides the most even and bright illumination of the space.
The "atomic" or "molecular" design, which reflects the essence and natural nature of each object, is not losing its relevance and allows you to emphasize the accents in the interior.
One of the characteristic features of such lamps is their lightness of construction.
Thanks to thin, practically invisible cords that can be adjusted in height, there is an impression that the light is floating in mid-air.
Metal gold-plated fittings and matte-white miniature ceilings will easily complement any colour scheme, and the collection's suspended chandelier and table lamp will make a ready-made lighting ensemble for the living room, bedroom, and hallway.
Well, in taste and color, as they say.
I really liked "Tarhun," not the current one, of course.
The juices, served in tall glass cylinders, were very tasty.
Three spoonfuls of syrup - enough for me.

DimaX Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimat.
The model is convenient because it has two different, soft and hard, surfaces.
The composition of the product includes only quality and premium fillers, which have proved themselves exclusively on the best side.
Springs: a block of independent springs "micro kit" is installed in the center of the model.
This means that a sleeping place requires 2000 spirals, which work fully autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives the unique point-by-point adjustment.
The "micro-packet" is the most high-frequency piston block of the "Dymaksa" diversity, so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Filled with: on top and bottom, a combination of layers of coir and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface is covered in latex, the other is covered in coconut oil.
Such a tandem of fillers has long been a classic, as it not only conveys orthopedic, but also anatomical properties to the mattress.
If Coyra provides the right support for the spine, latex gives the surface an adaption to the human body.
Case: the model is supplied in a sheer chiffon Aloe Vera case.
If the client wishes, it can be made as a detachable or fixed unit.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, and the recommended load for a sleeping place is 170 kg.
Guarantee and safety: the warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
Orthopedic foam used in mattresses is certified by CertiPUR.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the "Actual Camera" reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions starting five years from now is to assess the suitability of clouds on Venus for life and then search for it there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed instruments for measuring acidity and oxygen content in Venus clouds.
So far, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic to host life, but it is likely that originally Venus was a planet of Earth type.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus is expected to arrive.
Assuming that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to Earth or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that Earthly life did not originate on Earth.
If there is a difference, then it may be more likely that life arose on Earth," - said the leader of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project Mikhkel Paasalu.

Metaphysical entities will change Russian business
The topic of metaverse became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in the creation of its own metaverse and subsequent monetization.
Metaphysical entities should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards creating remote interaction in the conditions of the pandemic, because people are tired of disconnection and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a result of the businesses' desire to develop ecosystems and adapt their operating models to them.
With the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, valuable papers, works of art and even money are transferred to the digital format.
Ania, you are right, changing the diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating properly, you don't want anything too greasy and harmful.

You can eat it by the spoonful, try it - and it's enough.
After all, there are ten weekends ahead, so you can prepare any tasty and useful dishes.

British economist failed to predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022 because, in his opinion, such attempts will end in failure.
He wrote about this for Project Syndicate.
An expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend may change.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, he believes, with inflation in second place.
O'Neill also admitted he didn't know whether the rise in prices was temporary or not.
As indicated by the expert, before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of central banks' infinite generosity has already exhausted itself" and it is time to return to relationships where interest rates will be correlated with expected rates of economic growth, taking inflation into account.
Mr O'Neill noted that, against the backdrop of the pandemic, some experts believe that the continuation of ultra-loose monetary policy could lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, it is important to pay attention to the question of productivity growth, as well as poverty reduction and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Earlier, the head of the global research department at "Discovery Investment" Mikhail Shulgin reported that positive expectations for the course of the dollar in 2022 remain, while the potential for growth will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar, Shulgin named the monetary and credit policy of the Fed, the dynamics of oil prices and fears amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Forced to agree.
But there is one thing that pleases him: if you compare yourself to yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
Progress is slow.
There is another problem: there are many ecological initiatives in cities, but people do not know about them.

Russians gave auto dealers around 4.5% of GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2.784 trillion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period of the previous year, according to the statistical data of the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale, about the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the pandemic of the coronavirus.
In September of last year, at a meeting of the heads of state of the SCO, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is equivalent to more than 4.5% of the country's domestic gross product (GDP) in 2020.
According to the market, the leading position belongs to the Korean brand Kia.
In 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars for a total of 32.57 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year ago.
At the related Kia brand of Hyundai, the growth is even more significant - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of machines is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is in the lead in terms of increasing the average price of automobiles - over the year, the average price of Hyundai cars increased by almost 21%, up to 1,94 million rubles - the dynamics of price growth was stronger only for Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
However, the volumes of sales of Korean brands did not increase significantly: according to the statistics of the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more machines in that period than a year ago.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Japanese Toyota closes the top three leaders in terms of sales volume - Russians spent 27.55 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year ago.
Following the Japanese are Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%), and the German premium brand increased both the volume of sales (by 37%) and the average price of cars (almost 28%, to 820,000 rubles).
At Mercedes-Benz there has been a good increase in sales and the average price - more, for example, than at BMW - which has led to a greater increase in financial capacity, explained the general director of NAPI Tatiana Arabadzhie. -
At the speed of growth, fantastic figures demonstrate the Chinese brands, which also significantly increased their financial capacity this year. "
Russian Lada demonstrates medium-rise dynamics of income (plus 28%); Russians spent RUB 229.4 billion on this brand of cars in 10 months.
At the level of last year, the companies that are in the red in terms of financial capacity are those whose sales of machines fell in 2021: for example, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in the minus - Russians spent 12 billion rubles on UAZ off-roaders and pickups in 10 months against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with supplies of automotive components and disruptions in production, which have affected the entire world's automotive industry, car companies are continuing to revise prices uninterruptedly - the same "AvtoVAZ" raised the price of Lada models seven times a year, the last increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) took place in late November.
They regularly update their price lists for their products and other car manufacturers.
In monetary terms, the automotive market in Russia will continue to grow - in addition to the shortage of machines, inflation is also contributing to this, as well as the automakers' desire to make up for past losses, experts believe.
In conditions of a shortage of cars, I think that many car manufacturers even managed to shift some of the costs incurred in previous periods onto consumers, which they were unable to include in the price of cars before.
says VTB Capital analyst Vladimir Bespalov. -
I think that in financial terms, car manufacturers feel very good at the moment, with high margins on sales."
An indirect indication of this is the rate of growth of the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, the prices of new cars grow faster than inflation, the expert specified.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bessapov.
As the supply of opportunities to raise prices increases, so will the demand.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the next year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, car manufacturers will be able to receive their income due to the volumes, notes independent consultant on the automotive industry Sergey Bulgazliev.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now striving to get the highest profit from each sold car, says Burgazliev. -
An increase in production volumes of machines is not expected at least within the next six months, while in Russia the frenzy is fueled by citizens' uncertainty about the future.
Against the backdrop of the situation in the market, cars have turned out to be a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than the original price, the expert concludes.
Biden expressed his opinion on the transfer of US troops to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion
The United States has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a "invasion" by Russia.
This was stated by the President of the United States, Joe Biden.
There were never any plans like that, the head of the White House said in response to a question from a journalist about whether the US had abandoned such an idea.
Bayden noted that in case of escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops in a unilateral order for the defense of Ukraine is not worth it.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the US will deploy forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to defend them from any attack by Russia," - said Biden.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, underlined that Moscow did not intend to invade Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the use of Turkish drones in combat, as well as the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."

If it's a scammer calling from the same number, like "a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another strong-arm group, you probably won't get rid of them by simply hanging up.
Because to confirm his lie about being linked to the security services he repeats the accusation and continues to frighten and intimidate.

And I can even smile at you.
But I remember that thought is material!

Student film by Alexander Sokurov received European "Oscar" for best editing
The Russian film "How I Ended This Summer," nominated for an "Oscar," won the award in the "Best Editing" category at the European Film Academy (also known as the "European 'Oscar')," reports "Moskovsky Komsomolets."
The jury, which voted online because of the complicated epidemiological situation, appreciated the outstanding skill of the creators of the film.
This time the film "Where Do You Go, Aida?" by Jasmila Žbanić (Bosnia and Herzegovina) won the most awards.
The main character of the film is a translator for the UN mission who tries to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama "Squeezing Fists," shot by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), this film tells the story of complicated relationships between a powerful father and adult children who want to break free of their father's control in North Ossetia.
Earlier it was announced that this film was nominated for the "Oscar" award as the best film in a foreign language.
As regular friendly meetings between the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkey show, to put it mildly, you are not in the topic.
Only yesterday, the president of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian enterprise, KamAZ.
