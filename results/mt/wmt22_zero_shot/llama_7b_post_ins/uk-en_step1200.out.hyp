Good day, please excuse me, I don't have Internet and couldn't send it sooner. Thank you.
Could you please tell me the exact address where to go tomorrow to clean, which code to the keys and at what time tomorrow the guests leave and new guests move in?
Sorry, but I have to decline your proposal as I have already found a job.
Sorry, but I can't refuse.
Sometimes it seems to me that my thoughts in Czech are different from what I wrote in Ukrainian.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Good day, I agree to the course.
However, if it's not too much trouble, could you please tell me if it's time yet?
But I don't live in Prague, there may be difficulties with transport.
If there are no alternatives, I agree anyway.
Thank you in advance.
In Herson, people again took to the streets, and the Russians did not have time to disperse them
As reported by the agency, the participants of the event said that the residents of Kherson managed to hold a rally before the military of the Russian Federation with the equipment arrived to suppress it.
We managed to hold a rally. The equipment of the Russian Federation has arrived there now, - one of the participants of the event said.
In the past, residents traditionally gathered for protests on the square of Freedom - near the building of the ODA and the oblast council.
This area, as well as the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian forces, which use weapons against participants in the rallies and kidnap people.
It was reported that on April 3, armed Russian occupants used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As reported by Ukrinform, residents of Donetsk regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
Russian military uses force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detained.
In addition, Russian occupants are kidnapping residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded the city of Herson with the special title "City-hero".
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin started a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying critical infrastructure, carrying out mass shellings of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages with the use of artillery, rocket systems and ballistic missiles.
I often dream about my dad.
He died the next day after my birthday.
And overall, things are going well.
Hello, Hanah.
That's what you wrote and the phone started charging!
Great news!
Thank you!
We can meet once or twice a year and then I go home because I don't have the necessary things with me.

Apartments in the center of Prague are found.
Will it be convenient for you to come to the bank with me on Monday? Or on another day?
Good day, it would be great if you could do it today as you wrote at 17:00
So I read the Bible, the Quran, other things, to find answers to the questions I was looking for.
Where is the housing that needs to be cleaned?
Do you have good dreams?
In addition to this report, I am sending you the list of vacancies offered to us by employers.
If you are interested in the proposal, please contact the contact person directly in the announcement.
I hope there will be more places, because our relatives, my uncle's wife, her parents and daughter are also coming.
They have tickets for April 20.
Lord, give us a safe journey.
When you come, call me on the phone. The doorbell doesn't work.
It would have been cheaper... we had to move because we can't afford European prices.
I need to look at the place and try where it hurts

Sasha was not at school today, I wrote to the teacher.
Hello üëãüèª I'm ill so it would be better to reschedule our meeting for next weekends, sorry.
I can cook, the main thing is to have a recipe, but I like baking.
In Ukraine, borscht, vareniki, and other dishes are traditional.
I don't have any favorite dishes, I love trying different dishes from different countries.
What do you like to eat? Do you like to cook?
I want to be doing something.
There is a train, but there are no seats
Sorry, but we're a little late.
Luisia, and maybe me as a kitchen assistant?
It is very good that Julia will be able to go to work.
I went to their apartment last night.
There it is very neat and convenient.
On Tuesday, Pablo will tell me if there will be work for Nazar at the brewery and when he needs to come to arrange a meeting.
If Nazar works from 5:30, he can use any train:
Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war. If it stops fighting, our positions will be weak
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the fighting for eastern Ukraine, and in particular for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war ‚Äì and if the Ukrainian army suffers a defeat there, the Russians may leave the negotiations and again occupy the partially occupied territories.
Straight talk: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war at this point.
It is beating ‚Äì we are fighting, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, our positions will be weaker.
They (the defenders of the city ‚Äì editor) are people who drew a lot of enemies to themselves.
The stronger our position is in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the country, in the (OOS) region, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have an advantage in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If the situation is weak in all these directions, we may not wait for the meeting.
Because at that time, Russia will take all these steps that may lead to the return of even those cities that we now occupy.
They can go and do that.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, even uninteresting for the Russian side.
Too bad.
We believe in our result, in our victory...".
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after torturing Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution, if they are in us."
Straight talk: "People will accept the world as it is, because people want this war to end.
In our conditions, in conditions of independence of Ukraine, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think that any peace on any conditions will satisfy them.
But if we speak not emotionally, the war must end with peace, or with millions of victims.
And even there, where millions of victims, everything comes to an end in the war.
So, we must fight ‚Äì but for life.
You cannot fight for dust when there is nothing left, when there are no people.
Good morning, do you have any free places on the course for adults in Czech from 19:00 on Tuesday?
If you wish, you can meet your family in Kutna Hora.
And these two are my cousins.
Yes, I understand.
I'm not sure if I'll be able to finish by 13:00 because there's a big apartment and a lot to do.
I'll try to clean up quickly, but I don't promise.
I will write to you when the apartment is ready for guests.
Who is making the purchases of consumables?
Is this a permanent procedure or do you need to order it as you go?
In connection with the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts are needed to describe its new qualitative state.
The analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of its state
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in contemporary literature allows us to analyze the postmodern context as such, where metaphor plays the role of axiological criterion.
Do you know how to tell online that I got a job and don't need help anymore?

Don't change the topic. Do you want to continue the conversation?
Especially since we go to work and earn money
On Monday we will have a leader and we will decide how and when we will hold a rally
Well, it's a good thing that I've started to panic that I don't understand something and I got lost there.
I think it's the right decision, better to do less and give quality help to these people than when many people
Me and my 16-year-old daughter are looking for temporary accommodation in the Czech Republic, where my daughter plans to study at university.
We finally got to see each other. The conversation was more like a letter, but it wasn't bad.
Help find books in Czech language

But if you don't want to talk to me, I'm sorry
Why did you think you didn't need such an experience?
Every situation is given for something.
Primarily, so that a person changes, especially spiritually.

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine made public the list of Russian military servicemen who took part in committing war crimes in the city of Bucha, Kyiv region.
As reported by Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported this in Facebook.
Every Ukrainian must know their names!
The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine obtained a list of military personnel of the 64th separate motorized infantry brigade, who are directly involved in committing war crimes against the Ukrainian people in the city of Buƒça," the report said.
According to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice for committing war crimes against the civilian population of Ukraine.
The list can be viewed by following the link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and the whole Kyiv region were liberated from Russian invaders.
Mass killings of Russian soldiers and civilians have been recorded in the liberated cities and villages.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, reported that 280 people were buried in mass graves.
General Prosecutor Iryna Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed peaceful citizens were evacuated from the territory of the Kyiv region that had been liberated from the Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The armed forces of the Russian occupiers are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out mass shellings of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages with the use of artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, ballistic missiles, and air bombs.
Good morning, I apologize, but I won't be able to work with you, as I will be flying to Canada in the near future.
There are formal names immediately after the colon, slang expressions in inverted commas, and abbreviations used in the schedule.
I don't want to bother you, rest.
I looked at the weather forecast. It will be cold.
I don't need brands.
Just good clothes at normal prices and in the right sizes.
We were in the store at the railway station
Professions that are offered. Are they possible without knowledge of the language?
It's important if there's such a tradition that I know how to prepare)
I thought it would calm down in a week, but the situation is getting worse, sirens are constantly sounding.
There may be a poor connection on the road tomorrow.
I'm grateful to everyone for their experience, even if it's painful.
I think it's important to learn from every situation so you don't repeat the same mistakes.
Directives are introduced in the form of numbered written additions, which are part of this Regulation.
I am confident that this problem will be solved.
Many people in Ukraine also celebrate this week.
It depends on the religion.
Is the person Greek Catholic or Catholic?
You can try it for free at the beginning.
You can write an algorithm for payment, we will pay ourselves.
Here we have the paper that children receive at the end of the school year, and the certificate is received upon birth and marriage.
Yep! It's like he's an experienced driver! But I don't know if it's better. I feel for the walls of the apartment

I will try to make it. I am still in the town hall, documents to sign.
Wife does not get angry that you are on the phone
In my daily prayers, I thank God and the Theotokos for you.
Let them cover you with their love and warmth of this night.
My heart belongs to you.
You don't mind if I come right after the war, do you?
The place, day and time will be specified according to the interests and capabilities.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It's great, I have money for two months of rent, it doesn't matter where in Ostrava district, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news about the barbaric treatment of civilian population on the north of Kyiv.
Photographs of beheaded and executed people shocked the civilized world.
Dozens of people are asking each other how it was possible for such a thing to happen in the 21st century?! How?!
And I was not surprised at all. It was exactly what I expected...
I evacuated children and old people from Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and have never doubted for a moment that my family would not be spared if the suburbs of Kyiv were occupied.
And I remain absolutely convinced that the essence of the rotten Communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, he simply cannot exist, he is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my grandfathers was shot in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, in the Security Service of Ukraine in Zhytomyr, they gave me the copy of the case of execution of my grandfather: the whole case was over a hundred pages, but the verdict on the death penalty is very simple and even more terrible.
The defendant was illiterate and pleaded not guilty.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was a free man, a poor "one-storey" szlachta, never walked in serfs.
The fact that they lived in the villages and had several cows was enough to condemn the peasant and the nanny of the young children to death.
The family did not even know where he was buried.
My grandmother said they took almost a hundred people from the village and killed everyone but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case there is the name of the student Sharij.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighbouring village.
I believe in genetics and I'm not surprised if his relative was a KGB informer.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, as they say...
The firing squad that sentenced the peasants to death were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing his grandfather's case, he became interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia, like the "Immortal Regiment" that qualitatively recall those years.
Thus, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVD officers have found ways to punish and destroy almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their parents in the 70-80s.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of executioners - the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It is alleged that on the computer there were found files with child pornography, for which she was sent to prison, and there she died quickly.
The KGB murders those who try to find out the truth about the crimes of the past century.
What do you suddenly wonder about their actions now?!
There is concentrated there the most bestial traits of human nature.
The thousand-year-old tradition of the Horde was overlaid by slavery and imperial chauvinism in the 16th-19th centuries.
And then, over that, conducted a bestial genetic experiment, exterminating the intelligentsia in several waves of red terror.
Take a look at the semi-French film "The Checkist" from 1992, and that's how it was.
If you've seen my photos in a bathing suit
Can you ask the group what I can buy from here.
Sorry, I don't have anyone to ask.
I wanted to ask if you know where the children went, because Galya does not know.
Lyubosh, Igor asks if it's convenient for you to go tomorrow? (It's a holiday and he can go, because they haven't looked at the car today).
We don't like to bother you.
You help us a lot, thank you!
‚óªÔ∏è In Borodianka, a suburb of Kyiv, during the demolition of two multi-storey residential buildings, the bodies of 7 civilians were found.
Defenders of Mariupol claimed that an unknown toxic substance was sprayed from a Russian drone over the city.
Three people were injured.
‚óªÔ∏è In Russian prisons, there are about 1,700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians.
Among them are 500 women.
‚óªÔ∏è Germany is allocating ‚Ç¨1 million to support the International Criminal Court, which is investigating war crimes committed by the Russian army in Ukraine.
Canada imposed sanctions on 33 Russian defense companies.
Over the past day, one enemy tank, three armored personnel carriers, three artillery systems, 24 units of automotive technology, one helicopter and three drones have been destroyed in the fighting in eastern Ukraine.
Your coffee is ready today.
My first "bicycle" after my son.
What do girls do when they return from school?
We came to the place where we were settled from the center in Pardubice, the conditions are good.
But there is a big "but" here: men drink alcohol and smoke in the room, loud music is the minimum that "makes you uneasy", the smell of cigarettes and drunk men ... it's scary to lie down and sleep if you're honest.
Be kind, help with housing, for money be kind.
But it will be safe there and there will be no smoking.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is so strong, as if they are smoking.
I'm begging you, one of them is barely standing up, something is screaming, he doesn't like something. It's terrible.
I just ask if you can helpüôèüèº
The main thing is that we understood each other
Very positive, such a wonderful kindergarten, such nice teachers.

How do I get to the apartment today to clean?
Where will you be at the main entrance and I will tell you and you will open?
I wanted to look at the cake for Carina
I forgot to write to you, sorry.
Things went very well yesterday.
We talked about children with special needs and the system of their education in Ukraine.
When Ms. Shakhova introduced me as an Fpoint employee, the first question was how they found the dog, how they found the moped.
Everyone is watching the Facebook page.
They asked to pass on their greetings and say that they are very interested in reading the news.
They talked about the Roma people who have privileges in Ukraine.
We agreed that if a child comes and the parents are not at all able to understand Czech, then after work I can help them by phone.
I need to change the bed linen, 2 sets.
I like holidays.
I have free time, and we only go to the great feast.
Thank youüèµÔ∏èüèµÔ∏ètoday I write my data for work

There is a long queue at General Chapek.
Everyone has a chance.
The main thing is that love should be real and mutual.
I don't know how it is in Europe, but in our country people get married for various reasons, mostly mercenary and commercial ones.
And for me the problem is that if I don't love a person, nothing will come of it.
So, we took her home right away.
She was very grateful, she cried.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said, if possible, there will be some old blankets and pillows.
But it's not obligatory. Only if you want. I'm also very grateful to you.
I'm sorry I hurt him.
In front of him they killed my best friend.
I had a lot of questions to God about why things were happening in my life that just made me want to give up on everything.
And the little grocery stores are working? I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made the collection.
That's how it is, but we're not orienting ourselves in the area and don't know where everything is. We spent an hour looking for a supermarket and walked back. The blankets are too small, so we need two big ones.
Even sick, I thought about you, and you wrote to me.
Is your dad the only one in the family who can speak Russian?
It is possible for children to come to Vali and play in the yard.
OK, let's risk it then :)
I am also glad to have met you.
For housing, I talked to Volodymyr. He said that he would call me when he finds an apartment, or that we would look for an apartment together. There is an institution here that helps you find housing.
Because of the little one, I'm breaking the barrier üòÇüôÉ
I didn't know the answers to some of their questions.
It was good on Thursday, if possible
I can't call a doctor because I haven't done the food hygiene test yet.
But I can't call him because I have no money on my account.
I cannot replenish the phone because I do not understand Czech online banking, and the Ukrainian bank card is not replenished.
In addition, I cannot change the tariff to have normal calls and the Internet to be replenished.
I am going crazy.
The price is not the face, but the face... The title is not right, what did you mean?
I'm ashamed to sit without work
Just wrote that in school at the lesson
Sorry for the trouble, I was just really
That's closer to when they leave Ukraine to know exactly what they're getting.
And there is a question in all of our lives.
So, 10-11 years. But our sizes don't match. Everything needs to be measured.
I am looking for everything for the house and for the child.
Thank you people for accepting me, I live in the chapel, they always ask me if I need anything and I'm ashamed to say I ask myself.
I just came home, and now I'm having lunch :)
Please, don't explain anything, just do what you like.
It is impossible to answer without a resume.
Mom, I can't tell you!
And right now I'm feeling a bit raw that I couldn't hold myself together before we left the flat... like tonight...
God give me strength, Yura. Maybe I‚Äôll fall asleep right away, just for a little while.
I will write to you in any case.
Hello. Susana will help you. I have received my payment for March. I don't know whether it is for two of us with Yuliya or just for me, I can't understand why such a sum.
For example, you can make copies of passports when it suits you :)

I turned to Caritas, who offered me temporary accommodation for a week ‚Äì two nights, but I need somewhere permanent where I can be with my child, and there are fewer and fewer options
Flowers bloomed. Everything is normal. Everyone is rested and very pretty.
As reported by the "European truth", this writes Welt with reference to the sources in the government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the relevant proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economics on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including the training kit and spares, amounts to ‚Ç¨170 million.
Howitzers are also offered in the version for BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks have to get close to the target in battle, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire over 30 kilometres away.
As reported by the Ukrainian government circles with reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be carried out in a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the gaps created will be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers may be delivered within 30 months of signing the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed until 2027.
Is it in the morning or in the afternoon?
Thank you, we'll find out how to replenish the ranks and recruit. I'll write to you. Thank you.
I am going to work without passing the commission tomorrow, and after my doctor recovers, I will pass the commission, right?
How can I change my T-Mobile package to 4 gigabytes for 249 kroner?

You can wash the floor or dishes.

I am young and active, I am 21 years old.
I agree to any work.
I speak Czech at a basic level, but I learn every day, so I think I learn everything I need to work without problems.

Hello. I'll be waiting for you at 6 o'clock.
How much did you study for this specialization?

Sorry, I got confused.
I didn't understand Czech that well back then.
Probably I made something up.
So they go to school, the three of them, and Gala and Svyatoslav study remotely and finish school in Ukraine and receive certificates of completion in the fall, and they have to enter university.
How do I get to the city center?
I share with you my thoughts.
For me, marriage is the mystery of two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A man and a woman decide issues in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we will be together.
Why not try this way?
I rented a car for 9 people, we are coming with Maria and your family.
How much time do you have? What time do you have to leave?
Yes, I'm happy to listen to jazz.
Thanks to this application, I work for it on Wednesdays
For the last four years I haven't let anyone get close to me, I've read a lot of books on philosophy and introspected.

Martin, we're going to bed.
Thank you for such a nice and cheerful day.

I know it's hard for you.
But I approach it so that we are together. That we are a couple.
I would have said that after the war there will be a lot of work.
So I'm not afraid that I won't find her there.
I can do a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid that I didn't get into one of them.

Don't worry about it.

Write the address in Czech, let's see where it is on the map
I don't know how many free places there are there so I can't plan anything with furniture I want to finally see that apartment this week and then understand what furniture I need
Sorry for the long response, it was a working day and hard to adapt.

And as for me, I'm speechless (it's just the peak I can't reach)!
How do you feel today? üòÖ after the celebration?
Hello, world, I just woke up, I'm sleepy
Think about it.
I was upset that we started the test with Colleen poorly yesterday.
I will ask either Grigory Denisenko or Yonashuk) to help me with mathematical concepts.
Could I be of any use to them?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to use mathematical terms during the weekends.
Geometry in general is difficult, but we have to work with the Cylinder so that there are no mistakes.
Thank you for the test tasks.
We too are very hopeful
And so she is very happy to give any present
Yab wanted to connect the internet to her Czech number
Yesterday, on the 402 bus stop, I met a Ukrainian - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and anger...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night, thanking God for this girl, because it's the first person from Ukraine who felt my heart's sincerity.
The branch in hall No. 29 is set up specially to receive and process applications for aid
It turned out that I ordered a reserve map.
It's not worth it, I'm just a simple person.
So she wouldn't be frightened that no one came
I didn't go out. I stayed home and baked. I can do it! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So, are you leaving the city for a long time?
A year ago, in the Memorial Center of the Holocaust "Babi Yar" in Kiev, we paid tribute to the 80th anniversary of the mass execution of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babi Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke about "a common basis for international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and safe Europe.
We must protect this foundation ‚Äì it is also part of our responsibility related to our history."
If "the demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us, the Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight must go on."
Today, Russia is attacking a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of peaceful residents, starving the residents of blockaded cities to death, and letting them die from diseases.
Russian troops are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually reminiscent of the Babi Yar shootings.
For over a month Germans have been seeing this in the news in real time.
For example, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, and also weapons that were unimaginable not so long ago.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means more than fighting against the swastika.
This means fighting all possible ways against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to overcome evil and stop the barbarism that is taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you
We agree, let's organize an excursion and write when to be gathered
Everyone was sick, but Lydia was not. There was a new type of coccidia.

I use it instead of a card
Ring for late documents.

Sergiy Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO is no longer a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO, and only 18% of those surveyed were in favour.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbass, the number of opponents of NATO began to fall, while supporters, on the contrary, began to grow.
After the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among the Ukrainian population - over 75%.
Despite the support of Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO is providing in wartime, there is now a lot of criticism of the Alliance and its members - for inadequate supply of weapons, refusal to close the sky, unwillingness to "irritate" Russia.
In addition, there is a big risk that Ukraine will be forced to refuse to seek membership in the alliance because of Russia's position, if this can stop the war and Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In a new episode of the podcast "Hard Questions," together with the editor-in-chief of "European Truth," we discuss how exactly the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our perspective of joining NATO is closer now than ever before, why security guarantees, which are being negotiated with Russia, can become the second Budapest Memorandum, and much more.
What do you think?
In my opinion, this is a notification that my application is under consideration.
I sent it through this mobile app.
There are no visas, we need to go to the congress center and find out how to do it, because it was organized in Poland, where they did not give visas, but gave a passport.
We will definitely write to you!
Denis went out today in a good mood.
He agreed to meet a boy from Ukraine, whom he met yesterday, near the school so that he could show him everything.
So, I hope everything is all right with him.
That's how I don't like it, I don't have enough time
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent tanks T-72 and combat vehicles to Ukraine.
I leave the children there and wait for 3-4 years and go home because I can't leave.
And take it at 6-7 a.m.
There was a sick heart.
I had real feelings for this person, but he didn't behave very well and I left him.
After a while he came back and asked me for forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then, some time later, he telephoned to say that he had had a heart operation.
When I asked him to just talk to me, it became his fault.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
We talked a lot during this time.
At that time, I had problems at work.
His support also helped me at that time.
This mutual help.
And I thought, maybe it really is necessary to look at it differently.
And he proposed to me, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God himself decided our destinies.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage for you?
And he only speaks Czech
I wanted to say that I found an apartment and I'm really happy about it üòä now I have a place to live and a place to be with my kid.

I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I perfectly understand the value of unqualified work, and I understand that I will not be able to have such a job as I had in Kiev here, and the money I earned at home I will not receive here now.
But I can't just sit and do nothing because then all the bad thoughts come into my head and I need to keep myself occupied with something physical.
From 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. documents are processed in the airport, at other times you can just wait.

He comes to visit you.
Could you please say, if you have a rough schedule of cleaning your apartment a month in advance, even approximately which days?
I don't remember this schedule )
Russian army threatens to launch rocket strikes on Kyiv: "This has never been done before"
Direct words by Konashenkov: "We see attempts of diversion and assignments of strikes by Ukrainian troops against targets in the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike at the centers of decision-making, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army previously refrained."
Russia has been launching rocket attacks against Kyiv since the first days of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles, which were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system, fell on a multi-apartment building in the capital's Podil district.
On 26 February, a Russian rocket hit a multi-storey building on Valeriya Lobanovsky Prospekt.
On March 1, Russians hit the TV mast on the outskirts of Donetsk, near Babi Yar, killing five passersby.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian rockets flying in the direction of the building of the Ministry of Defense at the South Railway Station.
On March 14, fragments of a missile shot down by the occupants exploded a house and a trolleybus in Kyiv's Kurenivka
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential area in Vinohrady, killing one person and wounding 19, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center on Vinogradar, resulting in the death of at least 4 people.
Kiev Mayor Vitaly Klitschko once again stated on April 13 that residents of the capital who were evacuated from the city should not yet return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still launch rocket attacks on Kyiv, and besides that, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition in the suburbs of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians were planning a series of terrorist attacks in Russia in order to accuse Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army towards civilian population.
On April 1 near Belgorod in Russia, an oil depot exploded, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, local authorities in Belgrade announced that a "Ukrainian missile" had fallen near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in Washington and Berlin are throwing cold water on the idea that the people's fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky over Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their voters and societies overall.
With his speeches in parliaments and before the tens of thousands of people on the squares of the biggest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was unavailable to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elect these politicians.
And these speeches, this exquisite blend of strength and tenderness and hope, slowly but surely achieve their aim.
While Biden categorically opposes the closure of the sky, 70% of his compatriots have already supported this idea.
Although Paris and Brussels oppose accelerating Ukraine's entry, the process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want you to think we are fraudsters.
The money you raise would be better spent on those who need it more.

There is hope... this won't last long.
At the moment... we are negotiating something.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go? I have no one and nowhere.
I had $50 in my pocket. Everything we spent at home.
Many managers did not pay wages to our workers.
Where should I go? Who do I need? How do I support my children? Where should I live?
You can't take many things.
You didn't take anything from home... you're going 1000 kilometres.
You don't know whether there will be anything to feed them tomorrow, or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children around all over Prague.
What next? We don't know. How many? We don't know. Children ask for sweets. And you can't. It's expensive for you.
And with every thug - we don't have such people.
The choice is to stay there and put children in danger, or try to escape.
She was very happy with the hearts and things that the children gave her when she came to school.

These are gas station attendants who stood on the highway in the first days of the war and patiently served scared and nervous people.
These are the communal workers who remove the rubbish under fire, repair water pipes and power lines to ensure people have what they need.
These are doctors and nurses who work 24 hours a day and save lives without complaining, and in their free time will volunteer to collect medicines for the front.

Is it acceptable for an 8-year-old girl?
I am looking for accommodation for us with my daughter for 3-4 days when we come to the Czech Republic and passports for obtaining visas to Canada.
In Warsaw, there are a lot of people in the visa center and the on-line queue doesn't work.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far away, the train ride takes a lot of time, and it will be hard for the child.
So she decided to look for an apartment in Prague or near it.

Until that time - put stamps like that and then equated these stamps to visas
The Ukrainian Overseas Electoral District (ZVV Ukraine) is an electoral district that unites the electoral districts located outside Ukraine and consists of the premises for voting in the embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises on military bases abroad, where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents are stationed (Kosovo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo).[1] The Central Election Commission performs the role of the district election commission for the Ukrainian Overseas Electoral District.

What kind of apples are these?
The head of the president's office, Andriy Yermak, reported that Russia is starting a "fake operation" regarding the weapons that our allies are giving us.
Direct words by Yermak: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness, and seek to "derail" arms supplies by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes - the alleged destruction of the S-300 missile systems transferred to Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What next? We know the Russian scenarios. The name of one of them.
They can launch fake stories that Ukrainian soldiers seem to surrender with weapons from allies, and it massively switches to the Russian army.
I want to immediately debunk such fakes.
And the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to that world.
Sorry, could you please remind me how much a baby costs a month and if it will work in the summer?

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged of Russian forces committing atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, with Moscow dismissing the reports as a "provocation."
The message about the killed, raped and severely injured Ukrainian peaceful citizens by the Russian troops is worthy of condemnation," - Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern said to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
Russia must answer for what it has done to the world," she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The announcements came after reports of the killing of scores of peaceful residents by Russian troops who had withdrawn from the area after occupying it for several weeks.
Photographs purporting to show the bodies of civilian victims with their hands tied behind their backs have shocked many and prompted calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in an April 4 radio interview that there were signs that Russian forces had committed "war crimes" in Bukhara.
What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes will not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state TV late on April 3, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a "provocation."
Without evidence, she claimed that the United States and NATO "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
In this case, "it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first hours after the emergence of these materials does not create any doubts about who 'ordered' this story," said Zakharova.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defense also stated, without evidence, that the image of Buzi was "another staging of the Kiev regime," and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow called on the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation" by Ukrainian radicals in Bucha.
The Russian Investigative Committee made an announcement on April 4, in which it declared a "preliminary investigation" on charges of spreading "knowingly false information" about the actions of the Russian troops in Bucha by Ukraine.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the nation on April 3, accusing Russian forces of committing "genocide" in the city and telling the leaders of the Kremlin that they needed to come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
I want all the heads of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are executed," Zelensky said in a video appeal, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the face," he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand," he said of the scenes of victims strewn across the streets of Bucha, a town some 35 kilometres north-west of Kiev.
A correspondent for the Ukrainian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty saw the bodies of what appeared to be civilian on the streets of a small town on April 2.
A correspondent saw 10 bodies in one place on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Buhaya.
The bodies of nine people - all civilians - were found strewn on the ground near the site, which local residents say was used by Russian forces as a base.
It appears the victims were shot at close range.
Ukrainian authorities have said that the bodies of at least 410 civilian have been found in the Kyiv area, which was controlled by Russian forces a week ago.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
They were told: "Kiev is not there." How occupants in disguise smuggled Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
There is another point in this list, about which there is significantly less information ‚Äì the evacuation of local population to the territory of the enemy.
Around mid-March, Russian occupants "evacuate" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements on their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed president Lukashenko actually gave under the Russian military polygon.
"Ukrainska Pravda" has tracked down the Ukrainians and their relatives who were taken away to find out how the "evacuation" is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to a forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and out of desperation.
Fortunately, they are alive and in contact with their families.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were forcibly taken to Russia and Belarus.
In Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, and took children from there without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian champion swimmer Yosyp Zatsypinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Gorlivka a few months before the war.
Alexander got a job at the "Antonov" airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
Like true plastun, Denis and Marina had prepared three backpacks in advance, but on the morning of February 24, they were not able to evacuate.
There were no cars in them, and the suburban buses were already full.
Around 12 noon on February 24, they saw helicopters with the letter V, followed by the first missiles.
One of them hit the neighbouring house.
The family went downstairs and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military evacuated them to Belarus.
A total of about 40 people were hidden in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
At 6 p.m. on February 24, people came to the entrance who were speaking a language that was neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
Fuel: "Is there anyone?" - I say that. - "Get out!"
They searched me, stripped me, asked who was in the basement, if there was weapons.
All the men were asked if they served in the army.
Women were told: "We came to protect you at the request of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was the Chechen OMON, even not the troops, young guys of 25-35.
They said: "We were helped in the war by the Ukrainians, Sashko Biyliy (commander of the nationalist UNA-UNSO "Viking" battalion, which fought on the Chechen side in the first Russian-Chechen war ‚Äì the UP), and now we have come to help you."
On the third day they asked what was missing.
We say that there was a big problem with water.
They broke into the store, took the goods under the pretext that "Russians will take them anyway," and brought us six bottles.
There is also online video of children thanking Kadyrov for food.
So, after robbing a store, they brought meat and say: "We understand that it's wrong, but we need the video for Ramzan Ahmatovich."
Nobody wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says: "You have seven days to give back our phones" - they laughed.
They were constantly separating themselves from the Russians.
They said that they are glad that they have come, because they did not want the war, and the Ukrainians are supported by them, and in general, they are good people: "Putin is a scoundrel, and so is Kadyrov, but we can do nothing about it, because our families are there."
And mostly they didn't fight, they went out to loot shops, to steal.
They brought a chicken, tied a Georgian ribbon to one leg, and a white sock to the other, and called it an "insurgent."
They arrived in Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence service worked... When they were beating people up in Bucha, so badly that they didn't even take away the dead, they asked us: "Do you have any artillery?"
More than that, we had detachments ‚Äì the Chechens did not know one another, in the first days they asked each other's passwords in order to establish who was friend or foe.
They were with us until the 13th of March, after which the Russian OMON came, and after them ‚Äì the Omsk detachment.
They put 30-40 units of equipment between the houses ‚Äì ours kept getting caught in it with the "Bayraktars."
But they came and told us that the ZSU no longer exists, but there is the "Azov" and, according to them, "Azov" has thousands of supporters in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kiev has already surrendered" has been pushed since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian came to us - either an officer of the landing force or a representative of the FSB - and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio - there was an item about Bucha, Hostomel, and we thought, maybe they'll give us a "green corridor" too.
From the very beginning we transferred our lists to the Chechens, who promised to get in touch with the Ukrainian command.
But they tell us: "You are being taken to Belarus, and then, maybe, to Rostov."
We are saying that we don't want to go there or there.
To which they replied: "Well, fuck your children's psyches!"
How it worked: They would chase us down into the basement and start shooting from under the house - whether with grenades or machine guns.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses simply burned, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit on the third floor of our house.
They later agreed to take us to Belarus, pledging to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some didn't go, saying it was for traitors - we'll be shot there, sold for organs, they said.
We were driven through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burning heaps, broken technology, although the Belorussians said that the Russians take the technology away from them immediately.
A lot of cannons, buried technology and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Koyar" we passed an improvised control, many people were without documents because they had burned.
We were placed in Red Cross tents and given tea.
And here we hear shots! The rocket is fired, and we can see the trace ‚Äì it worked the ‚ÄúIskander‚Äù system against Kyiv.
Although the Red Cross of Belarus said: "No, it's planes flying, turning at the border."
But we are aviation, we have education, we understand that.
Then we were loaded into a bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.
His boss, Hungarian Vasyl Stepanovych, says: "Here's a joke for you, I'm from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these your thieves are beaten.
Poor people suffer!
And here Lukashenko is such a good guy!
As he said, so shall it be.
They offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but nobody wanted to.
The sanatorium administration said to us: "You are traitors!"
People from the Red Cross and the UN (at least, that is what they called themselves) spread disinformation that men are not allowed to go to Poland.
Many believed it and stayed away from Belarus.
But we decided to go anyway, even though we had a problem with documents ‚Äì our daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We had it on Monday to receive, and on Thursday the war began.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us in any way, and at the train station in Minsk they said that no one will take anyone in a bus without a passport.
I would like to say that the Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk and accompanied.
They did not hold the sanatorium by force.
Our second group of migrants was told by a migration representative that they can stay here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not in Europe, and there are no payments here.
We found an internal transporter who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
Driving by Mozirya (around 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border ‚Äì UA), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles at Ukraine: the rocket first takes off, glimmers beautifully, and then fades away.
People who got on the bus in Mozir said that the Russians were constantly shooting from the polygon there.
But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are being released from the army.
One woman told us that if her son is called, she breaks something.
However, the north of Belarus, where Minsk is, generally do not believe.
They say: "You are lying, we are a peaceful people."
They do not accept that their polygon is used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland we waited for our friends who brought us to Estonia.
At the moment we are registering, deciding what to do next.
In Estonia, there are as many Ukrainian flags as there are Estonian ones.
Marina lived in the military town of Hostomel with her family ‚Äì her brother, his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
In the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to gather the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to sleep in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself was unable to return home and in principle will never be able to ‚Äì the house no longer exists.
Nobody knew anything about evacuation.
And on Monday, somewhere in the center, you won't be able to?
Thank you, everything is with us. And you are always welcome!
Thank you for the agreement, the motels are great
And in this little flat there‚Äôs no Wi-Fi, mostly because I don‚Äôt know how to be? And the children have online classes on Monday and there‚Äôs no internet.
In other words, will I live with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is this family ready to accept us?
In the Koran it is written: "Even a leaf falls from a tree with its knowledge."
Our children learn online, I am a salesperson and a cook, but I can work as a cleaner as well, so I am a jack-of-all-trades. Mar‚Äôyana is a specialist in growing mushrooms. She can work from home. The second Mar‚Äôyana has no specialization, so she is a jack-of-all-trades as well.
Is it possible to do it better?
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, reported joyful news ‚Äì the Ukrainian military had liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupants were thrown out of all of Kyiv Oblast.
But the joy that Ukrainians should have felt at that moment was dimmed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that the Russians had shot dead no fewer than 280 peaceful residents of Bucha.
They were just killed on the street, some had their hands tied and were shot in the face, some of the killed were minors.
The bodies of Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and their son Alexander, who were abducted on 23 March, were found with signs of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were found in a common grave, while Igor's body was found in a sewer.
Bodies of several naked women, wrapped in carpets, have been found near the road, 20 km away from Kiev.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, no one will be at home.
I ordered a parcel from Germany using DHL.
I ordered it to be delivered to me yesterday, but no one contacted me and the parcel was not delivered, and on the DHL website it says the recipient could not be found.
So the parcel was sent to the post and the address of this department was indicated.
How can I take it?
I used to go there every day, several times a day when I was small. The river was just a stone's throw from the house, but now I hardly ever go - I don't have the time, and sometimes I lack the desire. I go only with my sister)

The Archdiocesan Caritas Olomouc wants to organize a project interesting for Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic, namely in the city of Olomouc.

Then they can rape, torture the body and children see it all.
Good morning, I'm talking to you about my thoughts - I need to learn Czech and you can't get away from the news.
I talk to you often. It seems to me that you hear my thoughts.
President Volodymyr Zelensky said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European truth."
All the equipment that they have already sent, for some types of equipment, this has been done too late.
So, when we talk about, for example, Mariupol, and you lose thousands of people, and now what?
I see 100-percent support from the leaders of some countries.
Some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," - said Zelensky.
When asked if Ukraine has received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied, "No, no."
The president also said that if Ukraine had been a member of NATO, there would have been no war, or it would have had a different appearance.
It would have developed differently, we would have had the support of our neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I am convinced that there would have been no war," he added.
We remind you that the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
My dream is to end the war and return home.
Write to me about everything that will be necessary, please.
I wanted to ask you, do you know where the blender appeared in our kitchen?

And the mother's prayer is the most powerful.
I hear a lot - a war on 10% of the territories of Ukraine.
Why do people flee?
Why don't you live on the territory where there is no war?
Are you in your senses?
Did you live in a warring country?
When prices rose by 100-200%.
Because most businesses are not working.
When there is nothing to earn.
When do children hear PVO?
Did you live like that?
You have no imagination.
And may God not have it.
If you still don't know - it will be a shame.
So we run away.
Some of us are lost, with phones ... that were left from our other life ... so some of us didn't adapt for a month.
And you will be able to adapt to 0 in a month.
For example, the state gives us 5000 crowns.

It will be written on his doors, he is the head of the department.

If Ms Krzkowska is not here yet, wait a minute, she said, as she has a meeting, but she knows about you, she ordered you to come at 9 a.m. precisely so that you could get to the doctor in time.
So, of course, it would be very good to spend time together

There are also many nuances in men
He was a very wealthy man, but I liked him because he had his own point of view on life. I met him, then I left him.
He was a very wealthy man, and a few months later he called and said he'd had a heart operation.
Asking me to just talk to him and support him, it became his fault.
He was a very wealthy man and he thought he could take my toys and take my money.
And then he made me an offer.
There was a car standing in my yard, similar to a crocodile, and it was raining.
And they kept me in the house, then brought me to the basement, where there were about 400 people and it was impossible to breathe.
As for housing, what you photographed
I have not got there yet
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already denied this fake.

Good, he'll come and take them there.
I am not greedy for everything.
I understand that I cannot sit with you, I need to work.
I understand. Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 and Ukrainian television in general.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is a pro-presidential, propaganda channel, which is not interesting to me at all

I tell her that "television and radio repair" has been delayed due to import parts, and that friends and acquaintances have been warned not to hang up when calling.
We've been hiding the war news from granny for a whole month.
For now, it's working.
However, in Plymki (kitten - UP), on the belly and back legs, there is a lack of fur - this can be stress, diet changes and vitamin deficiency.
The last two causes have been eliminated, but stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
Plamka, unlike the grandmother, is not deaf, she can hear sirens and explosions."
Thanks to the fact that Olga is hard of hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her niece lived with her "incognito" for a month.
On 1 April, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took a gun in her hands for the first time in her life.
I lived with her as a partisan for 33 days.
She hid both the war and the fact that I was there - formally came for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend started talking, I gave her the receiver - she listened for four hours, then two hours of singing."
The radio was always by the bed.
Most of the time the grandmother spends in her room.
Hearing is bad - it allowed me to be imperceptible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walking," I hid in my room.
First of all, she hid the receiver and the TV.
Then she called everyone she knows. Six or seven people.
She asked to talk about anything but the war.
I called my girlfriend, she was there from the start and to the end

The Briton, who was defending Mariupol in the ranks of the ZSU, says that he is ready to surrender to the Russians.
A Briton who is a soldier in the Ukrainian Marine Corps, which is defending Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Edwin Eriksson, a Briton who has served in the Ukrainian army since 2018, with a reference to members of his family and friends, Atlas News with a reference to the words of a friend of Eriksson who talked to him
Translation of tweet by Eyslin: "We received a message from him: "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything possible to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian troops.
We have enough food and ammunition.
Thank you everyone, I hope the war will end soon."
Details: Elysine served in the 36th separate marine infantry brigade of the ZSU, which is taking part in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
Journalists from the BBC spoke to the mother of the serviceman, En Woo, who confirmed that her son had called to say they were planning to surrender.
A fellow soldier, Brett Phillips, also confirmed to journalists that in their last phone call, Iselin spoke of plans for their unit to surrender.
According to his words, ammunition and food ran out in the brigade.
Journalists from the Atlas News outlet contacted his friend, who said that the unit of Eshlin intends to surrender to the Russian units in order not to fall into the hands of the so-called "Kadyrovtsy" without weapons and ammunition.
Audio recordings of telephone conversations were also spread in social media, on which Eyslin allegedly talks to his American friend, who plans to travel to Ukraine.
In the interview, Eshlin said they tried to escape the city in civilian clothes, but failed.
Earlier, the Briton said that in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company "Wagner".
Eslwin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, but between 2015 and 2017 he travelled to Syria to fight against the terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State".
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the ZSU and took an oath.
His friends and close ones called him John, and in social networks he is better known under the nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you. But I also wanted to know. Are we together or not?

The climate is almost the same.
My family is fine, my mother, three brothers and husband are left.
One brother is fighting in Mariupol, the other in Zaporizhia, and today the husband was transferred from Kiev to Kharkiv.
I call every day and say everything is fine, but there is someone who knows it‚Äôs not true.
I wanted to come to you, but I wanted to settle some matters. When
I ask the man in the morning if he will be ready tomorrow.
When you come home, write me, please, I need to talk to Daniel.
The attackers, the Bolsheviks, recovered from their losses in the battle.
They shot the teacher, Dmytro Pavlyk, his unknown relative by name, and a young man, Boris Oleksiyenko.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep pit, which was covered with earth."
According to memories, "there was a dead silence in the city."
Rarely, someone from the residents passed by from house to house.
Bodies of those executed by the Bolsheviks were often found on the streets.
And I, perhaps, will go with you. You are needed by me. I cannot do without you.
3. What is your own activity/activity that helped you or your friends better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?
But you won't get through because the railway is being reconstructed and the crossing is closed.
When you get to the bridge where the reconstruction is, tell me that you are approaching and I will come to you.

I'm not afraid of robots, as I also lived in a village, so I can work physically.

Very interesting is your tradition, we celebrate like this on Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted the bill 7176, entitled "On the Implementation of Monitoring of Potential Threats to National Security of Ukraine in the Field of Economy".
It is strange that, in fact, the only potential threat to national security in the sphere of the economy turned out to be... the place where members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill consider that the adoption of decisions by the supervisory board of the state-owned company in the simulated Kyiv may somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We know about a large number of new risks for state-owned companies, but we don't know of any company that has needed to physically hold board meetings at the location of its registration.
The potential threat of such a law is clear - it is a wonderful foundation for "wiping out" all the achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing a manual of control.
That which was until 2015.
Why should state-owned companies have supervisory boards and who should be on them?
More than that ‚Äì if one harmful draft law "takes off" under patriotic slogans, then other harmful draft laws may take off tomorrow ‚Äì for example, the system of state procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
A lot can be blamed on the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the beginning of the war and the draft law 7176.
This norm was introduced into the bill's comparative table on February 22.
And in general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some popular deputies for a long time.
Not because of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will examine the arguments put forward to justify the necessity of adopting it.
And then we will offer our proposals on how to manage state-owned enterprises during the war.
Deputy Minister of Economic Development Denis Kudrin explained the necessity of such innovation risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will prevent remote work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to take the necessary decisions, which may paralyze the company's work.
We agree that such a risk exists, but will he be able to prevent members of supervisory boards from moving to Ukraine?
Imagine a fairly cynical situation, when independent members of the supervisory board (who constitute the majority of the total composition) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be released.
And further, this is likely to lead to the loss of a quorum, necessary for the supervisory board to take any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, as the law stipulates the necessity of conducting a competitive selection, which usually lasts 3-4 months.
Therefore, the proposed draft law 7176 will not be able to protect the possibility of taking decisions by the supervisory board, but rather will lead to this!
Deputy of the Verkhovna Rada, the author of the bill, Dmytro Natakha provides other arguments in its support.
For example, he says: "Many companies, including the defence industrial complex (DIP), need to be relocated" and so "it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information via Zoom from Vienna".
To begin with, there are almost no state-owned enterprises in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
The advisory board is only in the "Ukroboronprom," which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the OPK.
But even in the "Ukroboronprom," according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a non-profit basis.
The general director of "Ukroboronprom" has the full authority of power. By the way, he will also make a decision on the necessity of relocation of any enterprise of the OPK that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not withstand criticism, because the draft law 7176 in general does not introduce any changes to the legislation that regulates the activities of state-owned enterprises of the OPK.
Pan Dmytro, on his Facebook page, also gives arguments that can be categorized as "emotional".
These arguments, as a rule, have nothing in common with increasing the efficiency of state companies and banks, but let's try to disassemble some of them: "Serious foreign experts, at the first word 'war', leave Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time remain members of the supervisory boards of state-owned enterprises in Ukraine with a full salary of several tens of thousands of hryvnias, while Ukraine is actually suffering from war."
First, this is manipulation - most of such members of the supervisory board never lived in Ukraine and only periodically visited it.
Therefore, to say that they are "leaving Ukraine" is, to put it mildly, unfair.
Second, as a result of the pandemic of the coronavirus, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long been resorting to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has been widely used in the practice of the world for a long time, and in absolutely different spheres: business, education, medicine, etc.
It is also not worth forgetting that membership of the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have another job and just the means of electronic communication help them in this.
Third, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
It is interesting why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to members of the supervisory board who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are not in the place of their companies.
To the word, this is far from the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.
Hello. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary accommodation in a family. I have 2 children.

We usually need a passport of one of the adults.
In Boryspil, Vasylkivsky, and Bucha districts of the Kyiv region, which have been liberated from the occupation, a strengthened curfew will be introduced for 2 days.
Direct words of Pavlyuk: "In the populated localities of Bovary, Vishgorodsky and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian forces of defense, the curfew hour is intensified!
Restrictions will be in place in these cities and villages from 6pm on April 2 to 6am on April 5."
Details: According to the head of the oblast VA, at this time it is categorically forbidden to be on the streets of inhabited localities and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go out on the street during the alarm to take shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression ‚Äì to clear and mine the territories.
Omel'nyak called on people who have left these areas not to return home yet.
In the rest of the territory of Kyiv region, the night curfew will be in force daily from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Neither from school did they send me anything, not even a receipt

Serbian defense budget has been growing in geometric progression for several years.
Over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, updating military equipment and acquiring modern systems, rising to 22nd place in the list of the world's most powerful military states.
After the full-scale aggression of Russia against Ukraine, the West took the predictions of a possible aggravation in the Balkans very seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

Soldiers of the regime of Lukashenko detained three Belarusians, 27 and 28 years old, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signaling system under Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
The source: "Radio Svoboda," the Human Rights Center "Viasna," the Chief of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, who is quoted by the state news agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of the Interior of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruisk were detained by the special task force "SOBR" with the use of force.
According to "Viasna", the men resisted arrest and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Another was given medical assistance at the scene.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennai Kazakevich, said that "the acts of terrorism on the railway of RB will be harshly suppressed" by law enforcement officers with the use of weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of Belarusian Railways, an employee of the Baranovichi division of "Belorusian Railways" and the administrator of thematic resources of "Belorusian Railways" in "VKontakte" and "Classmates" Valentin Samasuk.
Where he is now and in what state is unknown, @belzhd_live reports.
At the end of March, more than 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
A reminder: the formation of the BYpol party, announced by the regime of Lukashenko as extremist, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out diversionary attacks on railway transport and infrastructure in Belarus within the framework of the "Peramoga" plan.
Belarusian "railway partisans" are trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine in this way.
It is known that Russia is shipping troops and equipment through Belarus to fight in Ukraine.

US bans investment in Russia and introduces sanctions against Putin's daughters
Together with the G7 and the EU, the United States is introducing new sanctions against the president's daughters, the biggest Russian banks - Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and is banning all new investments in Russia.
This is what the White House website says.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia that is owned by the government, while Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions freeze any of their assets in the US financial system and prohibits US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States introduces a full ban on new investments in Russia.
To this end, the President of the United States, Joe Biden, has signed a new executive order, which includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens, regardless of their location.
This step is based on the decision of more than 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers, such as law and consulting firms," the White House said in a statement.
The third step of new sanctions from the US were restrictions against large Russian state-owned companies in the critical sphere.
This will ban US citizens from operating with these groups and freeze any assets they have in US jurisdiction.
The detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be published on Thursday.
The final part of the package is the full blocking of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and members of the Russian Security Council, including ex-President and Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, and Prime Minister, Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You can drive only to this place, further trip is closed and I will come to you
Can we wash the dishes in the car?
My name is Olga. I worked as a flight attendant for Skyap before the war. My mother is a seamstress of industrial products, and my son Makar is in kindergarten.
We lived very well, and even did not think that we would have to flee, because there was no strength to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
There is hope that someone will take us in for a while (we can pay for a room or an apartment, but it has to be within our means).
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We don't have harmful habits.
We will be grateful for such assistance in this complicated time for us.
After lunch I had one lecture in English and then went to work in the children's room.
I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understands and does everything well.
And I met with Ms Lena and we talked about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She announced from the pool.
It's free swimming.
You can call the school, Kira doesn't answer the phone, doesn't reply, don't know if she got to school.
They are isolating the Russian office: freezing investments and stopping supplies.
But we didn't understand each other.
There are no military in our house.
Our house is located near a military unit and an oil base.
He just helped me because I wouldn't have coped on my own.
I cook delicious, don't ask unnecessary questions and give good advice.
I give myself advice.
It's hard for me, but I understand that I have to go through this stage.
We'll meet in the fourth and I'll tell you everything.
Overall, everything is fine.
How often do you clean?
I clean every week.
Unfortunately, I don't have a program, but I will try to figure it out.
I dreamed of being a teacher.
My girls can't move anywhere at the moment so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you to please let me know if you hear anything about housing.
I would be happy to rent a flat with a decent girl.
If possible, please let me know.
I'm not going to lie.
Thank you in advance.
Dear Natalia, 54 years old. Write down the exact address and how much the courses cost.
I think it would be better for you to make copies of our passports, they contain all the information.
I didn't change my last name, it's the same as my birth name :)
Good day, Mr. Riarde! Excuse me, I didn't see you. I'm doing it right now and will send it to you immediately.
We will go to the medical commission
In other words, Ani should work this hour in another day.
Which day is better for her to come early? (Is there a day with a little more work?)
I'll listen tomorrow, the Internet is not working well. Goodbye.
What will you do today?
Thank you ... a little found with things, but ... there was nothing with the technology.
Both beginners know nothing but the alphabet
Nothing happens.
Is it possible on Monday 25.04.?
You can take children with you, and there are enough toys here :)
Knew about the Tatars
Well, I'm either very naive or very in love, but I'm coming up with something with these dollars.
We will somehow do it.
But how it will be paid, please, no credits.
Write to me directly and I'll help.
You are my partner, or I am not your partner.
I don't know.
Do you need to take those clothes with you?
Today is not my day. The blinds in the foyer are broken. In the morning. Now in the evening.
Something from you came, I don't see it
I am also very sad.
I'll remind you about the fact later
Do you only have a father who speaks Russian?
What day does your colleague want to do the cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I'm sorry I'm distracting you from your work.
Good evening, I cannot not share with you. There is a message from Mariupol for your son - he is alive and in service.
Raju enjoys reading about Joe Dispenza, who conducts scientific experiments on the impact of external factors and the formation of new neurons
Journalist of the "1+1" TV channel Nataliya Nagornaya published in the morning of April 12 a video recording, which was sent to her by the military of the 36th brigade of marine infantry from Mariupol.
There, soldiers say they have run out of ammunition to take part in the fighting, and the mountain of the wounded.
They said that "time is money."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate marine brigade, which is defending Mariupol, published an appeal to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 may be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not communicate with the fighters for two weeks.
Social media expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valery Zaluzhny, assured that the command was in contact with the Mariupol garrison defenders, and that the details of the defensive operation should not be subject to public discussion.
Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the "Azovstal" plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
In the evening of April 11, Russian occupants threw an unknown poisonous substance onto Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of the "Aydar" battalion, Andrei Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons against the "Aydar" battalion, which is defended by the "Aydar" regiment.
Thank you, I will adjust to you. That would be very good.
The situation and so far, we remain here.
2 hours of driving )) walks, mom to the shops and back)!
It's not an important matter
She forgot what she was doing here.
The squadron of Czechüá®üáø drones started flying over Ukraineüá∫üá¶ today.
Almost 50 professional dronesüöÅ will be used for detection, and some of them - for direct destruction of the enemyüí•.
Two Carpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" sent to Ukraine yesterday thanks to the deputy mayor of Mukachevo Vladimir Labutenko.
Today, their inter-mountain friends, led by the head of the settlement council and coordinator Vasyl Shcherb, delivered drones for the purpose: special units of the Ukrainian army received them in various cities where fighting is underway.
In order to use the drones in the most effective and safe way - their current location remains a secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic say they have no plans to stop: in the coming days, Ukraine will receive many more interesting "gifts" that will help destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Didn't worry, everything is fine. I love sweet, but I can do without it.
I'm worried we won't make it. A lot of baggage.
I will soon return to Ukraine, then work
OK. If everything is all right, I agree.
I will do my best, but if there are any problems, I will write to you, if possible?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in the village elder in Yivov, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no housing
Maybe she will be happy and her mood will improve
I had my phone repaired today.
And I think that today I am still frozen on the street.
I drank the medicine and tea and felt worse, but not critically.
I am also sorry, but it is better to meet when I am healthy.
When you have time, send me music that you like.
I like your musical conquests üòä
Mom and dad need to listen.
You'll find him somewhere near the carriage of your little brother.
It was cooler and raining here today. Tomorrow it will be warm.
But it's not the damaged buildings that matter, it's the people who are being oppressed by the occupants
In Herson, the occupants mocked the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial in Herson on the street of Perekopsky.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the European Union flag, smashed the panels with photographs of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupants tore down portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the killed participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They took down the flag.
Good morning, thank you children for the carol, we do not have such a tradition so we did not know, we only gave the children chocolate and cookies, perhaps something else was needed to give
Who to talk to, if anything.
And I live in a dormitory. There will be twelve people here, and then we go to work.
Hello a little better.
It was clear today.
Even today there is sleeping there.
Therefore, we have already made great progress.
I'll definitely bring cookies again!
I don't have the strength to do them today.
Since I'm pushing away from days and time in which there's work to be done cleaning the apartment after guests, I can probably say April month because I already have a rough cleaning schedule.
In May - I can say approximately at the end of April or the beginning of May.
Just asked if you have anything to say about it.
Hello, world, I'm sorry it took me so long to reply, I've been cooking dinner and taking a nap.
If you don't mind, I could come today?)
or we will meet after your arrival)
He is humble, he has been learning a lot recently. I understood that it was very important for him in life
Hello) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to be working with people at such a high level.
Today I had a lesson with a woman who is the director of the regional economy department.
She was very pleased with my work.
Gryshko behaved well in the interrogation.
On Monday I will bring confirmation of employment as well as cash payment for the hay.
I'm working from Friday.
I do nothing all day and sleep (and drink a lot of water üòÇ)
If you go to the doctor tomorrow, I will go with you, if possible.
I will bring another analysis.
and not have to drive again
The downspout is clogged and doesn't drain well. It needs a plumber. It needs to be adjusted.
That's all there is
Could you please send me your correct email address?
I would like to invite you to the course of Czech language, which you registered for.
And do they feed the children there or do you have to bring your own?
And now, a question for you.
If you need help, write.
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn't want people to think we were doing this for money, so we started it from the very beginning.
But for online filling me it was not enough two points:
I will rest and recharge. Gathering strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Best regards
üòÑüòçWhat a great idea. I'll watch the video now. It will be good because the whole family will be painting.
The Karazin University calls on employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Stick to official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who stayed in Ukraine also helps the army.
She gathered several works for her portfolio.
After the holidays, the Internet will be restored.
I wanted to be your backup designer.
As long as I'm not at work, it's a holiday for me
Deployment of the headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state."
The text reads: "It is not ruled out that the Russian Federation's armed forces will carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Moldovan Pridnestrovian region with the aim of accusing Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive grouping of forces for actions on the Slaviansk direction.
It is likely that the occupants will try to resume the offensive in the near future.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personnel, weapons and equipment for participation in combat operations on the territory of Ukraine.
The preparation of weapons and military equipment is carried out at the 60th separate motorized infantry brigade (Monastyrshchyna) in the permanent deployment point of the 5th Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that this weaponry will be transferred to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to restore losses among the personnel of the battalion tactical group, a battalion of the 36th Independent Motor Rifle Brigade (Borzya, Zabaykalsky Krai) is carrying out a call-up of military service personnel from the brigade.
A special problem arises for the enemy when it comes to staffing drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The withdrawal of the selected personnel is planned for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the opponent will continue to attack transport infrastructure in Ukraine in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the sites of combat operations.
Specified units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in Brest and Gomel regions.
On the Slobozhanskyi direction, separate subdivisions of the 6th Army of the General Staff and the coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkov, and the artillery continues to shell individual districts of the city.
Air reconnaissance of the terrain is ongoing on the Izium direction in order to reveal the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this, the enemy uses the BPLA "Orlan-10".
Using forces of two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to make a breakthrough in the directions of the populated areas of Dovgene and Dimitrivka, but did not have success and retreated to the previously occupied positions.
On the Donetsk direction, the enemy is concentrating its efforts on taking control of the populated localities of Popasna, Rubizhne, Lower and Novobakhmutovka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault operations in the area of Zolote, without success.
In the city of Mariupol, the occupants are continuing the assault with artillery and aviation in the areas of the "Azovstal" plant and the sea port.
The enemy carried out artillery attacks on the positions of Ukrainian troops in the villages of Vysokopillia, Trudolubivka and Mar‚Äôianske.
Over the past 24 hours, the defenders of Ukraine have repelled four attacks of the enemy in the territory of Donetsk and Lugansk regions and destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six automotive vehicles and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Do you not understand your thoughts?
We usually try to hurry up, but I doubt
And you, how do you want to sleep, and I hold you.
Do you not want me to come?
If you don't want to see me today, tell me, I'll understand)
Thank you. We don't watch TV at home, let alone 1+1. We don't need to be set up :)
I turn on the TV exclusively to listen to the Czech language.
Today is the last day of my monthly package :)
Can we do this by phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery
I understand that I can prepare materials in this area.
I ask her. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she already gives us so many cookies.
We will meet with my father later, for sure üôèüèª
I read the announcement in Facebook, probably Google wrote something about itüèµÔ∏è. I think the number of the phone is enough.
Good morning, we have taken your things, but is there anything small we can bring you in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If the director agrees, I can start going to work next week because tomorrow I plan to go to the employment office in the afternoon to submit documents (if possible, because there are huge queues) and on Saturday it will rain :)
I'm looking for a team at the start, I really liked chemistry at school, I'm studying Czech to know it perfectly so I can work at Tesla.
Old friends and not very, friends, with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends in spirit and mind.
Now it is hard times that have come to you.
Over the last month, I've spoken to many of you.
Your life, which was never easy, turned upside down, just as the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilt and shame over the actions of your country towards your neighbors.
Because of what you are doing to Ukraine in your name.
Over some of you, activists, there has long been a threat hanging over you, and you were preparing for the final blow.
At the beginning of March I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memorial".
We'll tell you a bit later ‚Äì as usual, Sasha replied, laconically. Now, after the search, we are walking around the ruins.
Others ‚Äì cultural figures, artists, critics, writers ‚Äì were struck by the sudden collapse of your crumbling world.
Nobody likes Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, and most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: except for a very few of you ‚Äì those who worked in the "Memorial", in the "New Newspaper", on "Echo of Moscow", in "Medusa", and in the organization of Navalny and in a number of other places ‚Äì how many of you did anything at all to resist this regime?
Apart from taking part in rallies when they were still taking place.
Also read the column by Russian journalist "Late to hide, late to speak"
And if so, are you confident that your sense of shame and guilt - is not just an abstraction?
Maybe they were provoked by your long indifference to what was happening around you, your apathy and passive complicity, which now, no doubt, weigh heavily on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a brief period when you had a certain amount of freedom and democracy - disorderly, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was not better than 1917.
Why every time a revolution finally happens to you, are you ultimately gripped by such a strong fear of disorder that you seek salvation behind the king, be it Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, it still seems safe around him. Why?
Indeed, there were mistakes.
Instead of seizing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Stasi files, you diverted your energies to building a monument to Dzerzhinsky - and allowing the KGB to lie low, regroup, reform and seize power in the country.
When you were faced with the choice between looting the country and bringing the communists back, you didn't fight for the possibility of a third option - and meekly accepted the looting.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, marking the end of mass protests for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then came Mr Putin. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with the terrorists and boost the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you either voted for it or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started equating Chechnya with earth again, most of you squinted at this.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya at that time, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation" and saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Kazar-Yurt, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I returned to Moscow and had fun with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of innocent civilians, the killing of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of their dead comrades to their families.
You said to me: "Get lost, Chechnya bores us." I remember those words very well.
In response, I got angry: "Friends, it's not my Chechnya, it's your Chechnya.
It's your country, not mine.
I'm just a dumb foreigner here.
It's your government bombing one of your cities and killing your citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know.
Then came the mid-zeroes economic boom, fueled by rising oil prices and Mr. Putin's willingness to look the other way as some stolen money stayed in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have become well-off, some have got rich, and even the poorest of you have bought new homes and found better jobs.
Prices rose, but so what?
Moscow was shining and sparkling from the snow.
When they killed several opposition activists - Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, that was as far as it went.
When after two terms Putin passed the presidency to Medvedev and took his place as prime minister, you, as I see, barely noticed it.
When after a few months in power Medvedev's Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or looked the other way.
I met several of you in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbek or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I recognize that it is unlikely that we in the West have done much of anything.
Some annoyance, some sanctions; but what significance did it have that Russia was blatantly violating international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and domestic market was on offer?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the hard 1990s, it was the most important.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, finally woke up.
When Putin again exchanged places with Medvedev and took up the presidency, as before, many of you decided that this was too much and took to the streets in protest.
The name Navalny became a byword, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually realised with horror that it was losing ground.
After that, he struck back.
First there were alternative actions, then repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some got huge terms.
What could we do?
I feel it so often and still do.
The state is so strong, and we are so weak.
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Take a look at what they did two years ago.
Infuriated by the pro-Russian president who deceived their European hopes, they once seized Maidan - and never left it.
They put up a tent camp completely on their own and got ready for a resolute defense.
When the police came and tried to demolish it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, iron bars and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, protesters attacked.
Many were killed, but they won.
The fugitive was Yanukovych, and the Ukrainians returned democracy to themselves, the right to freely choose leaders and kick them out if they do a bad job.
The Maidan was very unpleasant for Putin.
It was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he seized Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but it did little good.
And how many of you were delighted?
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Out of nowhere came a new myth, and a lot of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly returned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It's hard for me to find a reason because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of my friends who remained mostly kept quiet.
We are not interested in politics, you said.
And you hide new ones in books, films, catalogues, IKEA and parks, brand new after the restoration the mayor of Moscow began in 2012 - with their binoculars, general-purpose vayfay and hipster cafes.
Indeed, Donbass is far away, but Moscow is so beautiful ‚Äì it only gets better.
You have turned your attention to Syria.
Were there terrorists there?
I don't give a damn about ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it then in an interview because, I supposedly knew nothing about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw with my own eyes how state snipers cold-bloodedly shot my children's peers in the streets of Khmelnytskyi.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers have been there, who began bombing thousands of peaceful residents in 2015, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Undoubtedly, many of you are familiar with the words of pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
At first they came for the socialists, but I kept silent ‚Äì for I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the union members, but I kept my mouth shut - because I'm not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was nobody left who could say anything in my defence."
How many of you spoke about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did it.
But most remained silent.
Some are actually saying it now ‚Äì for example, Dmytro Hluhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipr and others.
Most allow themselves to talk to the outside world, some - from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking to end up in a new GULAG or join forces with Navalny.
As for others, you know best where you live.
That is why, I am confident, you understand: when Putin is done with the Ukrainians - or, as it seems, very likely if he does not - he will come after you.
Dear friends,  For all of you, my friends: for those who have been brave, but mostly on their own, coming out to the protests, but soon will have a more serious term.
For every thousand of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social networks (even if only by a black square in Instagram) or who expressed themselves in private conversations with colleagues at work.
Times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given for just an anecdote are long gone - and now they are probably waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you? Who will remain?
The example of the Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - scares the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight it.
And that mind, motivation and courage can stop it, however gory its advantage on paper.
Considering all of this, few in Russia are aware of it, let alone that a war is going on at all.
But you, my friends, well know what is happening now.
You read foreign news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine, with whom you maintain contact.
And Putin knows you know.
So be prepared.
You understand what is going on.
A good life in exchange for your silence came to an end.
Your elections are just a formality, your laws, if not repressive, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, there are no more independent media outlets, your economy is being destroyed faster than I can write this, you have no credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights remain.
Now, Mr Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your agreement, your obedience.
And if you don't give him that, he may either try to run away, or he may be killed.
I doubt you'll see another version.
And there is still one more.
Which will eventually topple this regime.
And perhaps, in the circumstances, you will need less from us than you think.
Consider this.
The spark will not come from you: through the economic collapse that is engulfing Russia, it is most likely to flare up in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices rise and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will come out onto the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if every city comes out to the protests just by itself, as it has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them one by one.
There needs to be organization and coordination. The crowd needs to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical instrument - the internet, which can be restricted but which still works and which can be worked on almost in any circumstances.
The organization of Navalny was destroyed, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.
You are many, you are millions.
Moscow police may deal with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly with a hundred thousand.
If it goes over 300,000, it will be staggering.
Will it be necessary to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when the time comes?
After everything he made them go through in Ukraine, after everything he made them do?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel the familiar fear; those of you with children will fear for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
I too was afraid there.
Taking the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you that this is what happens to those who dare to disregard their master, those who dare not only to ask for freedom, but really to seek to win it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son cracks a joke in a computer game ‚Äì and is arrested; your daughter expresses anger online ‚Äì and is arrested; your close friend makes a mistake ‚Äì and dies in a Syrian cell, beaten by police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years - and it will only get worse, increasing in both scale and scope.
So you have a choice to make. If you do nothing, you know what will happen.
Act with cold blood, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were at the lesson on Friday and were told we could come on Monday
We'll be home in the evening.
What do you think of me as a press secretary?
How often do you go to a fancy restaurant for dinner?
Once in a while I go to a fancy restaurant for dinner.
I'll try to explain everything to her)
That's how we liked it very much and we wanted to do something better.
She was in a room with a lot of people. She was tired energetically.
I feel bad, cough, fever, hoarse voice, weakness and headache.
I have to go to work.
We have already done this, but said that those who registered in April will receive money only at the end of the month.
On Thursday we need a permit and we are going to the doctor with the children.
But at night I got a letter from a woman who liked my work and wanted something from me in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her and will definitely inform you.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building my career, spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a complicated psychological, responsible, intellectual work in which I completely failed.
It's very bad to lose time, but it's life experience.
In my personal life I am communicative, but I am a monogamist and I take questions about marriage seriously.
There was a man I was supposed to marry, but he died of a heart problem.
I think that for creating a family people should love, respect and trust each other.
So far, I haven't seen that.
Good day. Where in Iglau can I buy pastry forms (paper or silicone)?
Great, thank you for the tip, I'll put it in the application right now.
She has a broken leg in a cast, a broken wrist set in plaster, a pram lying on its back, and a screaming baby
Mr Reihard, please excuse me for disturbing you out of working hours.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to the game room to see Natalia today.
She had an unpleasant situation.
But when the children went home, one mother refused to take her child, saying that she had come to look at the things and to help put them away in that room with the clothing, and that Mr. Valery had opened up our children's room until 7:00 p.m. yesterday.
Is it really so?
The working time of the room is until 16:00.
And ultimately it is our responsibility.
But my Internet is very slow.
Good day, we are all right) Kolya is working, the invitations were filled yesterday, and I studied with the seniors before the exam in the gymnasium.
The hardest to untangle is the geometry.
On Saturday Vladimir helped us.
Vika studies universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We are very grateful for the apartment
I thought you didn't fill it out.
We will try to collect the maximum amount by the end of the week to calculate
The situation with the Russian invasion - briefing by the adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Alexei Arestovich (10.04.2022).
