The big return of Czech maltsters is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a tough period in his career in recent months, returns to the NHL.
The 33-year-old Plzeň native will be on the bench and will soon have the chance to score a goal.
The former goalie of Litvínov, Plzeň or Russian Chelyabinsk injured himself in the preparation for the NHL in October last year.
Exactly halfway through the game with Vegas, he was substituted and to date has not played at an NHL rink.
The incident happened at a moment when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one post to another.
Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury, Denver announced early October.
His return to the net in the NHL eventually stretched to more than two months.
On Sunday afternoon US time he was called up from the farm where he had caught four ducks and showed his old form.
In V AHL, 94.5% of the votes were cast.
Plzeň native wants to finally make it and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In the last season he had problems with his groin and in the shortened pandemic season he did not play a single game.
V NHL "Francík" played 36 games, his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles puts Camille in a Santa hat, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as their Christmas wish.
Prince Charles also shared his wishes, using a photograph of him helping his wife Camilla to put on her veil.
The British news agency BBC informed about it on its website.
Wishes are sent to friends, colleagues and benefactors with whom they work.
Photography was created somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color and princess Charlotte also has dresses.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same shorts and blazer as Princes George and Louis.
Who took the photographs, William and Kate did not say, and it is not even clear exactly when they were taken.
The royal family posed for a photograph, which was intended as a Christmas card, in front of a stack of hay in their rural home in Norfolk.
The photo, which serves as a Christmas wish, was also published by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured the moment in June at Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a veil on his face, helps Camille put on her veil tinted with light-colored dresses.
Slavia promised Berbrovi million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Criminalists in the current corruption case allegedly worked on the assumption that the accused former chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, had promised a million crowns from Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The server efotbal.cz informed him that he got access to part of the police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that they did not commit any act of corruption.
The server published transcripts of police wiretaps, in which Slavia figures mainly in the form of its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who was dismissed from the club in the summer after a string of poor results.
According to the file, the former influential official of the red-and-white party was in frequent contact both with Berber and with Roman Rogoz, the former sports director of then second league club Vyšehrad, who is also a suspect in the case.
Criminalists are said to have worked on the assumption that Slavia Prague had promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the team SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police organ had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-crown bribe from the officials of SK Slavia Prague for winning the league, the server wrote in its verdict.
O later met with Berbr not only with Nezmarem, but also with Slavia president Tvrdík.
It is not possible to find out from the database whether the police are still working on this information.
Tvrdík denied any corrupt practices.
In 2015 to 2017 we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in any unlawful conduct, we have not tried to influence the judges in violation of the rules of fair play, and we have not provided any financial compensation to anyone in this connection," Tvrdik said for Seznam Zprávy.
In addition to this, Nezmar unjustly insults some former Slavia players with dark skin and also praises his former boss Tvrdík.
Kauzu's alleged interference in matches through the referees sparked a police intervention in mid-October in several places, including the FAČR headquarters in Prague.
The highest-ranking person involved in the affair is Berbr, who no longer features in any football roles.
In the middle of January, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad Rogoz, he was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and BVP are larping the Cold War.
The guns will be new, but of a fundamentally worse type (artillery crews will have to work from the armoured cabins and carry ammunition manually without protection).
Cars - Toyota Hi-Lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armoured vehicles - at a reasonable level, in addition, it has been possible to get rid of Prague V3S even in specialist units.
Aircraft: combat-ready, but at the end of the lease, transport - very small with a short range, but modern.
Drony - few and small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we produce and export them)
PVO: medium - Cold War, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have that story.
Honitbu is located near the city.
The river was full of nutria and they were doing damage to the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other bank of the river.
I didn't want to run a brothel, so I just sat back and carried on typing.
I was hoping it would go away before something came out, but of course the cat had other ideas.
I watched her for 40 metres before deciding to shoot.
The fisherman, Chudák, almost fell over, he was walking around with his head on all sides, so I called him and said it was a fox.
When I left the property it was in a state.
In other words, I am a man.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would take a lot of coincidences for something to happen, probably you would see it on thermal vision, which practically everyone has today.
So, put the valuable things in the visible place, hide the things you don't want to be stolen, and have peace of mind.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Intravenous respirators are significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, which is responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks and respirators closest to coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
Server iRozhlas compared purchases made by individual ministries and found that during one day the amounts spent on respirators varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why were prices changing so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
Why did others buy the train?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to the editor of the iRozhlas server Dominika Kubištová.
I admire soldiers and the army (perhaps I am not affected by memories of the CSLA, which affected the older generation), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't have big stocks of technology, which could be used for training, we actually have no modern technology at all for the existing professionals, and on top of that modern technology is always more complicated, so the abilities of reserves will be eroded rapidly over time.
In terms of modern-day conventional conflicts, where anyone can be involved, they will play out very quickly, and no-one will have time to train anyone again.
In the end, reserves/territorial defense are of great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where it is necessary to lead a mass guerrilla war and it is an express necessity to frighten the enemy.
It will be possible to fight only in a conflict of such a scale and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not have a suitable geography for that.
mainly because we don't have individual skills.
It's not the worst.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it.
To make such a situation, that you look like a fool, when you miss an empty goal for 2 minutes, drives into the attack alone with 2 or even 3 Swiss players and says "What do you think, what do you think will happen now?"
Naturally, they don't treat him like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "to provoke the defender" is so terrible that I am really surprised when I see that our attacker managed to get past one of the opponent's players.
First butterflies
The Covid-19 pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major turning point in the following weeks.
According to statistical models, the number of deaths in hospitals will still increase for some time and the pandemic equation has a new unknown: the Omicron variant, which is likely to spread faster than the Delta variant currently prevailing.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course of the disease, how much it helps vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired from previous illness.
However, this week there was an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side: the possibility of treatment.
The Czech Republic has received a new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
I also had to take the drug Paxlovid from the company Pfizer, which reports an 85 percent success rate from previous results.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming medication.
As was mentioned, the first domestic patients will receive molnupiravir from Merck.
The company was the first to finish the trial because the drug had been in development for some time, with the aim of finding an appropriate treatment for equine viral diseases on the South American continent.
In this research, it is often forgotten that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and openly share their views.
Eastern Europeans, and we Czechs in particular, are used to talking about "how our beaks have grown".
Viz does research, asking people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the West, they'll tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help, and how the Czechs are all racists.
And they vote for the AfD.
He's afraid of cancel culture, telling this to the public means losing your job and being media lynched.
Pakistan looks bad in polls, west good, east bad.
Ale really finds out what people think.
In France, Le Pen and Zemmour, both have over 20%.
We know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
Identical for the sake of filming units so soldiers don't have to learn where everything is again, so all objects are the same.
One is Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
Sranda is of the opinion that Serbia did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for safety reasons or because of the speed of deployment.
In those underground shelters (there are two in every horse chestnut tree) only the heads of the rockets were preserved, not the whole thing as they say.
If it was necessary to use this weapon, a special unit was sent which took away the barrel and mounted it on some kind of carriage.
In addition to the museum's horse chestnut, the rest are in a desolate state.
At the second grade of the primary school we had a classmate called Cigán, we were together for four years.
It was completely on a roll, did good impersonations, often went too far, but it was such a great mascot.
Everyone knew him, he often went there and wanted to explain something, he was rarely late, he went there regularly, he devoted himself to sports with us, he did not steal anything, not even mobile phones, he went there dressed properly.
He cycled to school in the countryside, did all sorts of monkey business, but was always at ease, perhaps never any prankster.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, who are Roma, started in the same class, in different grades.
Shortly afterwards, the teacher was attacked, the police were regularly summoned, threats were made and other students were intimidated.
I occasionally sell something on an ad (old things, things I don't need etc.) and I have sold to the Roma community before - they always had money, they didn't try to rip me off, they communicated in a calm manner.
Once I sold a car like that and the guy called me after a month and said he had changed his mind...
I say to myself that I am not a racist - it's one thing if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or whatever, but as long as they behave as they should in polite society (works, functions, doesn't beat women, just normal behaviour).
Just as someone comes, they pull their hand, empty flats and houses, there's only disorder around them, they cause problems... so one way or another, what colour it has is one thing, but it will annoy me.
I have no problem with African migrants, but if they get involved here, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, but at least English), respect our culture.
If you believe in Allah, it's one for me as long as you respect my traditions and culture.
Young woman died in a car accident on Prachatice
A young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and despite resuscitation efforts, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries at the scene, said Právu spokeswoman Zuzana Fajtlová.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who picked up the girl.
An 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot car was travelling in the direction of the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov, probably, and for as yet undetermined reasons, drove into the oncoming lane in a bend.
After a collision, the Peugeot Octavia ended up on the roof, outside the lane of traffic, said spokeswoman for the South Bohemian police, Štěpánka Schwarzová.
Young Peugeot driver suffered serious injuries in the accident.
It was a multitude of injuries and he remained trapped in the car.
He had to be provided with emergency pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the Czech-Budějovice hospital in a stable condition, emergency responder Fajtlová stated.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor injuries to his ribs and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to customers from countries outside the EU, who often do not provide information
Lukáš Neuheisel orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects trading cards.
It's usually just a few dollars, say, ten dollars, where it's still worth bringing in from Japan, where the post is often free, says the collector.
From October, ordering small parcels became slightly more expensive, and he has to add VAT and send the data for customs clearance to the post.
He receives an email saying that customs officials are expecting a package to arrive.
Pak has to fill in the data on the consignment, and if the DPH did not include the trader in the sale, the customs office measures him for the total amount for the consignment and the transport.
If the addressee does not arrange for customs clearance himself, the total amount must also include the fee for the carrier.
According to Lukáš Neuheisel, the whole process is not complicated.
I peel off one or two of the sticky labels, insert two pages and I'm done.
For me it is usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all deliveries are successful.
Due to new customs regulations, the number of international parcels delivered in Prague fell from 60,000 to 15,000 a day.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not react to calls for information that are necessary to complete customs proceedings.
Currently there are 30,000 items in the international post that we have to process.
If people filled in all the information that is needed and filled it in time, we would be roughly halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Solution to inflation
Viz title, how would you suggest solving the current inflation?
Currently we are at 9.9% inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What would you like me to do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
Do we need to see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland?
What do you think, that it will happen, what is inevitable with it?
Prices are rising faster than wages, it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford the basics, especially energy.
How many have you received (who is the employee)?
This year I added 2% in gross, which is a slap in the face, but fortunately I have a similar income from my business, which I run during my employment.
Someone was able to explain to me why the perpetrators of proven violence are sent behind bars for only six months?
I just can't take it anymore, how the court can send such an animal behind bars for only 6 months just for doing it again and again.
Six months is nothing compared to the fact that its victim will be traumatised for several years, negatively affecting their sexual relationships and overall relationships.
And that the victim of rape need not ever try to forget.
Does this include potential future reports of rape?
Hrobu man "blew up" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from Hrobo unwillingly helped the guards to arrest his nationwide sought girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom a warrant to arrest was issued.
He called her himself.
He did it with a click.
First he addressed the passerby and invented a story that he had been robbed.
Guards who answered an emergency call arrived at the scene and were stunned when the supposedly "mugged" man told them he had made it all up to get the guards to come to the scene.
In reality, he just wanted to advise the guards on how to notify the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his companion, the guards discovered that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, nationwide, and a warrant for her arrest was issued.
The case is being investigated by the Czech Republic.
An honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally share the opinion that Slavs are not ethnically or culturally the same anymore, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Of course I agree, it's a shame Churchill couldn't get the US to liberate Prague :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question, whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence just because it might potentially bring some benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case to be for real.
Today, with Pascal, I cannot agree that there exists an estimated ten thousand different religions in the world, if we do not count the heretics.
Which god or gods should a person choose?
I would say it's quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you if you believe in another.
And in the tenth, that there is no other God but Jehovah.
After all, in such a case, it is more rational to withhold belief in any god, rather than risk choosing the wrong one of thousands and sending myself to hell or somewhere like that for it?
Others: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserve.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months for one) and under the guidance of professionals with practical experience.
If a person leads well, they can get a professional offer.
Something like that would suit everyone in AČR.
Dalo to do in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can talk about it like this: Collaboration between the educational sector and industry is constantly increasing, companies are fishing in schools and there is some sort of migration of workforce from educational institutions to workplaces.
Not only during adolescence, but this process takes place constantly, each of us is constantly learning something new, switching from one field to another, etc.
Similar interpenetration should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way to build some kind of relationship between a citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that Russia will never invade here.
It will be funny when you consider NATO as something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if a crisis occurs.
No pleasure for you.
It takes just one election in the US to screw their budget and the whole NATO goes bankrupt.
The English exchange us for Russian trash, the Germans exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already once shown that they are enough to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that functions as a guarantor of independence is a well-armed army and a population that is able to master the military technology of their time.
Today, every teenager knows how to pilot a remotely controlled vehicle.
We don't need the border fortifications, they are an anachronism today, but the teenager playing with a remote-controlled toy will win.
How to survive a crab tsunami
Unwrap presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're home with bags and fillings?
This "waste" is again used by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
This led to the creation of a map of trade-ins, showing where your old phone will end up.
Not only about Christmas.
All outer materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
It is damage to treat them like one-off waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper packaging to the participating shop (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project includes almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste created and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
Individual shops welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, and also saved money, because cardboard for packaging has become 50% more expensive in recent times.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers this also strengthens their brand.
One such business is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-drugs and eco-cosmetics.
Krabice and packaging materials are delivered to Popůvek near Brno by individuals who accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies, with whom we have agreed regular collections of postponed cardboard.
We use everything when packing orders from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we are creating a more considerate world.
Our aim is to preserve the sources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz application not only shows collection points for packaging materials.
It serves as a search engine, if you need to get rid of anything (dispose of your household waste, take your expired medication, old tyres, worn-out electrical appliances, batteries, light bulbs and more).
All waste can then end up in the right place, and reusable items will find their second home.
In total, the map of the project includes more than 100,000 such places.
Slowly but surely, there are being added collection yards, re-use centres, containers for textiles, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find uses for things that would otherwise be waste, adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the app from the group Ukliďme Česko.
I find it sad that in today's day and age, technology has become so simple and user-friendly that children who use computers or phones play games on them, but they don't learn basic computer skills in the process.
Recently there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of components on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple applications for photos or, in fact, mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying filesystem with its components and put everything on one screen in the application.
Quietly, if they use technology from an early age, but above all, if they learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU - starting in January - and it was magnificent.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for protecting Europeans – at work, in the street – and mentioned so many events that it will take half a year to attend them all.
The French politicians are happy about it and so are the voters.
Macron's supporters on the right and the left agree on little, but just on Europe.
France will have new presidential elections in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities.
The French leader also mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticize Macron, saying that he is spreading pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In reality, this is an attempt to rewrite history.
Far-right candidate for the French presidency, Éric Zemmour, is just now travelling around France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is having great success with this.
Let's take Macron's idea seriously and don't ignore what is happening in France.
Nebyla by zapotřebí?
Students in European countries learn history as the story of us versus them, never as the story of the whole.
Spaniards, Frenchmen, Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
If they don't have an enlightened conductor, they won't find out what the wider context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "mice" did not win.
The film, which returns to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won awards for direction and best actress for Jasna Duričić.
At last year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held on to first place in the audience rating.
The best actor in Berlin went to Anthony Hopkins for his role in Father.
I'm not that young, I'm not that healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having a cold/being congested" for a couple of days I had heartburn and not much of an appetite for smoking...
It was worse than the common cold.
I have no appetite with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I don't claim that everyone is like that)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas double issue, which will come out on December 20, will include a traditional literary supplement.
Together with her, cultural tips will also emerge.
For you, our subscribers, we are adding something extra for this digital edition, so that you will have time to buy the books as Christmas gifts, if you wish.
Prosaic texts that follow on from the preceding Sellier & Petříček Bellot collection.
Another portion of observing the world and describing everyday things with an unusual poetic attentiveness, depth and atmosphere.
In his second novel, photographer Šesták tried to capture the essence of a small town and the Czech way of life.
The story of returning to the roots, which turns out to be just an illusion.
The bohemian and comparatist transfers the fairy tale of the Red Cabbage into the backdrop of a contemporary village.
Its depiction of brutality exceeds the gory fables of yore and graduates into horror via emotional vacuum.
After all, the road back to instincts is shorter than people are willing to admit.
The author, in his last novel, tells a much less sentimental story about returning from exile than we have become used to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to have a common life.
Pancakes are starting to run according to the new timetable, and in some places the transport company will change
From Sunday, trains will start running according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet will replace České dráhy.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, or possibly the route as well.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the rails.
S began selling tickets during the autumn.
Czech Railways plans to operate an average of 6,783 passenger trains a day in its new timetable, including a daily average of 4,780 long-distance trains.
Vlaky will cover around 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
Trains will also run alongside domestic services within the new timetable to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company is introducing dozens of new trains together with the new timetable.
The main new feature will be the InterJet trains, which will run on the Prague to Cheb lines.
Other new trains will be operated by the transport company in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
Train operators also traditionally increase ticket prices by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
Trains take inflation into account when setting their fares every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 line from Ústí nad Labem to Mělník, Nymburk and Kolín.
The transport company will replace Czech Railways here after its success in the ministry of transport competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 trains on the route, eight in each direction.
Further changes involve long-distance trains between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at the stations of Havlíčkův Brod, Ždár nad Sázavou and Kolín from Sunday.
Leo Express has preserved its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the transport company was trying to keep disruptions to a minimum, even during planned works.
Without major changes, the operation of trains by Arrivy and other operators should continue.
Drivers are also exchanged on some regional lines.
Passengers, for example, can expect changes in Czech Lípa, where the Czech Railways trains will be replaced by the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk.
Passengers will also be able to use a single ticket on the train for the second year.
Like Czech Railways, their price will increase by 3.2 percent due to inflation.
I must disagree.
Do we not learn from the other side's point of view?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to suffer, how they died.
In life I have not heard a lecture from the point of view of the slave owners or from that time when nobody defended this.
Nobody tells you in school that blacks often sold other blacks into slavery and that they were often the worst slave traders.
No-one at school teaches you that colonisers often bought land from Indians, everywhere they just tell you how brutally we, the Europeans, exterminated them, while they were exterminating each other a long time ago.
For some time I also spent in the USA, directly at schools, both in northern schools and in southern schools.
I was surprised that someone would deliberately omit facts, but I had already heard that this was happening and in my opinion, this is a problem (in Japan, for example, the war crimes from WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was that history is not black and white, and that we have a tendency to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not interested in people's feelings, it's just a fact, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at the context of the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do it again.
Mimochodem when we're in those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave-owners are very popular there, on the other hand they had some of their own good successes and it's absurd to reject them.
In addition, the north was not much better, as many people idealize it today.
Some people also forget that not all people in the South were slave owners, and that a lot of things were against them.
This is something I could never imagine happening in Russia, they deliberately omit certain facts, lie and manipulate, and on top of that, our point of view does not exist there (there was even a video on YouTube from TV where someone started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What I found strange at US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of Communism, something that their country had never experienced.
Overall, I came to the conclusion that on some universities it was shocking, those students were too radicalised and those schools were supporting them how many times.
When I imagine that these people will be much older one day, it makes me a little sad that this could be the voice of the majority, because among young people there are and there are in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has long achieved what it set out to achieve and has become radicalised.
In the current situation, those who call themselves feminists are those who have nothing in common with it and ignore the basic biological fact, and this leads to radicalisation on the other side too, when it often leads to resistance even to quite reasonable things.
In addition, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, at the end, I have not met anyone who would blame me for colonialism or slavery.
I met with bad geography, but it was mutual:D
I'm not saying that I wouldn't like it here, but because it's completely pointless according to me.
Am I proud of something I couldn't do myself?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole to be unnecessary, from the point of view of some personal identity.
If I have something in common with people, an interest in the world and shared experiences, not where I was born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
Ten Slovak priest is a real lad, his homilies are more theological than political, but then he always manages to squeeze in something about the coronavirus, that we are all ashamed.
Of course, here is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they have arisen from Catholic modernism and are actually Catholic without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but go to the services of the Hussites, because it is theologically quite similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically valuable functionalist church on the street Botanická.
The Church of St. Michael on Dominikánské náměstí belongs to the Dominicans and they even say mass in Latin there every Sunday at 3 p.m. as they did before Vatican II.
Plaminec from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it over from Austria
Břeclav - Plamínek, which was burnt in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouting for him because of the pandemic of coronavirus did not fly to Vienna this time either, in the morning they took him over from his Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal - Břeclav.
At the border, they took it over.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year and are looking forward to it.
It is a great honor for me that I was chosen, said the scout Amálie Budíková.
While the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, it is now taking place at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing on the parking lot.
Usually, scouts go to Vienna by train.
The spread of the blight across the Czech Republic remains unchanged.
The scouts set out with the Bethlehem light traditionally by train first to Brno, where they hand it over to the bishop of the Diocese of Brno, Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent transportation of light will be handled by scout couriers, who will travel on selected express trains and regular trains.
From there, the light will be taken over by local scouts or volunteers in the stations, who will then spread the flames across the Czech Republic and wherever the rails don't go.
Scouts must comply with the current measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It happens in the same way.
We recommend that both courier teams and organisers of local events wear masks, try to maintain distance, there should be as few as possible, not to sing along with colleagues, simply behave in such a way as to make it as safe as possible, said the spokeswoman for the Bethlehem Light campaign, Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem star, which travels through Europe, was born in Austria in 1986.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and harmony at the same time as the flame.
The Bethlehem light is for believers a symbol of hope, light that triumphs over darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and guides have been dealing with its spread for more than 30 years.
The action is supported by hundreds of volunteers, and the torch is also a symbol of unselfishness and humaneness.
All the actualities, including the list of places where people can go for a smoke, can be found on the web pages www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education so I don't know the fundamentals of economics that would confirm that the dole is bad for the economy, but I don't think that the dole as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (such as the retention of water), healthcare and education make proper use of the money, even though I do not understand why the money is being given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned before - it produces unnecessary products and disturbs the free market and "the natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where there are millions of "XY financed/sponsored by project XY" notices plastered on the walls, and such companies simply do not exist.
This is not support for the company that gives work to x people, this is a brake on development, when this company holds on and takes contracts/employees from other companies, which after its collapse could grow and become more productive.
It is a grave mistake.
Occasionally, even a person who was born in the Internet age can get caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think I'm immune to internet advertising, but then I realise that I've been influenced by it - it's just so ingrained now that people don't even try to defend themselves against it.
For this reason, I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to give a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all just a big scam, as the saying goes - I'd ban the internet if I could.
Yes, I have the feeling that this virus has its roots (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe something just because most people do and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, I'd rather believe something that is less probable, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion which I will defend as being critical thinking."
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
TV channels are following the trend of Christmas films, two hundred of them will have their premiere this year
Los Angeles - Chinese TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen into the trend of Christmas films, and this year they will show their viewers more than 200 in the premiere.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring with the public in recent years and significantly increasing viewership, so these films are being made more and more.
Four times as many Christmas films were made this year than in 2011, and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database, however, included only those films that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in their title, so there will actually be many more Christmas films.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated above all with fairy tales, and internationally popular films such as Home Alone, Love in Heaven or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
The real Christmas card boom, however, only started in 2009, when the American cable television channel Hallmark launched a special film series, the BBC server reminded us.
Her advent calendar, called Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was a huge success.
This year's Christmas station started to entertain its viewers on October 22nd and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Competitor Lifetime has 35 new Christmas films in its programme this year, and streaming platforms such as Netflix are also contributing to the total.
In this wondrous, magical period, it no longer matters what the story is about, it's just important that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background, and it snows," says Brandon Gray, the author of I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies, a book about Christmas films.
For viewers, it's an escape and a way to feel a little calm in the middle of all the holiday madness and madness of the world we've been living in the last couple of years," added Gray.
According to him, for example, the television channel Hallmark uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there's some misunderstanding maybe five minutes before the end of the film, which is resolved nicely and they kiss.
That's always the case, and as long as all the films look the same and have the same atmosphere, people will follow, adds Gray.

Haas will only have one car on track.
In the last race of the season, he wanted to attack a better position from 20th place, which he took in qualifying.
Russian Nikita Mazepin will not take part in the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
He had tested positive for Covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will be on the starting grid, and starting from the back of the grid will be Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, and from the front, Max Verstappen, who will be in a direct fight for the title with Lewis Hamilton.
Mazepin is in reasonable order according to the Haas team, and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita was physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
Now it is in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with the safety of all participants being the ultimate priority," its representatives told formula1.com.
Haas doesn't send a replacement driver, nor can it.
A possible substitute would have to complete qualification or rides in another part of the weekend.

Is Mutace Omikron spreading to the south of Moravia?
Hygiena is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
Actually, we have another suspicion on this variant with another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from ZŠ Adamov has not been proven,“ Ciupek said.
Six cases were reported in the region in one week.
We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant from our six cases – this is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses at the State Institute of Public Health in Prague, said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from one workplace at the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, plus two eleventh graders from ZŠ Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, four asymptomatic course.
No one suspected Omikron to travel abroad
None of the people mentioned had gone abroad, nor had any of their families, nor had there been any contact with anyone who would be staying abroad.
There is no connection between the championships in water polo, said Ciupek.

California limits gun sales.
It wants to proceed like Texas with the ban on abortions.
Governor of California Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of some weapons in the most populous US state using a legal mechanism similar to the one Texas used in its controversial abortion bill.
People who make or sell assault weapons in California would be liable for damages in a lawsuit filed by anyone injured as a result.
Newsom's announcement comes in the wake of a Friday ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that blocked a lower court ruling that would have struck down the Texas law as unconstitutional. The lower court ruling was in line with a nearly 50-year-old Supreme Court precedent that established a nationwide right to abortion about 24 weeks into a pregnancy.
However, the Constitutional Court now did not rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue that arises from the innovative design of the measures.
In this case, the ban was imposed on the public, which the Texan Republicans used to prevent a legal challenge.
“I am outraged by the recent (Thursday) decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which allowed Texas to maintain most of its ban on most abortion services and largely upheld Texas’ maneuver to protect its law,” the California governor said.
If states can now block federal courts from reviewing their laws, California will use this power to protect human life," Newsom continued.
He allegedly entrusted his subordinates to work in cooperation with the state parliament and the minister of justice on measures that would allow representatives of the public to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called "ghost weapons."
These are called homemade weapons, which do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand at least $10,000 (around 220,000 Kč) in damages from anyone who makes, distributes or sells assault weapons, bump stocks or high-capacity magazines in California.
If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then we should do that," the California governor said.
The AP agency reports that California had banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the state's ban as unconstitutional.
Pakliže by now the state would really renew the ban using the Texas template, the words of liberal member of the Supreme Court Sonia Sotomayor would be confirmed, who in her dissenting opinion warned against extending the said legal mechanism to other American states on Friday.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas full immunity from legal challenge and allowed abortion clinics to continue their lawsuits against selected officials in the southern US state.
Every emergency vaccination has a public testing phase, during which it gradually becomes clear how the vaccination scheme will look and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
For example, in Israel, a large-scale study on the effects of four doses is already underway.
According to these studies, in most patients, antibodies increase by a factor of five, which already has a long-term effect on you.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule, just sooner rather than later.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on inactivated virus is to be launched on the market in the near future, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises ten times higher efficiency.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission acted in violation of the law if it used its new powers and stopped payments to Poland due to the dispute over the legal state.
The Commission has already postponed approval of the Polish plan for drawing 3.6 billion euros from the EU budget to revive the economy hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.
It is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism that would allow it to withdraw EU funding from countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
Poland should respond to this bullying by the EU in all matters that require unanimity, said Ziobro, the head of the small Solidarity Poland party, whose votes ensure the current government has a tight majority in the Sejm.
Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which lead to drastic increases in energy prices, added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland suspends its contributions to the EU.
It is unfair towards us that the EU unlawfully withholds funds from the common budget to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
Its stance on EU accession is more radical than that of the ruling party, Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that Polish justice has undergone under Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions because its goal is not a legal state, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing a "political dictate imposed by blackmail and the attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," said Ziobro.
He said Poland should be part of an EU that is based on partnership between sovereign states, not on the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions from Brussels that would limit Poland's sovereignty.
We will never agree that Poland should have the status of a colony, he said.
And confess to that... At Lidl we have one type of cheese in four different places.
I asked about other things, I met the same yoghurt several times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the cheese counter I gave up and asked.
We did have it, it's true, in that narrow sector were all the selected, less usual and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If eviction, I won't go to any market and I won't buy anything, action or no action, a golden shop on the square, there they don't have such a selection, but they usually have everything I need, and they have it at a fixed price, so I'm done in ten minutes.

Sorry for the inconvenience and have a nice day.
In my childhood they punished me with the cane.
It was never because of marks, usually it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and got angry (read instead of going to sleep, washed the dishes, etc.).
At the same time, I have never been punished without being warned, my mother would always first threaten that if I did it again, she would give me a bruise (sometimes, even after another "slap", she would only bring and put it down so that I would see it).
Only after repeatedly refusing to listen did I receive a few kicks in the backside (through clothing).
I personally think that physical punishment (in a reasonable way and measure) is useful because the child reacts much more to it than to words.
It is important to me that this part comes with a warning, because it gives children the opportunity to choose whether they want to listen or not and whether they want the punishment or not.
In the end, I usually just needed a warning to start listening.
Defense of the system
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, Vojtěch Cepl, responded in 1999 to a journalist's question about what the Czech constitution meant to him - whether a sacred document to which one swears and which is taught about in school, or rather an agreement that can be changed if necessary - he definitely opted for the first understanding.
Once we agreed on the democratic rules of our life in the institute, which at the same time define who is the state and its citizens, and with changes it is better to save.
Imagine: some nations even have their own rules.
Just like the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cranberries, Vojtěch Cepl asked the question at that time.
In recent times, however, there has been a growing opinion among lawyers that the Czech Constitution needs amending.
It was tested by situations that its creators (to whom Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not predict, for example the behavior of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
All that we know about such documents shows that political interference in their text must be thought through.
The institute needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to overcoming most crises that companies encounter across history.
The constitution is not only a set of rules governing the exercise of power, but also a kind of code of conduct for politicians.
We are afraid that it will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we combine bans.
At the same time, however, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to use their power.
Covid-19 does not discriminate, in Brno FN fights for life of several-month-old premature baby
Despite the fact that it is known that the coronavirus is milder in children, there are also serious cases, with which hospitals are struggling mainly in recent times.
We know that children are endangered and affected less than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent in comparison with adults, said pediatric anesthesiologist and resuscitation unit chief Petr Dominik to Novinky.cz.
The course of the disease is usually much simpler, lighter, and often occurs without symptoms.
However, there are child patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we can see especially in the last period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, it is about dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It is taking place at a children's infectious diseases clinic.
Seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently in ARU.
Children with post-COVID syndromes have been on the ward continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
Now there is a rise in children with acute Covid-19 pneumonia, which means a lung inflammation requiring a stay in an intensive care bed," he said, adding that this illness is not just affecting adults but also adolescents and premature babies.
In hospitals, there are also children in a serious condition due to the coronavirus.
At the moment we have babies of several months and adolescents, said the chief physician.
However, there is joy that so far in the children's hospital FN Brno they have not recorded any child deaths from the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 years died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominika, a psychologist is an integral part of the work in a children's hospital – not only on the coronavirus ward.
At the same time, it points out that, just as in the case of adults, vaccination also mitigates the course of the disease in children and at the same time reduces the number of cases of the post-covid syndrome.
Proto-vaccination is also recommended for children, added the doctor.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk along marked paths.

China is building an image of having handled the outbreak well and that the authoritarian regime is weathering the crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building an image of having mastered the epidemic and that the authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was reflecting criticism for not being able to stop the outbreak, which turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in infected people.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus, for example in the worst-hit Italy.
How to interpret Beijing's willingness?
Is it a friendly gesture or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
You meet a friend and say to him: Don't you want to see the elephant?

Just a parade.
If you want to buy the elephant for 5000, I'll sell it to you.
Friend: we'll have fun, it'll be a parade...
After some time they meet again and the one who bought it complains: you fool, what did you sell it for a donkey?
The lawn is torn to shreds, there are huge potholes everywhere, the car is totaled, the kids are fighting, and the wife wants a divorce.
Ten co-producer says: You speak nicely about the elephant, but you won't give it away...
World events are controlled by the great powers.
Despite the equality of sovereign states, it is precisely the power that determines the course of international events.
Europe can only become a great power if it works on its integration.
So far, it is functioning on the level of economic and political (on selected issues), but there is still no military integration.
Personally, I think Europe is heading towards federalization.
For 10, 15 or 20 years.
Maybe in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will work.
It just hit me and it is quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so I'll probably use a dictionary.
I'm basing this on the fact that most ellipses include 2 different units on the same level.
I'll borrow an example from another comment, "Spanish oranges and mandarins," where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is not clear whether the mandarins are from Spain.
Moreover, I am basing myself on the fact that the sentence reads "all American forces" - i.e. including their weapons - and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad concept and is not necessary to further specify it for American forces.
Once again, just for fun:D
Either way, it's an absurd demand

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured monkey Milly
Disturbing footage shows the moment the terrified monkey cowered in a toilet cubicle as its heartless owner laughed at it.
Holland's orangutan also ate cookies, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
Magistrates' court in Gwent has now banned her for life from keeping animals, the Sun reported.
Experts in the rehabilitation of apes, who care for Milly after her ordeal, say they have never seen a more traumatised ape.
Milly spent almost two years being rehabilitated with the staff at Monkey World in Dorset, and now happily plays with another rescued monkey called Moon.
A mother-of-four admitted causing unnecessary suffering to two protected animals.
She was sentenced to 12 months in prison by magistrates' court in Gwent, suspended for 12 months.
Hollandová was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work and banned from keeping animals for life. She must also pay 12,000 Czech crowns in court costs.
Steph Sawyer, head of the Small Monkeys team who rehabilitated the abused animal, said: 'Milly is fine but her rehabilitation will continue.'
Milly took a long time to get used to people again.
She crawled and hid from everyone she met, and from any loud noise or sudden movement that might make her cry.
Opička refused to eat for a long time.
Now, when she's settled and happy with her mate, the sight of new people can still trigger panic in her.
Mental scars from torture will stay with her forever, Sawyer says.
The abuse of Milly was exposed after police in Gwent discovered disturbing footage on the woman's phone following a raid on her home over drugs allegations.
You can hear Milly swear vulgarly in the background.
In another video, you can hear Holland offering the monkey cocaine and saying: "Do you want cocaine?"
Don't touch me with your fingers.
In May, together with her partner Russell Cox (43), she admitted to having cocaine with the intention of selling it.
Cocaine was found hidden in Kinder eggs worth £1,600 in her home.
Cox was then sentenced to 30 months and Holland to 20 months, suspended for two years.
What amazing concepts will you learn from this prehistoric era three times in a row when you bravely jump over the entire 20th century?
Will you take the same things to the first grade as in the sixth grade?
The whole idea of bifurcation is to kill, when nobody really cares whether you can do it or not.
Mainly write the test for 1 and then nobody cares.
Go for a walk and talk to people on the street randomly, to see if you can handle the character roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients.
Everyone goes through it, and absolutely most people don't even blink and say to you that it's absolutely fine.
What does this curve teach?
I'm a big fan of the general overview and the fact is that people don't want it and don't need it.
At this very moment it is unnecessary and you will never get it.
To some extent, this is taught for all those people who will need that particular thing.
For example, here's a tip: you don't need to know any of this stuff when you're standing next to the machine... ...because you just don't need to know it.
In addition, we are slowly getting into the era when it is not a punishment.
Which we probably also owe to our communist past and the contempt for intellectuals and elites. However, the price we pay for that is high.
Had journalists been able to count, the covid here probably never reached such proportions.
Wedding at first sight: The war between Kadri and Andrey continues!
That's the main reason why Switzerland can't leave right away," Andrea responded on Instagram in the Stories section to curious fans' questions about what Kadir had done to disappoint her so much that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
Between Kadri and Andreou, there has been tension from the start of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea moves there with him, at least until he returns to the Czech Republic permanently.
She resolutely refused.
As you can see, their relationship not only ended in love, but rather, it grew into mutual dislike.
There was a planned attack on you! Outraged, Kadri reacted to Andreino's accusations of lies, gambling and debts.
Kadri's newfound honesty is not appreciated by his ex-wife or his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally I don't even talk about such things and in our family we have never talked about anything like that.
I don't want to cause any pain.
But when I see someone trying to drag someone else's name through the mud in public, I can't deal with it!
I'm sorry I have to do this the hard way, but I wanted to publicly thank my brother Kadri for being the person he is and for everything he did for our family when we needed it the most, even though he was so young.
I get more upset when I have to read such false information, which is probably taken out of context.
I would like everyone to know Kadri as I do, our close friends and family, in response to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful for everything!
Of course people will believe what they're reading, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love and know him and know the truth and know what really happened, she added vaguely.
A drunk burglar climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
Do you believe, for what reason?
Chao started his crime spree in the parking lot of an apartment complex, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the information available, he finally extorted a little over 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he didn't do anything better than climb to the fifth floor and jump into the apartment through an open window.
Tam stole two bananas.
On the recording from one of the security cameras, you can see how he walks down the street away from the scene of the crime and eats a banana.
When the apartment's owner woke up in the morning, he discovered that the bananas were no longer there and called the police.
Ta then stopped Cchaa.
The man admitted to drinking alcohol on the day in question.
Because he needed money, he decided to steal while drunk.
The whole affair is currently under investigation.
Opilec climbed the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and effective only in case of pandemic readiness.
When that is repealed, the law will not be effective.
Law restricts the scope of business
Is it not enough as a reason?
The right to gather will be limited, but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters came to the polls in the Saturday elections to four municipalities
People elected new municipal councils in the villages of Komňa on Uherskohradišťsko, Lužice on Mostecko, Nová Ves on Liberecko and Rovná on Pelhřimovsko on Saturday.
The number of councillors in these municipalities fell below the number stipulated by law, or the elected council was dissolved.
Out of the total of 28 mandates, 99 candidates competed on Saturday.
The average age of the newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils took place in them, and above all, very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said the chairman of the Czech Statistical Office Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that because of the Covid-19 epidemic, the elections were demanding in terms of equipment and personal security.
In Komňa, on the outskirts of Uherský Brod, the Association of Independent Candidates won the Saturday elections, securing 27.76 percent of the votes and two mandates out of seven in the municipal council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means winning two mandates.
Two seats in the council were won by Občané pro Komňu, who received 18.52 percent of the votes.
Znovu se do zastupitelstva dostaly i dosavadní starostka obce Jan Křižková, která je členkou hnutí Soukromník.
Komňany - independent candidates - got one mandate in the municipal council.
The turnout was 75.48 percent of eligible voters.
In the village of Rovná on Pelhřimov, the Pro Rovnou association won.
It won 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were also elected to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
Repeat elections in Lusice on Mostecko again won Sdružení Lusice a Svinčice led by mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the votes and, like in 2018, has four mandates in the seven-seat council.
The second-placed candidate was Obec pro lid, which received 43.27 percent of the votes, and will have three representatives in the council.
The turnout was 76.7 percent.
Elections in Nové Vsi on Liberec won independents Naděje pro Novou Ves ahead of the ANO movement.
Of the association of independent candidates, 59.88 percent of voters voted and won four places in the seven-seat municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and increased its number of mandates compared to the regular elections in 2018.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of eligible voters.
The results of the elections will be discussed by the State Election Commission on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
Do you think it would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff better than I do.
Jen si hraje na hlupáka aby se měl s kým "hádat".
If not, it's sad.
I do not believe that Christians are degenerates, nor anything like that.
I like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which after all was the goal that they should look good).
It's one thing for me to believe in something.
On the other hand, I find it disturbing how much the Church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it made, the repression of science and so on.
I don't like to talk about all the wars that have happened, for example, the Thirty Years' War.
TL;DR: Believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
A man fell head first from twelve metres.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived by a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, for which the rescue services of the Moravian-Silesian Region were called.
Employees at the regional operational centre received an emergency call an hour after Saturday's midnight with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two crews from the ZZS – medical and rescue – were immediately sent to the scene.
When the medical team arrived at the scene, they found that the 17-year-old man had fallen from a height of around twelve metres and hit his head on the concrete!
We caught coal in Vítkovice.
Not quite, as it should have been, and the firefighters went to the scene.
When the rescue team arrived, the man was unconscious with multiple injuries and in immediate danger of his life.
The emergency doctor intubated his respiratory tract, ensured artificial ventilation of the lungs and after further measures as part of the pre-hospital emergency care, the sanitary vehicle transported him to the further care of the Ostrava Trauma Centre, informed the spokesman for the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more afraid of the inadequate reactions of the public and authorities than of the coronavirus
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, but the first line of defense against infection is doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?

Legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends his title
MMA experienced a glamorous gala evening full of interesting results.
Things are happening at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to defeat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who failed to find a challenger for seven years.
Charles Oliveira in the lightweight class did not hesitate, he showed great submission against Dustin Poirier and defended his belt.
Kai Kara-France also won, defeating Cody Garbrandt with a technical knockout in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
Surprise, no one expected.
He brought the women's bantamweight bout between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
American entered the mutual battle as a "mere mortal", since Nunes had not lost for seven years and was dreaming of another triumph.
The start of the duel also carried the spirit of paper expectations.
Nunes started her road to victory with a lot of activeness and even gave her opponent a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
Penova, however, would not be intimidated into making any more mistakes and even tried to attack her opponent's hand with a tape.
The second round was intense and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both fighters exchanged a lot of brilliant punches and hard hooks.
Peneva also got Nunes down on the ground, where she started to beat her.
You must defend and attack.
The American caused a huge shock when she won the title.
The main event of the evening was the lightweight title bout between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier.
At first, Poirier was doing better, but the card began to turn in his favor.
In the second half, he tried to be more active. Oliveira, who tried to tackle his opponent's hand, failed.
It didn't work out for him too much, but then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on the back and rained down a series of punches.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a moment, but then had to tap.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next bout, Sean O'Malley recorded a supreme victory. In the first round, he sent Raulian Paivu to the canvas with a hard right hand to the jaw.
He then took a beating from a series of precisely aimed blows and notched up his 15th victory.
Kara France managed to defeat Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now after seven years she lost.
Ten kyčel, or that kyčel?
At first glance, it doesn't look like anything complicated.
The majority of essential names in Czech only express one grammatical gender, and it is therefore not necessary to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or common.
Pak is also a fairly large group of significant names, for which the gender is not fixed.
Such significant names oscillate between two genders.
In the plural, double consonants are formed, and in some cases, remain unchanged.
For example, words such as "svízel" or "kyčel" are of the masculine and feminine gender, in the first of which the plural is formed according to the pattern of "machine", in the second according to the pattern of "song".
In other groups of substantial nouns, the different forms are already present in the first declension, for example: "row/row", "skirt/skirt" or "potato/potato" (in the sense of food).
The words are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore interchangeable.
Some words can vary regionally, for example, "okurka" in the Czech Republic and "okurek" in Moravia, in this case, however, the Moravian variant is not literary, other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "prikop" and "prikopa", "kobliha" and "koblih" and so on.
Some words that have entered the Czech language from other languages were originally inseparable, but gradually adopt Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is in the masculine and feminine gender, or the word "buffet", which has remained in the middle gender but has endings according to the model of "castle".
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation directly on the Greek borders?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border because of the growing number of migrants who are trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people have started to move to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped protecting them.
European politicians promise Greece support, humanitarian aid is also being prepared by the Czech government.

We haven't seen the blue sky in three months and we've been suffocating, writes the journalist from Sydney
Devastating fires, which Australia has been battling for almost four months, have killed almost 30 people and millions of animals and razed millions of hectares of land.
How do local authorities and residents cope with the disaster?
Does the government of Prime Minister Morrison need to do more to prevent the drastic consequences, as critics claim?
What will the world have to do to prepare for climate change in the future?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks to journalist Ika Detrich from Sydney.
False accusations are always rare.
Proto always writes everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with the fact that sexual violence is widespread in our society, and that it is covered up.
I don't know personally anyone who was falsely accused.
I know many people who have been raped and I have seen how their surroundings behave towards them or even the police.
The victims should always be believed.
It has become a trend that the victims finally open up about their traumas.
But most people don't really care.
And there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It is the face of all victims of sexual violence, but spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations are invented" and that it is a "trend" helps only sexual offenders.
Czech floods leave houses half-built, families without money to finish
Prices of construction materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people got into a tricky situation because of it.
She does not have the means to complete the construction of the family homes that are already underway, and the bank will not increase her mortgage.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is also increasing.
People do not have enough money to finish the family homes that are already under construction.
In many cases banks are refusing to increase mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best-case scenario, people move into half-built and unfinished homes.
In the worst-case scenario, the houses that have been built are uninhabitable, and families are forced to sell them, because they cannot afford to pay the mortgages and the rent as well," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We put up two to three family homes a year and in 50 per cent of cases this has happened.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to abide by some things contractually, even though materials have become more expensive.
So we work for free," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
Many people will only have financial problems.
If they counted on the fact that the construction of the house would cost five million, now it will be seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivon.
It corroded most of all from materials such as lead, iron and also plumbing and heating equipment.
Construction companies are also struggling with a lack of workforce.
In the Czech Republic, there is a lack of graduates in construction trades and the influx of foreign workers is slowing down the pandemic.
The situation regarding the issuing of building permits is currently more favourable.
In October, building authorities issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10 percent more than in the same period last year, Křeček explained.
We're doing well and will be even better.
Real visions are missing, says the commentator for ČRO - mujRozhlas
In addition to the traditional New Year's celebrations, politicians have for years also used the occasion to make political statements.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the leader of ANO, Andrej Babiš, Christmas messages were also delivered by the President, Miloš Zeman, and the chairmen of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
What did we learn from the basic?
As it happens, just as I get my master's degree super, I have my own topic which I have chosen, which is based on my bachelor's degree, I do that for a whole year and then I write the written part for a week or two.
State officials are completely at ease here if a person is not a total idiot and something is left in his head, the commission will not bother him with theory.
I had to learn the state anthem for a week and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to bring me to some logical deduction, which I immediately got and I had it right.
For those projects, known people, who pay someone to do their semester project (we did it a lot, really useful, it teaches you a lot) and then just learn the project and are prepared.
According to me, it is great when at the end of the subject is an examination, to which the knowledge gained within the project is applied, not just the defence.
Everything is OK, but do not send any e-mails or telephone the embassy.
You will be the same as them.
You don't have to have anything in common with the people at the embassy.
If they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so they may have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
You can calmly put up a statue of Putin next to the statue of the bear.
It would be good to give it to him so that he falls on Xi Jinping's back or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing artists under the bus.
If you post a story every day and at least one picture every second day, you will reach an absolute minimum.
Furthermore, it changes what is more important for the function, whether like, comment or storage.
I've been terrified of this for a while now, so maybe I'll have to tone it down a bit, because there are a lot of artists in my field having success and they don't seem to be able to cope with it.
In the end, I might even have been glad, if something more user-friendly had come along, which didn't exhaust all the creativity and energy of the artists
Declaration of the Party of Workers of Donbass
Svazu - yes, the break-up - no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR are expressing their opinion on the photo.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
The biggest geopolitical catastrophe in history occurred on December 10, 1991.
On 8th December 1991, in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any statutory powers and in violation of the results of the referendum on 17th March 1991, with an openly conciliatory attitude from Mikhail S. Gorbachev, signed an agreement that "the USSR, as an international legal subject and as a geopolitical reality, ceases to exist."
One stroke of the pen "cancelled" a huge country with almost three million inhabitants.
The break-up of the USSR left millions of ethnic Russian citizens living abroad.
Since the beginning of the nineties, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
In spite of the loss of the Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both world wars put together!
Even earlier, the same people who, in one sitting, destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out de-industrialisation, sabotaged agriculture, and detached fourteen republics from the greatest world power that had previously been economically linked in a single mechanism.
If we want to look deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the breakdown of the economy, science, the army, the growth of criminality, interethnic conflict, war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, NATO's expansion to the east, the war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the first being the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in political science as "vacuum of power".
Everything that was hurriedly ruined and surrendered was quickly filled and occupied by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
The whole world is still shaken, above all, by events at the end of the eighties and the beginning of the nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a high turnover does not necessarily correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 Kč / kg.
I'm buying it with the idea of putting it in the freezer and making it into a meal on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, where I don't buy meat on Mondays, on Tuesday the chain reduces the price of meat to 99 Kč / kg - explain to me the mechanism by which meat, which changes its price, becomes a threat to my digestive system?
A or I'll wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted by 1 Kč / kg - how would this meat differ from the meat I bought on Monday for 120 Kč and left it in my freezer for 3 days?
I answer myself - nothing.
That's just how it is, that when something is cheap, it must be bad, tainted or of low quality, you're terribly retarded, I'll tell you the truth ;-)
Recently I went to Brno to Hlavas and in the underpass ladies were handing out some kind of leaflet, similar to things I always take, to help the brigadiers, who can't get rid of it...
No, the leaflet was full of peasant common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about God, I was perplexed, but I sensed it would be some kind of provocation.
After reading it, I found out who published it and it turned out to be scientology.
No, as it was a good matroš, full of completely useless lessons, as I need to learn and not be a pig.
Forests would not have to be cut down because of paper.
Something similar I experienced with a former girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will get you to do things for that person because you like them even though you aren't aware how much of a situation this is.
She threatened me a few times because I went out with a guy she didn't like.
Even when I wanted to leave her apartment she said goodbye and asked me not to eat anything.
Then she started physically blocking the doors.
It was a great relationship for about a year but then another half a year passed and it started to fall apart.
Then I ended that relationship with her and told her that we were breaking up and that I would talk to her next week to calm her down and not to worry.
Such a person sucks your energy, emotions and overall happiness.
Prefer to keep distance
When insurance companies rush to buy mirage tests and hunt for positive people who would not know about the terrible disease without the test.
The only thing we achieved is complications for companies, carriers and other, due to the fact that their employees were sentenced to five days of domestic imprisonment.
In the West, they gave up on the smallpox and recognized that it was not worth solving a disease weaker than the famous chicken pox.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and has to learn something and motivate himself with ego.
I think the old good thief is back with us.
After several years of decline and repression of this dirty business, MLM recruiting is again in the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20, a freshman at university), initial promises of training products and commercial skills were quickly replaced by "this doesn't interest you, just get people to buy".
Honestly, I was interested in the products I was offering because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and manipulate them.
When the first earned dollars came in, people quickly realized that if you want to make money, you have to hustle a bunch of certain products every month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable things, so people felt like peddlers.
But I can say that the experience was valuable, people learned that you shouldn't jump on every scam and to check information thoroughly.
At the same time, I would not put all of them in one jar.
There are successful people in this business and even people who are beneficial, but they will not boast of their expensive consumer goods or "fat" bank accounts.
In the corporation where I work there are not many things like that.
HR is calm, managers are looking for their managerial abilities, and they don't give a damn about us.
Regular evaluation is thus taking place somehow, in the form of how it happens here (set some goals for the next year, take a look at what came out and what didn't) - it's rather self-evaluation, not that someone is evaluating you according to some numbers, and so on.
Firefighting operations are also voluntary.
We are quite unique in our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes a person has the feeling that we are such a start-up that squats in the offices of a large corporation.
As long as the results are good, it works.
Czech woman missing in Britain is found dead.
Her body was found in London.
British police searched almost ten days for the missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday 12th December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in resignation, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that they had found a woman dead in Uherskohradište.
British police this afternoon confirmed to our embassy in London that they had found the body of the Czech citizen missing.
The cause of death is being investigated.
In the case of the family we will not report any more information.
Sincere condolences, Kulhánek wrote on Twitter.
The last time anyone saw the young woman was on November 28th, as she was getting off the bus on her way home from work. She had withdrawn money from an ATM before getting on the bus.
She was reported missing by colleagues five days later.
Following this, the London police began to search for her, and Interpol added her to its list of missing persons around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police in this connection arrested a man a few days ago.
What role he played in the case and what he is suspected of, but did not announce.
In four municipalities, new representatives were elected at the end of the year
On Saturday 11 December, new municipal assemblies were elected in the towns of Komňa on Uherskohradišťsko, Lužice on Mostecko, Nová Ves on Liberecko and Rovná on Pelhřimovsko.
The number of councillors in these municipalities fell below the number stipulated by law, or the elected council was dissolved.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates competed for 28 mandates.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters cast their ballots.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the municipal assemblies in the four mentioned municipalities.
Of the 28 seats, 36 women and 63 men competed.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 and the oldest was 72.
The processing of the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year.
They actually took place in them four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
At the same time, we mostly worked under difficult epidemic conditions, which put greater demands on equipment and personal protection, said Eva Krumpová, 1st Deputy President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49.
The results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission on Monday and will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
That is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
We had to deal with the fact that we had a very dangerous contagious disease here at the beginning, but it went well without major problems.
I have a problem with the fact that a large part of the population is behaving idiotically about this.
I'm looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) the most because thanks to it, I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not talking.
He was stripped of his presidency and eligibility to hold it again.
There is a chance that this will really happen, but as the others mention, it is rather small.
In addition, I am not sure whether it would be possible to regard the cartography of the register as treason at all.
Velezrada is an act by which the president of the republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.

How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who abstain from sex for the whole year is growing
The more young adults in the US live their lives without sex.
They are mainly religious people, the Daily Mail website says.
Surveys show that from 2008 to 2021, the share of people under 35 who abstain from sex has risen from eight to 21 percent.
Women aged 18 to 35 who said they did not have sex in the past year was more than ever before.
The decrease in the number of sexually active individuals is also influenced by other factors, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) has shown.
One of them could be the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and the higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks or video games could also contribute to making sex less of a priority for young people.
Since 2010, the share of men and women aged 18 to 35 who say they did not have sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly, said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
In married couples, sexual activity is more frequent, and only 5% of them stated that they had not had sex in the last year in 2021.
Among the free people it was 29%. Stone added that marriage before 35 is only a small percentage.
Loss of sexual activity also contributes to fear of premarital sex and religious foundations.
Despite the fact that married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of women aged 35 and under who are married or in a relationship continues to fall.
Young people's opinions on premarital sex divide, about 30% think it is a bad thing, while around 70% think it is okay.
It's true that they're a minority among free individuals in that age group, but their behavior is driving this trend," Stone said of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious foundations.
Since 2008, the proportion of abstinence among people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
The "less religious" trend rose from 10 to 20 percent," Stone said.
Sexual activities also contribute to other factors, such as less social interaction and mainly social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is smaller for people without work, or with lower incomes.
Another reason could be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, which "replaces" this need.
This trend became widespread during the lockdown during the pandemic of coronavirus.
Compulsory vaccination against Covid is about whether society should be able to force a portion of the population to behave in a way they don't want to, but which could save their lives.
It's a fairly difficult question, the one I personally find most interesting is the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether it will be our fault if we don't order it and they die.
My argument is that we certainly could have killed an 80-year-old man who really didn't know much, we explained it well to him, he heard some disinformation and as a result he refused to be vaccinated and ended up dying.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can blame the death of an opponent of vaccination, who is here with the SPD and the KSČ, for something about oppression and a totalitarian state.
From those statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that most of the unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will actually be able to afford it.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
The winter so far in the Czech Republic has brought one of the lowest snowfalls in recent times.
Providers of ski resorts cannot do without technical snow, and even preparations for the Jizerska 50 ski race are complicated by the weather.
Is it a trend or an exception?
Little snow - what does it mean for the drought in the Czech Republic?
I had one story, but it's not about a bouncer.
Once, in the middle of the school year, our teacher led us through the whole city to the boat yard so we could row boats down the river.
That is where we went one day down such a very wide street, and who in the middle we do not see - supporters of the Hare Krishna sect.
Naturally, they took advantage of us.
I managed to escape, but I started talking to one of my friends.
When she left, we asked her and the teacher what they were saying.
They ask me if I want to save my soul.
I've already told them I have no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, were laughing all the way to the shipyard.
We are absolutely devastated.
It's not happening that much, but the system is crumbling, says Orozovic
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
We are opening a new chapter in relations between us, said Morawiecki at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show that it will not accept violations of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
The crisis, caused by worrying movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, should be solved using diplomatic negotiations, even within the "Normandy format" grouping France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine, according to the Chancellor.
Morawiecki stated that the Chancellor was informed about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukašenko artificially provoked the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapon, because every night we record a hundred attempts of (illegal) crossing the borders.
I spoke to the Chancellor about further sanctions to make sure that Lukašenk's regime and his patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz, according to the DPA agency, assured that Warsaw is counting on German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of the Lukashenko regime towards its citizens.
Polish nun caused accident, tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but it was driven by another nun who was trying to take the blame on herself.
When the policemen told her that nevertheless she could lose her driving licence for giving way and driving away from the site of the accident, she spoke the truth, the TVN24 station reported.
She admitted that another nun had run into the car and asked her for help.
The policemen came for Celestina's sister.
They subjected her to a breath test and then, after discovering she had over twice the legal limit in her blood, immediately took away her driving licence.
At the same time, they informed her that she will have to answer for her actions in court.
Pes Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies watched American stories about dog heroes.
But they forgot one crucial thing: the laws of filmmaking.
After the heart-warming film F. Brabce Gump - a dog who taught people how to live, we now have another film Tady hlídáme my (We're Watching).
The co-author of the script and the director, Juraj Šajmovič ml., freely refers to his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
Back on the scene is talking parrot Hugo and some familiar characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a mountain pension that is going bust, begin to receive visits from all sorts of people, including Julie's father and his partner, and above all, her daughter Veronika.
You're not a little girl anymore, but a young woman experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner, Beatriz Schamovich (who is also the film's producer) struggled with the pacing of the narrative in their previous dog film, but at least children and dogs were entertained.
This time, the creative duo wrote a weaker script, which evokes a mixture of awe and feelings of claustrophobia.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, a scientist, succumbs to the darkness of superstition in her yearning for a child, and when the right “constellation” appears, she has sex with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever coordinates happen to be – in a car, or the church tower (obviously during an excursion with a local guide), retired colonel Mojmír shoots his own daughter (Julie), who falls into a coma, at which point she is taken away by the family to the hospital, so that the miracle of healing can take place in the heart of the Sumava mountains.
Nic against the cleaning of nature and the strength of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
The viewer soon realises how much content packed with unbelievable situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a competition for pigeon fanciers, a charlatan from the Šumava mountains, policemen arriving in response to a tip-off to look out for "drugs" and discussing the power of bone marrow to fertilise the soil – and what family of course would not get drunk in a pension.
When the heroine, after a long bout of unconsciousness, wakes up groggy and sits at the dinner table with her family, smoking a cigarette and demanding her father's whiskey and a glass of water as a recovered vegetarian, you can't help but laugh.
The creators explain to the viewers that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Šajmovič's team is missing the basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build the main situations, a sense of character and point of view, and direction.
The acting is uneven, the editing is shoddy, and the overall impression is of a film at sea.
Although Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Jesková or Nela Boudová try to save their parties, they don't have much to play with.
The only thing left from the film are the poetical shots of the Sumava nature by the cameraman Vladimír Holomka and the two deer.
It fails to sketch out several characters, a flimsy plot and bitchy one-liners, let alone more down-to-earth vulgar expressions the characters use.
The argument is not even membership of the Breeders' Club - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between man and dog, it is necessary to know the craft, so that the man wants to believe the story.
It did not succeed in this case.
There's a little too much erotica and not enough wit for the genre.
Ani as an advertisement for cannibalism would have passed that amateurish piece.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to a constant stream of nonsense from the likes of you.
The difference between offering and forcing, here it is clear how you understand it, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always the customer's, if he doesn't want to answer, the answer will always be no.
If you were to listen to such a kid, you might change your mind.
It's work like any other, in this case a brigade on the side.
The Middle East is suffering unusually dry months.
Zima is the only time of year when it rains.
“Almost complete absence of rainfall during November, as we recorded at some stations, is unusual,” confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of long-term average rainfall in November.
This week's two-day thunderstorm was more of an exception.
It is good for us.
It's been a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, Nazareth resident Wasím Aškar said.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in winter months, is abrupt and irregular.
Winter rains make forests dependent.
Without them, the world would be boring and prone to fires.
It is not only about the forests, but also about the supplies of drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, is overflowing this spring thanks to three consecutive rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers have been warning of drought for a long time.
It is expected that with global warming and changes in climate, rainfall may decrease here," said Uri Schor, spokesman for Israel's Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel is adept at using technology, such as desalination or recycling waste water.
These are economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, there is a growing number of tanker trucks.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
Last year, I received orders for 70 to 80 percent compared to two previous years," reported Imád Sulejman, the driver of a tanker truck.
Clashes between farmers and security forces have been reported in the Iranian city of Isfahan.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The local river's banks were completely dry.
The region has seen its driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military strike against Iran
Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that the talks in Vienna had not brought about "any progress" and that he had informed Washington about the preparations for the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reports.
Gantz, who lives in the United States, is trying to persuade Americans to increase pressure on Iran, but also informed Washington about military preparations.
At a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that nuclear talks in Vienna had not brought about "any progress" and world powers "realize the Iranians are playing games with them."
This happened to me about 3 years ago.
I flirted a bit and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wanted from me.
In the end, I found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Since I really don't like those kind of people, I riled her up with some doubts and questions for a few minutes and then thanked her and left.
Tell me calmly that I was drunk, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
The skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, there was enough snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic saw their first major increase in interest in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no need for snow and some ski resorts have started operating.
Sjezdaři were not deterred by the obligation to present a COVID-19 certificate at the checkpoints.
While snow-tubing operators aren't complaining about lack of interest from customers, some ski rental shops report weaker demand for their services than before the outbreak.
Thousands of people went to the ski slopes and cross-country ski trails in Liberec region at the weekend.
Snowboarders and skiers enjoyed the weather, which offered sunshine and excellent snow conditions.
We are happy that the opening weekend really took off from Thursday evening skiing when we had the first skiers on the mountain, said the director of the Sporting Areas Ještěd, Jakub Hanuš, proudly.
People also went to Jeseníky for the first weekend of skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the center in Branná on Sumperk were opened.
Weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday as well.
Conditions are unfavorable.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so it was perfect, said Rostislav Procházka, a representative of the Branná ski resort.
Providers of ski resorts can sell skipasses only to people who are vaccinated or who have recovered from COVID-19.
With one exception, people are prepared for this and provide the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center told CTK.
We recorded only one incident, he added.
Lower demand than before the pandemic is reported by some loan companies and retailers of ski equipment.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like it used to be, but there are still plenty of customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
There will be a greater influx during the skiing holidays.
The manager of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, David Šinták, also feels that because of Covid, there is less interest in renting ski equipment.
We were almost ready for the pandemic before it happened.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, said ČTK Šinták.
People according to him got used to the pandemic and learned to stay at home.
On the contrary, there is a big demand for loans in the Novako on Božím Daru area.
Skis have been available for hire there for a few weeks now and interested parties can now book them in advance.
We are starting to lend out bikes this weekend, but people have been calling in advance, so we are expecting a lot of interest, as well as alone, said the operator of the complex, Pavlína Nováková.
According to her, interest is comparable to that before the epidemic, also for the ski school.
If we want successful and wealthy people not to leave the country, they must be able to live a quality life here as they would abroad.
It certainly does not belong to socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and cunning people, who have no property here, leave the country.
The owner of the company does not want to leave the country.
I completely agree.
If those people don't live well in the CR, and if those people don't see a reasonable future in the CR, then those people simply will not live in the CR.
The exodus from Hungary started when Orbán won, ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
I naively thought that the Czech Republic could not be in a similar position day after day.
The next question is the elections.
If you're going to live quietly here, some traditional V4 nutcase is going to win.
Young and educated people will leave, his supporters and people whose property cannot be confiscated will remain.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood due to bet on beer?
While in the Czech Republic the autumn was in full swing, in Thailand the film's crew, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), enjoyed the tropical weather!
At the same time, the perpetrator published a bloody photo of his face on social networks.
Is it a real injury or is it staged for the cameras?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech.
She was last seen on her way home.
The disappearance of Petra does not resemble her behavior at all and we are starting to get very worried about her," said Lucy O'Connor, a police officer from the Lambeth borough, where Srncova worked.
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work on Sunday November 28th at around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen in a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by someone from her colleagues on 3 December.
Srncová, according to British media, worked as an "assistant nurse" in the Evelina London Children's Hospital, part of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.
We are deeply concerned about our colleague Petra, who is missing, said the group of healthcare facilities in a twitter post.
We want to encourage anyone who may have information to come forward," the message continued.
The public is also being called upon to cooperate, including Member of Parliament Harriet Harman, who drew attention to the case of Srnčová at a press conference on Saturday.
She's been missing for a few days, she's 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably distraught,“ the Labour politician said, holding up a photograph of the woman distributed by London police.
I feel like we all have a special responsibility to try and find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family, and she was working here for our health service," Harman said.
The police have already detained one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police did not provide any information about his identity or the suspicions against him.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (around 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
They are not "enormous numbers," but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Remember that Ukraine constantly repeats that it is exaggerating the threat of an invasion and that our entry is full of teeth.
I was on top.
I don't know what he thinks Russia wants war for.
War is expensive and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparing the situation in 38 is beyond so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can now compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily:D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia annexed those strange republics.
That is how it is and that is what this "concentration" at the borders corresponds to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
In Prague, new timetables come into effect from Sunday, which will mainly affect suburban services
Passengers in Prague's integrated public transport (PID) are expecting several changes from Sunday, which primarily affect suburban services.
New links were created, some changed their route, and others disappeared.
The newly integrated system also involves Mladá Boleslav.
In the capital city, express trains from České Budějovice stop in the Zahradní Město station.
In the suburban rail service, S7 trains will run, which on the route from Beroun to Czech Brodu will pass through Prague's main railway station.
The R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will now stop at the recently opened Praha-Zahradní Město station.
PID is being extended to other areas.
In addition to this, buses will travel to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses on the Mladá Boleslav route will be included, including those with services stretching into Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
Integration will result in the closure of 77 lines, the introduction of 37 new ones and changes to the operation of 12 existing lines.
From Prague's Zličín, a new bus route 405 is leaving for Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovník has also been created, which replaces the cancelled train S53.
Trains will be reinforced during the morning rush hour and on weekends, when a new express train number 404 will be launched.
Lines 400 and 410, running to Liberec, are now included in the PID system.
They depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nádraží Holešovice station.
Core route 400 runs via Mělník, Dubá and Czech Lípa to Nové Boru, with selected services continuing to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The supplementary route 410 travels via Mělník and Dubá to Doksy, Mimoně and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the contrary, dozens of local lines in Central Bohemia have been closed or curtailed, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway there are long-term restrictions on the Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín lines.
Travellers can also expect changes at other places.
Buses replace some of the cancelled railway lines or extend the section of the 420 line from Dobříš with connections from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevsko.
Trajectories of lines 540 to 543 on Nymburk have changed, and the routes of some buses on the border between the Central Bohemian Region and the Plzeň Region have been altered.
Healthy lunch/dinner from the supermarket
Hello, I work 9-5 with a 30-minute break, and my only option to get lunch is to walk next door to Billy or a little further down to Lidl.
Since I don't have any movement, after work I don't have the strength to train, so I have to eat as healthily as possible.
Sadly, I never know what to buy and I buy pizza, cheese and yoghurt and fruit at the speed of light.
Question: What would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket without the need for thermal processing?
Not everyone is waiting for a metre of snow like you, unfortunately.
It's not about trees you have to see.
Only the top of the tree is visible through the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I know it's the only reason they give us for not being allowed to ride off piste, but it's one of them.
Dary's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I didn't want to do this at all
The Czech showbiz fish pond died on Friday other than revealing the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara now sent a lengthy message to fans, explaining why she had kept her love for them a secret for so long.
You have my permission to state that currently there is nobody in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would feel guilty about having caught a bear, i.e. a pardon, a bear," jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech football player up to his ears.
But he picked her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the focus, and though they're used to the public's interest, they're not happy about it.
This is where.
To, what we were both afraid of, but we knew it would happen one day, continues the singer.
I don't know who is worse off.
If you, who don't give a damn and jump on them even from a can, or we, whose lives they dissect.
As if someone would want to hear your opinion on whether or not you're compatible with your husband or partner, or if you're standing firm on the fact that everyone needs to know the full list of your ex-partners and be aware of your mistakes and flaws.
That's enough, that's what you want, Dara.
The duo met up in Italy, where Rolins has been preparing her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been working for Juventus as vice-president for a long time.
The truth came out now, because they were waiting for the conclusion of Nedvěd's divorce.
He and his wife, Ivana, have been separated for three years, but have only been divorced for three weeks.
In any case, to those who are happy with us and wish us well, we thank you.
We are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
I love my new man and as he is with me, so I am with him. Good and bad, Rolins concluded.
Hello, other commenters have probably already said everything essential, but I just want to confirm that the dorms are great to start with, my classmates and I mostly met and became friends during the first semester or two, and then found flatmates together, which I think is the best option, because you know, who you're going to be living with.
Most flats aren't advertised for long in advance, so you probably won't find what you're looking for now, but it won't do any harm to have a look at what's on offer.
For sure, not only Cejl, but also its surroundings (Vranovská, Francouzská streets, that is a pretty bad address), and some parts of Žižkov are rather ghetto.
Contrary to that, the Veveří quarter is quite student-like, Královo pole and so on is great, besides that it is close to most faculties of the VUT (I don't know, to which faculty you commute).
I have never rented a flat, but I am a born Brňák, so I might be able to advise Brno as such, if you are still missing some information :)
It is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what some doctors decided to do in Poland, it is actually quite all right that the state does not sufficiently finance some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it themselves or they go by the state and pay for it.
We cannot allow a private actor to take over a piece of education just because it happens that with a few crowns it will be possible to pay the full state contribution and thus be able to teach what it wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when written by a person who two days earlier expressed himself in such terms about a petition calling for a boycott of the totalitarian state:
So the voice against it is the same as the voice for a statue to stand in the square?
I would have consulted with that person directly, the one who was giving you the work.
I have already experienced this during the cataloguing/digitisation, that (even long-time professionals) either think it's okay or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and add a note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I would not recommend it at all.
I would have dealt with it personally in a note, according to which program you use.
If you want to be a regular and diligent student, you can look up some sign language databases and find the closest one.
Because it looks like you're drawing from some book, I would tip that the author or printer simply created their own mark, which sits alongside the physical thing.
PS: Is it not rather Odrish Empire (kingdom) rather than Odrian?
PSS: Someone already told you.
Like this comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians do not know what the "topic" of our presidency will be.
It's much worse than the fact that there will be interpreters.
The idea that something was approved because no one understood some text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, and some basic knowledge of English is not enough for this, it is a matter of lawyers.
In various EU institutions, hundreds of translators and interpreters work, English is more suitable for informal contacts, forging overstandard relationships.
And with you being an English speaker, it's quite interesting after Brexit.
I'll see you at the Cejl.
I have been working there for the third year in a row and I am completely at ease.
I drive home from work at 10pm every night and have never had a problem.
Only someone who has almost never been there in their life can say that it is a ghetto.
Jo, most of the Romani population of Brno live there, but the only thing they do is to block the pavement and park where they shouldn't:D Definitely not the case of me being scared to walk out onto the street at night.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap accommodation with good access to the centre, I'd go for it.
There are plenty of newly reconstructed or newly built houses there now.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda and his girlfriend Gelemová!
Who is Vánoce with?
On Sunday, most people on the advent wreath lit the first candle, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an advent wreath so there was nothing to light.
I saw my grandmother's necklace and Lucie certainly has one too, said the saxophonist Blesk, confirming Patrasová's words that she often visits.
He visits, but does not live in their house on Vinohradek, where Dáda has been left alone since his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together!
We always have something to talk about, so there was no Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
Dárky buys regularly and Dáda and Lucia certainly buy something, perhaps perfume.
I am a gentleman, Felix added, who came to the club Richman for the music video premiere.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone with whom I want to have fun, says Slováček, who was glad to meet Luďka Sobotová's wife Adrian or singer Kamila Nývltová.
It was clear as day.
Do you think we are an island, so that we can allow ourselves not to have soldiers and weapons?
I think someone will defend us and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot to take it.
I don't know, why should it be a bad argument?
I don't know any other component that could be used in hospitals during the crisis.
There are few policemen and they cannot afford it, so the firefighters and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
A to, that our army is capable of defending so much Ostrava from previous governments, not the army, which has asked for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the country is not just a factory for food, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through its worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water levels have decreased in mountainous and sub-mountainous areas, and even places that did not suffer from a lack of water in the past are now doing so.
The cause of the drought, which is affecting much of central Europe, is climate change.
The consequences, however, are strengthened by the way we treat the soil.
What should we do to prepare for a drought?
How can we help nature in difficult times?
That's how it's going to be, just barely keeping my skates on the ice, I know what to do when it comes to playing hockey, but that tactics (what I've tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also overall crap.
If you're a hockey team called "Russia's bears" or "China's sheep" then losing by two goals is different to losing by any other score.
Well, that's how it is, as I listen to Czech commentators who draw my attention to things the referee doesn't see, whether it's male or female hockey, it's all very strange, but that's how it is with all sports, UEFA and the "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
In my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be like always, and that Czech Republic has lost more to Russia than it has won, it would be a classic "they lost" vs "we won".
Coronavirus: Number of cases in Russia exceeds 1 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily cases.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, and another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of cases in Russia on Sunday exceeded 1 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new cases have been registered.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered cases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "unavoidable" big wave of infections caused by Omikron, said Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the UK's Health Protection Agency, on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with coronavirus are already being hospitalized in the UK, and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
So far no one has died from Omikron, but people are hospitalized about 14 days after infection and die about three weeks after infection.
The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said on Sunday that Boris Johnson had clearly broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street in December, when the country was in lockdown and Christmas parties were banned.
Every minister in Johnson's government has defended the quiz, saying it took place "virtually," via computer.
However Downing Street groups of staff had gathered around computers.
Pressure is mounting in the UK for Johnson to step down as prime minister.
During the lockdown imposed in London last December, when all Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers organized numerous meetings despite the lockdown.
British public and media are outraged that Johnson and his government made a mockery of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial TV channel ITV for Britain: Two years ago today Boris Johnson won a crushing victory in the general election.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about removing him from the post of Prime Minister.
It is remarkable how quickly the events developed.
Do you want to protect your skin?
Hungary is waiting for elections in the spring, which may bring an end to the twelve-year rule of Viktor Orbán.
It will be an election of European significance.
How long can we wait for fairness?
Nebudou férové.
Probably not even free, because there were no such last two elections under Orbán.
His party, Fidesz, controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to its advantage, and pulls off other, smaller or larger tricks.
Ten is the last one, meaning that in practice everyone can choose where they want to go.
To enable Fidesz to bring voters from the decided districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could win.
So I'm just going to say that they won't be there at all.
Do you think it will be the same as in 2014 and 2018?
Because the situation is significantly different.
It used to be about whether Fidesz would win, but whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by the united opposition.
It is a great exception for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Was it difficult to maintain the power to play hard?
Yes, there are some signs that they are prepared to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, an audio recording of the president of parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, leaked to the independent media, in which the heads of secret services explain that the opposition is a threat to national security.
What are the signs of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, it's one of those new things.
It all starts with language.
I've been biting my tongue a lot recently, last time was in the 14th, my mother doesn't have much patience, nor do I, granddad has been waiting for a long time, but then he gets really angry (just about me).
At the same time, I'm a bit of a hypochondriac, and as a child I was terrified, to the point that I was lying on the floor crying and turning blue, and they took me twice to the bathroom to calm me down.
Occasionally, they taught me something, sometimes it was more that they didn't know.
Definitely, I also have a tendency to solve things violently, as a child I was quite a handful, now I at least try to fight my way out of something, and as the youngest I had to learn to behave, so I bit my parents’ hands (so as not to get smacked), so that I never did anything extreme, but I always had that urge.
I'm not capable of determining to what extent this is my explosiveness, but it certainly has its part to play in education.
I'm afraid I'll lose my patience with the child and deal with it the same way.
I think that having children is simply a bad idea and that my parents did not have to do it, especially not at that moment when it was no longer "educational" but out of frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent does something simply to vent, so perhaps it is not possible to blame them.

Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
Therefore, I would call you what the laws create in such quality.

Kočner's delusional world.
Did Slovakia move the process with the murderer of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial in the case of the killing of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It boosted civil society, but at the same time it uncovered the practices of businessman Marian Kočner, who was accused, and his links with the top of Slovak politics and justice.

For that, journalists can be thankful.

Next government ends and law on involving municipalities in selection of storage site nowhere to be found
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is coming to an end, and the law that was to ensure the protection of the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and licensing of deep geological repositories for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The government's legislative council suspended discussions of the bill, which the Ministry of Industry and Trade submitted to the government after protracted negotiations.
However, its content is in conflict not only with the affected municipalities united in the Platform against deep geological storage, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Municipalities expect a more significant strengthening of their abilities to decide where waste is to be deposited, which they have been promised by the Act on Waste since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by Czech nuclear legislation and European directives.
We expect that the new government, in line with its coalition agreement, will revise the draft in cooperation with the municipalities.
The minister Karel Havlíček's proposal, which is available to the Platform, is criticized by the municipalities, above all, for: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the selection of a location for a storage site is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
In reality, it can only be truly effective if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in that location at all.
It is possible to ensure compliance with the obligation to store data by obtaining the consent of the affected municipalities before the start of a specific proceeding.
The proposed draft almost completely disregards the involvement of the public and makes citizens of the municipalities practically mere statistics in the permitting proceedings.
In the proposal, there is no systematic setting of compensation for municipalities for the whole process of searching for and selecting a location for a landfill, its approval and operation.
Representatives of municipalities in reality according to current legal regulations do not have too many opportunities to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a place for a landfill.
Only in some licensing proceedings may submit their memories or appeal, but the office or the minister decides in whose interest the licence is issued.
A potential lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on conducting exploratory or construction works.
Spolurozhodování samospráv, o kterém Platforma požaduje, je princip, který je běžně používán v mnoha demokraticky vyvinutých zemích a definitivně pak v těch, kde již povolili úložiště, jako je Švédsko nebo Finsko.
The preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which outsources the preparation of legislation to external legal offices.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS, s.r.o., which SÚRAO concluded and which follows on from contracts with lawyer Jan Zemanek.
According to the register of contracts, the total sum for these works amounts to almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek location and speaker for the Platform against deep geological storage of radioactive waste, said: After the ministers of industry, who simply passed on to their successors the position of self-administration in relation to state authorities in the search for a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste, we are expecting a clearer turnaround from the new government.
We are also offering a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Association of Cities and Municipalities, which views the problem of insufficient rights for municipalities with regard to such a fundamental structure in the same way as directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The platform against deep geological storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) with the aim of promoting a change in the state's approach to dealing with burnt nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep geological storage.
The platform also advocates that decisions on selecting a location for possible storage be conditional upon the prior consent of affected municipalities.
Herce John Goodman (69) overcame his fear: He lifted 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for a long time, doctors finally scared him.
They told him he would die if he didn't lose weight.
A took it.
Goodman gradually shed 90 kilograms, half his original weight of 180 kg, The Sun reports.
He boasted about his new role at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles.
The guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John joked that his friends and family kept asking him to lose weight because his big frame was breaking their furniture.
I bit my tongue, he said in 2018 in an AARP interview.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Traveling, practicing.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still, he told ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It depends on which boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it's someone's text on a platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it is a text, for example, formal or university level, I would try to find a way to describe or explain it better.
There are various types of bosses.
Take a game like Dark Souls, for example. It has several bosses, so a "boss" is something like a lord / ruler of that level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), which are not necessary to beat at all in order to complete the game or level, but are often much stronger than the standard boss.
Are there any games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player doesn't fight them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua)?
No, they are mini bosses.
It is impossible to translate the word boss literally into any other language, including Czech or any other language.
If it's just a story or game in general, it's generally significant, computer-controlled, stronger than all previous enemies, and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The world is searching for missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
British police have been looking for missing Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police also took part in the search.
A 32-year-old woman from Uherský Brod is missing since December 7.
Skrz Interpol also helps British police.
Czech Petra Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice for her.
So the whole world is looking for Petra.
The Czech police closely cooperates with the British police, confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
We share information about the case, she added.
The announced search for Petr has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimetres tall, is chubby and has brown eyes and long, straight hair the same colour.
She comes from Uherskohradišťsko.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Local MP Harriet Harman also got involved in the search for Petra.
They started to put up posters with Petra's face on them.
We have huge fears, she said at the press conference on Saturday.
In connection with this, British police have stopped one suspect.
However, it is not clear to whom the letter is addressed and what they have in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a mild drop in offensive campaigns, attacks intensified significantly in the past month, as the end of the year approaches.
We recorded a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are deliberately targeted at the Czech Republic.
Attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is designed to catch the user's attention with the name, which refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month's threat had the word "invoice" in its name, this time it was called "Copy of the invoice for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes functions that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively seeks out stored login details, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the end of August and the beginning of September, with holidays and the end of the year approaching, the activity of attackers is growing again.
In November, Formbook spyware remained active.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic and security specialists caught more global campaigns in November.
In comparison with the data from the Formbook in November, V was slightly weakened, but still stands for almost a fifth of all detections.
Attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10, and 15.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the invoice continues to appear.
The supplement in Czech could be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decline and weakening of activity are noted by security analysts in the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and in the Czech Republic has not seen any major offensive campaign for several months.
Today's demo from the techies who don't need oxygen because they're vaccinated.
The Prague procession was bigger than the media reported.
According to the pictures from the parade and my experience, I would estimate the number of demonstrators at around 10,000.
People in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment communication.
It means that there are a lot of people.
About four thousand demonstrators are taking part in the procession, which is spontaneously joined by an unprecedented number of passers-by.
I believe that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
The fact that long-standing dissatisfaction among several large groups or layers of the population led to this.
Individual antivaxxers, antirouters and others would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The action of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is gaining ground, it reminds me of the Million Chances for Democracy campaign.
Sometimes I have the feeling that they rent the same podium and technology.
It's hard to say what movement you could appease with this dissatisfaction, not only depends on the flow of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will not become a four- and more-dose vaccine.
Definitely not a left-wing or centrist movement, that's for sure.
The trivalent vaccine will almost certainly become a pentavalent vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to wait every six months for the next dose.
I am very glad that the vaccine saved us.
Brilliant action by scientists, which the human race has a right to be proud of.
The end of the road, Bulgaria has a new prime minister announcing change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev entrusted the formation of a new government to Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement Continue the Change, which won the November elections.
Tomu succeeded in putting together a broad coalition that should take office within a few days.
Political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
Victorious parties advocating the fight against corruption and abuse of power could not reach an agreement, so there were two early elections.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The "secret" footage is a global hit.
In the UK over the weekend, fears grew for the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been missing for several days and whom the London police have been looking for.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
According to information about the nurse from the children's hospital, besides the police, her former employer or a member of parliament representing the part of London where she lived is also calling.
The disappearance of Petra does not resemble her behavior at all and we are starting to get very worried about her," said Lucy O'Connor, a police officer from the Lambeth borough, where Srncova worked.
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work on Sunday November 28th at around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen in a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by someone from her colleagues on 3 December.
Srncová, according to British media, worked as an "assistant nurse" in the Evelina London Children's Hospital, part of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.
We are deeply concerned about our colleague Petra, who is missing, said the group of healthcare facilities in a twitter post.
We want to encourage anyone who may have information to come forward," the message continued.

In Ústí nad Labem there is a month-long hole in the road in the form of a canal without a roof.
It was his life.
The magistrate referred the complaints to the RSD, which owns the road, and since it did not react, the pothole continued to grow.
In the end, the authorities cleared up responsibilities and ownership and after a month the ŘSD "intensively started to resolve the situation".
