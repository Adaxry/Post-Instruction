Hello, I wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and so far have not received a reply.
It's about my wardrobe which arrived yesterday (order number #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is not currently in use.
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again.
A variable-frequency PWM with a range of 10kHz to 50kHz ensures super-quiet operation, even in bells-and-whistles motors – the typical “buzzing” is a thing of the past.
The load regulation can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Auto Tune" function allows automatic calibration of the decoder to the engine.
The LokSound 5 decoder supplies with up to 1.5A motor current, enough juice even for older motors.

New York remporte la MLS pour la première fois
New York City FC has won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular time against hosts Portland Timbers, the Eastern Conference team decided the final in a penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had defeated Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Free entry for members: Europa-Park organises a SC Freiburg fantasy day
The Europa Park, named after the Europa Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park communicated, members and long-term ticket holders of the sports club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were entitled to visit the Europa-Park free of charge on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster cars glowed red and white on this day through the T-shirts.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," the park said.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the Freizeitpark in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 90s.
The first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park once again showed how well the partnership fits.
Seeing glowing fans having fun on the rollercoaster confirms that," says Europa Park owner Jürgen Mack.
I have a total of 5 books.
Four of them go.
Only the one thing I bought today doesn't work
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one
And don't cancel the whole order.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cupboard and make it available to the transport company.
I can't mount it under the tabletop.
It is a Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
Kind, 4 j., Splitter under the fingernail
Kind, four years, has splinters of wood under the fingernail (outside).
They tried to pull him out with a pair of pincers.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try to do it.
No chance.
I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.
It works.
Many thanks for the help
I wish you a nice evening
I have to print it and stick it to the package and send it with the post, right?
Do I have to do anything else here?
Hello, unfortunately I cannot access the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# to the email address above?
Retour de la commande #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Will I receive a confirmation by email?
I've had that from your colleagues 3 times already... how reliable is your information?
When will the shipping company contact me?
It still doesn't work. I can only long for the cover page but not turn the pages.
I am not at the assigned date, on which #PRS_ORG# picks me up.
As I am not able to be there in person due to a funeral, unfortunately, this cannot be changed.
Could you please assign me an alternative pickup date.
As of 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available again.
Why children are not tyrants, documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today and I watched it immediately.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and holds lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why our children are becoming tyrants" (2008), he triggered a heated debate on education.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please be warned, the film is tough to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
It should never, never, never be up to parents and others to have power over the child.
Our aim must always be to give the child scope for their development and to make the frame for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the circumstances.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Could you please call me back as my delivered wooden table is defective.
Body damage due to crashed delivery of the #PRS_ORG.

All company and brand names and all mentioned type designations are the property of the respective rightful manufacturers and rights holders.
Their mention serves only to provide guidance and to bring to light the compatibility of the goods in question.
They are not original products of the respective printer manufacturers, but compatible goods.
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG.
The mirror has a chip and the frame also has a fault, which has been attempted to be covered with a yellow filler.
That looks unpleasant.
I would like to give back the mirror and have already packed it up and attached it to the parcel.
How do I proceed now for the return?
Is there an installation guide?
How long would I have to wait to get these or decide to return them?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG and they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
I have not been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
I'm sorry to hear that your package was returned to us due to an error on your part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG and redirect it, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and the order is cancelled again?
Unfortunately, for me that would mean that I would not order again because it has already been waiting for a long time.
Whether as a comforter for tummy aches or just for cuddling – my little heat source is versatile.
Kirsch kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing warmth, as cherry pits absorb and then release heat very well.
The detachable inner cushion can be easily warmed in the microwave or oven.
The soft connection makes use particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel secure, even if it does not go so well for them.
The Kirschkern cushion with reference is suitable exclusively for the following applications:
Before warming up the cheese on an unusual smell, stock or burn spots check and dispose of immediately if present.
Please remove the cushion before use!
In the microwave at maximum 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (information from the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back in place.
With the first warming, a slight moisture can form on the surface, which disappears with repeated use.
Please adhere to the given heating instructions, as long periods or high energy performance can cause damage (fire and combustion danger!).
Check with the manufacturer that it is safe to reheat food in a microwave before doing so.
After the heated inner cushion was replaced, please check the temperature of the cushion on your armrest to ensure it is suitable for babies (max. 43°C)!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory disorders, fresh hematoma, bleeding and open wounds, and in persons with diminished pain perception.
For existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumour illnesses, as well as during pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If stitches have been opened and loose cores come out, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessibly for children.
If the product is applied to babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be regularly monitored to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents which occur in connection with the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authorities in the country in which the user is established.
The cover is detachable and can be washed at 30°C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Lahnsteiner defence for water rescue kitted out: €45,000 grant from the state
Recently the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant award of €45,000 for the new water rescue vehicle of the volunteer fire department in Lahnstein to Lord Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to €135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatine is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they are used increasingly: the boom in hotel ships on the Rhine and Moselle, and the continuing increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
Here, the lower part, that is, the part with the loading space, was damaged.
Is everything going to be taken away again or just the rubbish space?
What discounts???
I had forgotten to write my discount code in the last order!
I've done that many times and it doesn't work.
Theme of the week: The best low budget films
What a low-budget film exactly is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say on the matter:
>Un film de **moyen budget** ou un film de **moyen budget** est un film tourné avec peu d'argent par un studio de cinéma majeur ou un investisseur privé.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, for example on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what don't you like at all?
I am waiting for a pickup time.
What do they want to give back, please!
Roulade Tips & Tricks
I had received many great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
We had it at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Merci encore une fois :)
Now I've got the taste for it and want to cook a roulade for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will put a beef bond on.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, only a large pot.
And with the voucher?
Otherwise, I'm a customer?!
After all, I did receive a defective delivery and have now paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is....
No, it's for all books, that's why the inquiry at #PRS_ORG, because it's probably a general problem.
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
For setting the colour temperature and brightness of the light, a modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650 K.
Use the current settings in the flash storage.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simply and intuitively operated.
The light emits a very high light current with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The emission angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively short distance, is excellent.
Incidentally, in situations with reporters in small rooms or close proximity.
They can adjust the brightness almost without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller enables the remote control of the light in television studios or if the light is installed in difficult to access locations.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
In addition, there is a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery).
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings, simply press one of the storage buttons for a longer time and finished.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practically in studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 is its ability to work with rechargeable batteries.
These are often in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can make use of existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check the batteries to see if they have enough performance before setting up - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments, a value is shown in the two display screens (the left battery upper display, the right in the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlights with power via the supplied network cable.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
It has a 16mm thread for fixing, so you can attach it directly to your tripod.
The tendency can be reliably set using fixers on both sides.
It was important that the mechanical components are extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a swivel joint is included in the delivery scope.
The fact that a bag is also included in the delivery is great.
This means that you can safely transport or store the light with all the accessories that you might want to buy.
Suction pumps are ideal for adding oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via an air pump.
This series is available in 3 versions from us.
Have a look at the bottom of the page.
You can compare the performance there.
If the pumps are strong enough, an entire plant can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are recommended so that you can connect more than one drain.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. But fans are also available to set the accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here, a treasure chest, mussel or similar could be mentioned.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and as a result, operates quietly.
The installation is very easy.
The blower pump is connected to an exhaust pipe 4/6 mm via an air hose... and it can already start.
The fan should be level with, or higher than, the water level and installed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a bypass valve should be installed.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent water from flowing backwards, which is what happens when the water in the tank is pumped out by the pump...
If the fan is to be installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we are showing the processing time here on ebay as 3 days, the parcels are packed every day and collected every day.
Everything is running smoothly, it's going very quickly.
We just don't want anyone to be upset, just because it took a little longer this time.
It's like this, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics sector...obviously here, no-one is stopping for Corona.
Please do not rate us poorly just because the delivery took longer than expected, that is entirely the fault of the postal service.
Of course you bitch about these services, even if we say at the moment,...they are damned difficult
This is also very different regionally.
Be kind to everyone, stay healthy, and we all hope there will be better times again.
Could you please send me the three variants per email and tell me how I can reach them again best
Pillenproblem
Hallo liebes Weibsvolk,
I hope I'm doing everything right, it's actually my first post after a year on reddit.
My problem: I was forced to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I was having such horrendous period pains and PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it again, because I already take enough medication due to chronic illnesses, which I cannot choose for myself.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had got 0-100 acne all over my face in my last, about two-year, break.
So superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel good.
In the two years off, it never really got back to normal.
Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid it this time.
Parfume-free and without fuss is my cosmetics already, but perhaps someone can recommend something to me.
Gynaecologist hasn't taken me seriously and dermatologist appointment is still pending.
Thank you to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, the love skin is so a thing.
Had severe neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then widespread patches of eczema and the acne topic.
I have also tried every possible diet during my Christian illness and have remained on a sugar, milk and meat-free mixed diet because nothing else worked so well.
It can also be the case that hormonally the worm is just in there, but if, like me, you have a building site everywhere, you don't want to go looking for anything else that's wrong.
I sent you an email which you did not reply to.
The question again.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
He told me they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG.
Is that so?
If so, I'll have to cancel the order, as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Am I not being called?
I had a question formulated.
If I have downloaded a book onto the #PRS_ORG#, the message comes up Your #PRS_ORG# has not authorised this book
Do you have any problems?
Gutschein klingt super
Then I would solve it independently for the new order.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
Ordinary through child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organised at work (I am self-employed, with very little free time), but for as long as I can remember I have struggled to keep on top of my finances.
There are always phases where nothing happens and then suddenly it hits me and I pack up and clean.
But it is actually never "that someone spontaneously could come for a visit."
My husband (unfortunately) is not better, it bothers me somewhere but mostly the household just loses out against work and laziness.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become a decent parent?
We haven't got one yet but we are working on it and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
Because for me there is no incentive, it just doesn't bother me, so long as there are no visitors and, for example, there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Do you give your child a bigger incentive or remain careless?
I am looking forward to your answers.
I would like to give away a voucher code.
So with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Do they do that?
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Up to now, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still-unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in recent days, but volcanologists dared not predict when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the lava, which is hotter than 1,000 degrees, has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Nearly 1,200 hectares were covered by a metre-thick layer of lava.
That is equivalent to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new land masses, totalling around 50 hectares, have emerged from the coastline thanks to the solidification of lava.
Above all, the banana cultivation for the island, which provides employment for around half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants, direct or indirect, was hit hard, and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were heavily affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
I have ordered a lamp shade to be delivered to you.
Now I see that the article is too large/bulky for my taste.
For this reason, I have already ordered another hanging system from you.
If the lamp is sent in March, how long does the shipment take?
We don't need to have discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have therefore their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as tasty.
Shipping costs and time saved - and the environment benefits!
If you need more than one article, please click on "Pay now" only when you have all the articles in your shopping cart.
So the combined shipping is calculated automatically and you get everything in one package.

Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 went off more quietly than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn peeled off his gloves and wiped sweat from his brow.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight touch of the wall, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after just half the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in motorsport's premier class.
To say goodbye, his wife Minttu and their two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in the Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix, started 18 times from pole and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
If that doesn't work, I'd be happy with a voucher or discount.
Perhaps I will find a buyer for the furniture.
Only for goods that I don't need are more than 1,000 euros a lot.
The large main section is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro closures, it adapts to the needs of your photo equipment and is suitable for all kinds of cameras – from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format reflex cameras.
What finally fits into the rucksack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible kit would be a DSLR camera with a set lens, two to three changeable lenses, and a pop-up flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or an Fuji X-T2 still allow for the use of additional lenses.
In addition, you can store any number of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series), you can use the rucksack for your equipment and for photo-unrelated things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the rucksack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Have you already sat on the #PRS_ORG chairs?
Yes, the F-parts are it
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with some of them.
The central beam is held up by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too slender and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't put the bed together.
The central beam is held up by two feet, which are unfortunately faulty.
The middle beam does not fit into the planned support.
I also receive new ones.
When will they be sent?
No, not flat.
These are, according to the installation instructions, the right from the form, they were only too narrow
But who cares?
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
With me, they are not flat
Could I have received this?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
I have already cut myself.
This is an absolute outrage
Rotring brake discs are designed for the requirements of dynamic drivers who appreciate reliability and safety when braking, even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are cast and then mechanically worked (bored and cut).
All made-to-order glasses are produced in short series according to individual technical properties, which are specific to certain glasses and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production programme is created, which focuses on the extraction of the disc after the properties of the original assembly.
This way of producing cast iron discs ensures high comfort and brake effectiveness.
Additional cut-outs created enhance the efficiency of cooling the glass, with the notches improving the cleaning of brake discs and brake clamps.
The aesthetic features of our tuned wheels underline the character of each car through their attractive and striking appearance.
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Just a quick glance, just a quick help, just bring the bottle etc.
So, they learn responsibility, help out in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still have enough children, I see no problem.
If your K1 is occupied for the short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best judge whether this is suitable for your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and sit with him for hours until he falls asleep.
It is legally questionable.
Maybe this is why the psychologist made the statement.
Because if something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to worry about K2.
Whether this is now a risk that you want to take, of course, is your decision :)
Yes, I already reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have checked the legal situation again and have contacted them again.
We actually reported this half a year ago.
But two deep grooves, filled with something yellow, are on the edge of the wood part.
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself
I have one more question: the daytime cover #PRS_ORG#, do you have it in extra-large, for example in 240/240?
Hallo liebes #PRS_ORG Team,
I have already registered with you under the customer contact with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Thank you for the message.
But only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
The protein taken in with the food is broken down in the bird's gastrointestinal tract into the individual amino acids, and the bird then uses these to build its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the new feather formation in the growing bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high demand for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON Bio should not be administered during breeding, as this can lead to disruptions in the breeding process.
Following this regular gift from NEKTON Bio, the daily vitamin supplement with NEKTON S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.

Following this regular gift from NEKTON Bio, the daily vitamin supplement with NEKTON S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.
1 g NEKTON Bio per 250 ml of water or 100 g of forage.
It is only necessary to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes in a day, and to change the water/food daily.
A dashed measuring spoon (inset) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON Bio.
If the feather damage is severe, a double or triple dose of NEKTON Bio can be administered until new feather growth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until feather formation is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON Bio should be stored dry, without direct sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Iran sees progress in nuclear talks
According to Iranian sources, progress is being made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear deal.
Iran's chief negotiator, Ali Bagheri, told the news agency Irna on Sunday that "neither side is far from agreeing on the issues that are on the agenda."
This is a "positive and important development", because at the start there had been no agreement even on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement resumed after a nearly week-long break.
At the negotiations, intermediaries from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France, and Russia are participating.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
I have already written, have you not received my SMS?
The email to cancel was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In addition, twice.
This was not confirmed.
Not everyone has the time for your cluttered chat and wrongly delivered cheap Chinese goods.
Your error, which you are fixing and not all from our budget.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
I can only open a book for a short time, once I look at something else I can't read the book and have to log out and log back in and re-load the book and search for where I left off reading.
AM Saturday I have already communicated with you.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I had forgotten the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be available again?
Or will it ever happen again?

Yes, that is really easier!
Then we'll do it!
Can you send me the return form by email?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronauts' daughter and host into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host and four other passengers have gone on a short trip into space.
They were launched on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of Blue Origin, founded by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the roughly ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Against a backdrop of deep blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly selected astronauts back after their return.
Welcome back," Bezos said, wearing a blue space suit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in the air for ten minutes and thirteen seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the astronaut Alan Shepard, who flew into space in 1961 as a Nasa astronaut (1923-1998), after which the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were guests of honour for the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not share how much they paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembers her father's mission after the short flight.
He said he had to work hard and do everything himself during his shifts.
She just flew with it, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed himself enthusiastically.
He would love to go back to space again, the host said.
New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometers high
The "New Shepard" rocket system is largely automated.
The capsule, which had been separated from the rocket during flight, reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed by parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned mission for Blue Origin: the first, in July, saw Amazon founder Bezos himself on board, together with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot and a 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second, in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was there, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and Blue Origin's vice president, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
DDR model of handicraft E-lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably originates from the conversion proposal of the model railway enthusiast ME No. 11/1968, used with traces of play and parts missing, see photos, Functions well, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the German Federal Railways (DRG), conceived for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, the building set could also originate from the small-scale manufacturer ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is on display in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working order
In 1924, the German Imperial Railway Company commissioned AEG to come up with proposals for an electric locomotive that should be able to handle 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this stretch of track.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
Therefore, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with tapered roller drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, and Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were brought to the Soviet Union as war reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
All six locomotives at the Dessau depot of Deutsche Bahn have been found to be fit for refurbishment.
[4] As electrification of the middle German network progressed, there was a growing need for locomotives for the heavy freight train service, and in 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled, with the other machines serving as spares.
First the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are available in larger quantities, were preferred.
Only when it became clear that the E 94 could not be further increased, did the E 95 come into focus.
First the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They came to the railway depot at Halle P in 1960.
They were mostly used in a dedicated circuit, hauling coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
So it was not uncommon for guards to stick around after their shift ended.
Then Beimann, who was always travelling on this locomotive, had to release the shooter during the journey with a hammer and wooden spike.
Damage to the traction motors was more common and resulted in months of downtime for the locomotive.
By the end of the 1960s there were enough new build locomotives available and there was no plan to extend the electrified network, so the Reichsbahn could dispense with old locomotives and most split-fleet types, with the result that the E 95s were taken out of service.
In addition, with them, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to only use electric locomotives crewed by one man, which would have caused problems in train operation due to the difficulties mentioned above with the machines and the view from the driver's cab.
After being withdrawn in the middle of 1969, the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were followed by the E 95 01, which retired on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was never used.
With the exception of the E 95 02, all locomotives have been dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a heating unit on the main railway station in Halle.
It took some time for those responsible at the Reich Railway to be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive underwent initial external restoration in order to be able to present it at a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
It has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive since then.
In 1986 the internal completion of the locomotive was carried out.
The locomotive is cared for at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995 employees of the traditional association Bw Halle P have been working on the operational processing of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented to the public at an exhibition in the Museum Bw Arnstadt for the first time, with a new internal and external livery, while the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian mountain railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves reliable in service due to their dependable drive trains and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945, the machines were transferred to Leipzig for the Middle German network.
The main area of deployment was initially Silesia
Handcraft model H0 in OVP, functioning well, it is necessary to do some optical repairs to the locomotive in your own time, dusty, with toy tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handcraft model, a small edition – possibly the building set also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can bear labels and storage marks.
If you extend the voucher, I shall place a larger order, but nevertheless I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected, I could not imagine and have not been able to call and clarify at the right time.
But I as a customer do not accept that.
So when could the cupboard be delivered?
It is not an option for me...
Extra stress before holiday and weekend weeks
This topic came up for me last week.
I had to use my long weekend to unwind.
That's why a post is being put in now.
Not only in the run-up to major holidays, such as Christmas, there is a lot of stress in our company.
It seems there is one for every holiday period.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is semi-official.
So it was a long 4-day weekend last week.
What happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
According to emails that absolutely had to be sent before departure, order here, order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Parce que... oui, parce que?
Because "next week then" after so much time doesn't sound right?
Or is it because people really want to do so much in a short week as they do in a normal week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also incredibly nervous.
What should this self-sacrifice for holidays?
Why do we still have holidays when we can't really enjoy them?!
The stress did not come from above; the colleagues were all completely self-sufficient.
My question is: Are we the only ones like this, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north too?
That's perfect! Do I need anything else?
They just need the tracking number in my email?
Companies pay vaccine fees and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees money for vaccination.
In doing so, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German example - should increase people's readiness to have the Corona vaccination.
I had a huge argument with you when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# wardrobe.
I'm for everyone using pronouns
I have sent an application.
The invitation to talk came by email today.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
But unfortunately the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and according to where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Could someone please help me?
** I'm an alien and I don't want to step on anyone's toes.
Conclusion: everyone should get used to pronouns.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
But there were none left.
Now they are back in stock and I want to add the two chairs to my order and charge it to you.
When does the deadline expire?
According to the Distance Selling Act, I have a right to cancel for one month.
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is coming and the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have something enchanting about them, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still brings our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important, then, to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a "peace-promoting 'social contract' of pre-industrial societies", can dispel the rigid routine and acquire new life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became Christkind
To be strictly correct, it was the Protestants who tied the Christmas days closely with the giving of presents.
Previously, gifts were handed over on St. Nicholas Day.
The background to this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, is said to have thrown three women a bag of gold down their chimney in one night so that they could live another life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving birth to the German tradition of filling children's shoes with gifts.
Protestants objected to this practice because they reject intermediaries between God and human beings as "idolatry."
For these reasons, they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made Saint Nicholas into Christ Child and founded a new tradition.
The focus of the giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
As most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions as a matter of course, only a few are now annoyed that the custom of Saint Nicholas is still closely linked with Martin's day, with Martin singing and Martin's procession.
Today, one can find shoes in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, ranging from socks to coveted luxury watches, all of which the heart desires.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources confirm a tradition of giving on the day of St Nicholas that dates back to the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all the Christian countries, however, there is a happy babble about who is now going to bring the gifts for the children.
In Germany it depends on the region as to whether it is the Christkind or Father Christmas who appears on Christmas Eve. In principle, Father Christmas is a kind of Nikolaus who over time has been assigned some distinctive traits.
This includes his white beard, which has little in common with the more severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer but three horses that pull his sledge as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars, the Christ Child is responsible for passing on the gifts.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this is returned and that I will have a full refund.
This is also pretty sad, because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
Yes, that's what I believe, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket sent to Germany
Can you check that?
Reference: Lesson planning (EK)
Salut chères collègues et collègues,
I have been in the Ref since the summer, teaching is fun, but I currently have big problems scheduling my lessons in geography in a timely manner.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so in practice I can only use the whiteboard, textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school I can only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
At the moment I simply need a long time to plan my hours.
For example at the moment we are talking about geofactors, and for me every hour is actually a separate topic.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I need that time for UBs etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then I think of how I can build this up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
That's why the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really appreciate it.
Career in social work - as someone with a narcissistic personality disorder?
I studied software development and have now been learning for about a year.
Unfortunately, however, I am more and more aware that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering for a long time to start again and study social work.
The problem: I have an avoidant (or fearful) personality disorder (AVPD).
To put it bluntly, it means that I have no self-esteem and am correspondingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it's very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I've been told I come across as unapproachable (which I believe I'm better at now).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth drop-in, I'd rather work in things like drug counselling or family support.
But I don't know if the concrete working day is really like I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find something about it on the Internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because every time it pulls me down when there is something to be criticised in my code ("just simple things messed up again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how this goes by now"/"I take them off work with my stupid questions"/"he has to put up with me being half-educated" etc.).
I will probably have problems in every profession but I wanted to mention it.
I searched for a return address label for my order #NUMBER last week and this morning.
I was told one would be sent to me.
Since I haven't received one yet (not even in the SPAM folder), I wanted to ask how long this usually takes.
Many thanks.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her latest novel "Daheim" ("At Home") on Friday evening in the sold-out Blue Note, and also acted as host.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and is attuned to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I received my order today, unfortunately it is a different color and the surface is scratched and the table leg has a print.
The first delivery was the same color as on the website.
We are very disappointed!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or what?
The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# wholesale customer and therefore it is not a problem for me.
All I need is a number or instruction of what to do with the package so it can be tracked as a return for you.
Could you please help me find the title of a book?
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost all of the plot, but the title completely escapes me...
The story was about fear and how to overcome it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by showering himself with food and going into the enclosure with his lions.
The case is taken on by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, accuses his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and goes to this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of the suicide and document it and put the photos online.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist is actually running an underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses fear centres in the brain and patients ultimately face their fears to an extreme.
(a woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to death)
This is described in the book as "the fight."
In the end, there's a big showdown at the hospital where the fire took place.
That's the rough translation I am quite sure that the book was written by a French author / author.
If this action is known to someone or if someone can even tell me the title of the book I would be very happy.
It was completely different: when I was at school I realised that many religious education teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them like maths or geography.
For me, this was always something strange, perhaps also because I was brought up Christian and I always had some kind of faith.
How do you feel about it?
Maybe you can also tell stories with different attitudes from work and or study colleagues.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be odd to have a physics teacher who did not believe in relativity theory.
What brings someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe it?
Culture or something like that?
I hope your question is not too private.
Hello, have you already sat on the #PRS_ORG chairs?

Car crashes into tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old hit a central reservation on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for unknown reasons and then veered onto the wrong side of the road, according to police.
There was a head-on collision with a car driven by a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then hurled into a tree, crushing the man in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least Johannes Patrick on the Youngsters was reliable.
Again nothing: For the second time within not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick looked back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
That didn't change after the game - quite the contrary: 61-72 (28-38)
Where more than just the bare result disappointed the way of the appearance.
To put it another way, a statistic is quoted that expresses the entire dilemma: the three-pointer quota was a mere 13 percent; four goals (all by young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - any more questions?
The response came from John Patrick: "We were just not focused enough after the victory in Tenerife and did not implement what we had trained for."
That is, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted completely differently: "A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like 10,000 people.
There were only 750 spectators allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team to victory.
The best playmaker that I have ever coached, said Gleim.
While in Patrick's team even the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed all over the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came within eight points of catching up after they had already trailed by 39-59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for arguing.
Already on Wednesday (8 p.m.) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg up to 750 spectators.
I had already given everything to her colleague.
Written and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what was replied to my concern.
I always have to work and answer the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
It doesn't help much because I've waited since September.
Is the full amount refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
So that the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the parts with some soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the non-existent inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first stroke on the building component
Draw the brush evenly, stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers ensures a even surface later.
Avoid rapid back and forth wiping with the brush.
This results in unrealistically large areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colours come to a close with a separate brush.
Otherwise there can be unpleasant metal streaks when they mix with normal colours.
Leave the painted parts to dry for a day before you sand them.
The models get their authentic look with the decals or stickers.
From flags on aircraft to the names of ships to decoration on automobile models: Decals give the model the final touch.
Bring the decals in the right order, while the parts are still easily accessible.
A plane's cockpit can be covered before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut each required decal out individually and stick them down.
Decals are also called water transfer images, because you briefly wet the back of them with water until the carrier paper turns dark from the moisture.
Then you just peel it off the paper and stick it in place on the model (which you have also wet first).
While you hold the decal in place on the model with a tool, you peel the carrier paper away from the side.
Attention: Always check that the picture is stuck down properly before you peel it away from the paper, so it doesn't stick to your fingers, knuckles or tears.
Remove excess water with a towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation.
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could now buy it!
What should I do?
To put it quite clearly.
RBTV has made many promises.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply the case that the politics of this broadcaster have become utterly discredited.
Every format is sponsored (OK), but then to go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one was an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote from Arno: "You don't want to be a running billboard."
What are we now?
A 0815 advertiser who is trying to get his billboard to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
The ones that apply to everyone, except for Simon and Etienne.
They can of course continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and is trying to make a name for himself at the expense of the action with the exploded premises.
How should one find all that well?
It's horrible if you like it.
Tyre choice on a racing bike - really so safe?
This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to at least do a little training for my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I went for a ride on my new road bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40 km were really beautiful - but then that happened which lurks in every city centre (this time: thank you Krefeld)!
Shards of glass on the track.
Zack, loud snapping and my rear tyre definitely did not want to participate in the rest of the stretch.
Since I had no real possibility on a weekday to get a replacement coat and hose, I had to content myself with half-hearted good cheer and take the first train back home.
Then it was not quite so bad, perhaps it is even better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike ride.
But now I'm faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
As I have a relatively long stretch ahead of me over several days, I would extremely dislike to get this problem more often.
It was not so bad now, as the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who drove until 2pm until I picked up the bike!) had also been described as suboptimal by him, because he had driven them for years.
But if I think about the fact that I have to change a tire after driving 80-90km, then I am really in a bad mood:D
Now I have been talking to an older man at the platform, who asked me why I did not have the Marathon Plus tyres; they are supposed to be impossible to puncture.
Now, of course, it all sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I'm not really in the mood to spend €40/tyre just to be disappointed.
In addition, I ask myself: at the moment I believe I am cycling 25 x 622.
There are also (apparently?) wider tyres for the Marathon Plus, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend other tyres for a road bike?
The swallow page seems to be my absolute! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you already in advance for the help and loving greetings!
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.
Yesterday, #NAME# sent me an email confirming the commissioning of
Contact made with the shipping company to arrange collection of the wrongly delivered table.

I have now been writing to the third support staff member, with no one getting past the promise that I would receive an email confirmation.
It is the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
The tabletop for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people.

The "drive" of a tube output stage is a major contributor to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-control, you can set both the desired level and the clipping of your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without altering the "gain" and distortion.
Further up, it sounded as if you could even use the POWER LEVEL control to create a reserve performance level if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line out.
The audio signal applied here is processed with a boxing simulation so that, even when using headphones or for direct recordings, you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression.
AUX can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so you can jam out to your favorite songs.
There is also a tuner function - so you don't need a separate voice recorder.
Anyone who also buys a VFS5 foot controller can conveniently call up the sounds using their feet, switch the effect blocks on/off and change the tempo of the compatible effects "on the fly".
This is actually essential for live deployment.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!

Minor deviations from the nominal properties, which are unimportant for the value and usability of the tool.
We will remedy the deficiency which we have recognised as subject to guarantee in the following way: we will repair your defective tool free of charge or replace it with a functioning tool (possibly also a successor model) of our choice.
Replacement tools or parts become our property.
Can I cancel my order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise they would not be allowed to sell it as an office chair.
In any case, the guarantee of 24 months applies.
Thank you, I found it.

Serious "skinhead" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "swindler"?
With this dialect word, sent in by someone from Amberg, there was a lot to think about in the BR television programme "Wir in Bayern".
But, for the first time in many days, the term "Host mi?" went unanswered by callers.
No, it was not "a guy who is nervous."
And also nobody, "who has to do everything quickly".
That, people heard from the TV presenter, is completely wrong.
This is what the man from Amberg had to say about it, and probably also surprised many people in Upper Palatinate.
The skinflint, the viewers learned, "is a rag that someone uses to wipe the stove".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert by Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this was a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the rather well-known dialect word "Houdern".
This has closed a gap in education - probably also for many who have lived in Amberg for a long time.
I'm fed up with Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on the German Sky has been getting worse and worse, so I thought I would take a break with this post.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted during the F2 race in the middle to start the F1 build-up at the scheduled time.
True, the schedule was way behind due to the delayed start and the crash, but they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes, and the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky DE had no choice here.
Still, dumb, especially as Sky UK has cut away from the race.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then the F1 commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher made a mistake, they did not know that one can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although there was a similar situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the decision that Verstappen could change his tyres only when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators on Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen.
I think such elementary rules should be known by anyone who is commentating on a pay-TV F1.
It is also not the first riddle that is now possible or mandatory according to the rules, both have simply constant uncertainties in the subject of the rules.
In general, Roos does not like the artificial commentary style, but it is a matter of taste.
But there, I actually prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL.
In addition, there are constant stupidities, which make both of them appear unprofessional, as in the case of ordering coffee for the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke, or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter one causes a lot of unrest in the comment, which he obviously does not take seriously.
Not least, advertising has simply taken over at Sky; in the commercial break, Sky is the only channel that goes to advertising, as can be seen on F1TV, where there is only the German soundtrack without commentary, directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF are doing that.
These two channels also do less advertising in training than Sky, and as free-to-air channels.
It is true that one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programme is very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster of F1.
Seriously, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
So anyway, the grandiose F1 season is a lot less fun than it would be with a decent broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
I completed the contact form to return an item yesterday, but have not received an email confirmation or similar.
My question would be, have you received my request?
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest coronavirus incidence
Thüringen has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in the country.
As the only federal state, its value is above the mark of 1000.
On Sunday, Thuringia was the only federal state in which the number of cases exceeded 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value at 1025 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always had the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had dropped slightly, but was still above 1000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new cases of infection with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within a day.
200 seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
There can be delays at weekends.
In addition, health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and can hardly keep up with the new cases.
Could you please send me any transaction number... or anything else that could help?
Transfert confirmation... etc
It is time for change
Greetings Bundestag, I am StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why the post here?
If you take a look at the Bundestag's activity over the past few months, one thing is clear: it doesn't exist.
We have got into a winter rut and extended the summer hole for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what happened?
For the most part, this is simply a case of general dissatisfaction, as there are a few things that have gone wrong and we are generally unhappy.
In the last few days, there has been a growing sense that many here still really want to go to the federal conference.
What we need to change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag wants to know which of them wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who recently became aware of this project and found a, simply put, mountain of shards.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community found each other and decided to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to call on everyone again to participate, only in this way can this project also have a future.
To this end, we have set up a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with one another, and work on concrete things.
You can join the server over this link.
Objectifs:
* How should the Bundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* Comment should new members be recruited?
How do we achieve a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot some things, but it's not the end of the world, we have Discord for that.
If you're up for it and have the time, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's democratically decide the future.
What you are describing will be referred to as *Awareness* or consciousness under general anesthesia.
They occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
The most common experience is hearing noises/voices, rarely seeing images, and almost never feeling pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with a higher rate of awareness since, in order to protect the child, very deep anesthesia is avoided until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Specific anaesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine describes Awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex did not have it by definition.**
I misread her comment.
Why is the shipment not starting until 16 March?
There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time.
Chat connection is gone and now?
I also have to work sometimes!
Bonjour!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the #PRS_ORG day tent in blue/green.
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
I had not restarted the e-#PRS_ORG# before purchase.
Should I do that now?
We didn't do anything with the chair.
The tear was there all of a sudden.
I just sat there.
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I cannot see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cupboard will be removed promptly.
And I beg you to do so now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will do my best to take the shelf out of the way for collection - they will have to sort out with #PRS_ORG how that is going to work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by telephone at any time to arrange a collection date.
Our little one has slept on her stomach from week 1.
Fast Forward: Still Alive :D
Relax.
So a child holds much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything else is right, no cuddly toys, go in more often and have a look but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
And we didn't have a sleeping bag, we always had a blanket.
Watch your child sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it get up from the stomach?
Or is it with the face to the front, directly in the mattress?
You can derive from that whether everything is in order.
We've all grown up and when my husband was born it was a bit of a squeeze, but you just put the kids to sleep on your stomach.
I also want to send the lamp back.
How should I proceed?

Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still has not been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday she would check and send it and she has never replied.
Where there is still Christmas ham in Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you not ordered any chicken yet?
Time is running out now.
We tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the loupe should be positioned as close as possible to the eye.
The specially shaped achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifier free of distortion and color aberrations right up to the edge.
Frequently, loupes are marked with magnification specifications.
However, these figures apply only to exactly defined conditions that rarely correspond to the operating conditions.
In order to use your loupe optimally, we ask you to take note of the information in the "Technical data" table (See the instructions manual in the packaging).
On the surface of all optical devices - even in impact lenses - light reflexes are created.
Anti-reflection coatings significantly reduce these reflections.
If the ideal usage conditions are met - the loupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
For more information, please refer to the enclosed operating instructions (available in German and English).

Darmstadt second after first half - Pauli wins in Dusseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 are working their way out of the relegation zone.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt under their third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hanover about interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed start under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
What happens now?
What happened to the books? How do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I get by
OK.
We will no longer order anything from them.
When they add my and my friend #NAME's (same address) sales they've obviously lost a good customer.
They are happy to pass this on to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Must the cupboard be completely dismantled for removal and refund?
And when would the pickup be?
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund was initiated and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back.
Well, I can't do anything about the fact that the wardrobe is completely upside down when it arrives with me.
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote
There it is clear and unmistakable that the repayment was caused and I still have not received any repayment via #PRS_ORG
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I cannot open the book.
I have followed her recommendations, removed and reloaded the app, but NOTHING has worked.
I am a little frustrated because the whole operation has already cost me a lot of time and I hope now for help.
To weaken fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021
Until now, Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin has not made a public statement about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend prompted him to do it, said Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false messages on social media saying that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," wrote Sahin on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
'For the past few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counteract these false rumours.'
Up to now he has rejected this because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old schoolfriend was currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 infection and has been attached to a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
However, "the most frequent cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and distrust."
It is hard to fight fear with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the internet there is an interview with Deutsche Welle in which Uğur Şahin says that he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the German broadcaster itself made clear.
I am not allowed by law to get the vaccine myself at the moment, Şahin said at the time.
There is a priority in Germany for the vaccination.
By now, the priority has long been lifted - and the biontech boss has had himself vaccinated three times, according to his own statements.
110 kV underground cable to be newly built in 2022
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision makes way for the construction, which is set to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the commune and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning near Reut to a mast of the overhead line.
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would be pleased to pay for the return.
Eight euro return fee is in my opinion a cheek.
The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Thanks to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of just 30mm x 15.5mm, and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive of the H0 and 0 scales.
LokSound 5 decoders are available with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker plus speaker kit.
Like all members of the family, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
He masters the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are so self-evident as two- and four-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders connect to a suitable digital centre automatically.
He masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main track.
For centres that can only program the CVs of 1 to 255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola users benefit from up to 28 floors at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola® addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
An embedded programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration with mfx-compatible central systems.
The LokSound 5 Decoder recognises Märklin® brake tracks as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
It is also possible to brake using DCC brake building blocks or with constant voltage.
In addition, he also holds a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC ticket machine allows automatic travel between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC trains.
Often on tour and still lots of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
The 20-litre volume can also accommodate larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stowed using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And anything else you need for daily use is organised well and separable from the photo equipment in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design speaks for itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the rucksack while still providing instant access to photo equipment.
This works in two ways: either conventionally via the flap cover, which can be secured with the MagLatch closure system, a superbly thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proved itself on the messenger bags.
In the closing flap there is a metal latch with matching anchoring bars on the front of the rucksack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has had different "filling levels" in mind: there are four anchor points, solidly welded, to which the latch can be attached.
If the rucksack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a lower one.
Folding shutters and hooks are also magnetic.
This means that the rucksack can be closed securely without jamming the hook.
The second possibility, the Everyday Backpack, differs fundamentally from other photo backpacks: in addition to the flap, there is also a tear-off opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional rucksacks with access from above - you no longer have to rummage through the content!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the suitability of the rucksack for everyday use: If, in addition to your photo equipment, you are also taking everyday items or travel luggage.
With the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more about this below) and so separate the two easily without any problems - and access them via the two side openings.
You can also pull the rucksack on from the right-hand side to access the camera equipment in the right main pocket, while everyday essentials stay safe in the left rucksack pocket and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easy-to-disguise support belts help.
And since the exterior of the rucksack is also made from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content stays dry even when it's going to rain in Scotland in the autumn.
Hello, I just saw that they are sold out of #NAME.
That is very sad.
Is it still produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
Community worker contradicts constitution
Hallo r/LegaladviceFrench,
J'ai le suivant problème.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
Furthermore, an application for eviction was filed with the municipality.
A staff member writes to me that felling fruit trees is not part of the by-laws.
The walnut tree is specifically mentioned as a protected tree in the statutes.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on expert opinions.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Merci pour vos réponses.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the abolition of the test obligation for triple vaccination
The health ministers of the states want to decide on their next meeting about a nationwide abolition of the test obligation for triple vaccination.
We need clarity quickly as to whether and from when for three times vaccinated people the test obligation can be waived, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The withdrawal of 2G plus for triple vaccination is "not only medically sensible, but also gives an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has confirmed that "he will submit a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on Tuesday". - afp
Shame, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(

I did not receive it and therefore could not cash it, which is why I have finally asked.
Last year, because of Corona, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now it's gone, which makes me very angry.
Looking at the chat, it was about the Asare sofa.
Hello #NAME#, is it possible to get a small sample of the wood beforehand?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we can check in advance whether it matches the colour
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the south fork of the American River discovered shiny nuggets in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and prosperous towns in the country.
Tracts were laid out, tents pounded, and saloons and hotels arose almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many it was: “Coloma or bust” (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer, seeking wealth in the West and seeking to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, breed horses, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river systems and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - it seems the other pioneers had the same idea!
You have to outperform your fellow pioneers to avoid going bust with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to manage your resources and build a tableau which works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions or change the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays out over the course of three years, from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is unveiled and they place their pioneers in the right locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a block!
This deactivates half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, exploring rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning gunmen.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The sponsor rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, thereby changing the available actions.
This goes on for so long that the advertiser has moved five times, so that each location has been covered once and the year ends.
There's a shootout where players must defend Coloma from a bandit attack.
If the players have recruited enough gunmen and are numerically superior to the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is determined.
The player with the most victory points wins!
With free shipping, I take the packaging dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
With everything else, usually DPD insured and with delivery tracking (games inserted, flies wound up and bubble wrap).
If you are a collector, then I can also send the cardboard in a cardboard envelope for 2 euros, which means there will be no creases.
In the name of the people: Lay people pass judgement
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the judge's bench.
But a lot depends on her verdict, even if she is not wearing a robe: jurors work with professional judges to decide whether and for how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them talk to "Öffentliche" about their time at the Bad Kreuznach district court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the district court on John F. Kennedy Strasse.
I would be happy, had already ordered and received the same chair in blue in November. Therefore, because they are so beautiful, I now have one in grey.
Yes, what I don't understand, I have also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I have already ordered in November.
Here: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, metal and multi-coloured glass x 1
But that's how others have seen it.
Is it possible to send the lamp back to you?
Because it's too low for over a dinner table?
I would also like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
Shame, I would have liked to have stayed with you, but if the discount is not credited to me, then I will not order again in principle.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
During the lockdown, no tree nursery has opened...
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no presents yet.
The beautiful, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get ready for the festival by baking and decorating cookies with her son.
I love it, said Catterfeld.
Until the thoughtful days, however, she has a few things to do: "For the first time I still don't have any gifts, I have to finally wrap them up".
Thank you anyway!
Then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Will it be a problem to get it back?
The chair is broken though.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros are not helping us.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective seat.
This is in addition to the legal obligation, which is also standard in the eCommerce sector.
Please check if they can at least take away the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose money there.
Sorry but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite does not mean anything.
That is like when an AfD politician says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah keeps reproducing some antisemitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it completely.
Yeah, wow, you're as unserious as Kollegah.
Anyone who fundamentally questions evolution is simply completely lost.
In any case, a god started the whole thing.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just rubbish.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
But that comes much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
Thank you first of all for being open to the whole thing, I too spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar role, that is to say we were also gun bearers in the executive, and I don't want to go into that any further!
The question of right and left always seems to me to be very simplified.
In principle one should say that of course the state official comes rather from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should actually be clear to everyone.
That of course also includes people on the right who are attracted to magic because of their uniforms and weapons. And of course everyone knows that these people then have difficulty dealing with the reality they experience, because of course you are immediately aware that alongside the average white person, you now have many people with a migration background, women, and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the overly feminine stereotype, because there are hardly any of those in the executive, just normal men and women, whom one doesn't notice are gay), and I can rely on these people too, because in doubt they will save your life or sacrifice it for you.
But even these fringe groups, it seems to me, adopt a conservative attitude, that is to say, they are proud of Germany and feel that they have been let down by excessive left-wing policies, even if these policies are supposedly aimed at them and they are meant to be set right by them. They just want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, because of course the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will find extreme right there as well, but they are openly allowed to say their opinion there or even hatch any state-damaging plans, which is completely overblown by the media and annoys me as well.
Of course, sometimes even police officers and soldiers, who were often on foreign deployment, begin to generalise because of negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing minded people meet and exchange ideas.
Nevertheless, such things are well combated and counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined and that is a good thing, in my opinion, because we could never afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I/Mrs #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a renewed order of the #PRS_ORG night table and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
The package still wants to go to #PRS_ORG.
Please contact me.
With kind regards
Good day - I am interested in the Boone dining table, white.
Is it also available in large 230cm?
And the wardrobe?
Will we get another update on the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
I want the #PRS_ORG to be delivered to my room.
How can I book that?
Please cancel the reservation.
That will then be relevant in law.
I'm taking a screenshot.
Until when do you plan to stay?
If the delivery cannot be made to my home, I must cancel the order!
IEs is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I received an email on 18.01. stating that the refund had been processed.
But to date the money has not been paid in.
Could you please check that.
In addition, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought a lot of articles
But why are you only offering me 20 euros?
No, only if I press on tiptoe comes an extra field with the message
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Bonjour chères filles et girls et femmes,
I have a few things I want to write about and perhaps it will interest the one - or others too...
I'm 24, have kPTBS, am a full-time student and a dog mum - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (we've been together for 6J) is ill, he got second-degree burns on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now getting therapy).
Yesterday I went to visit him, because I have emotional needs as well, and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him wash because his hand was in a bandage due to burns.
On top of that, he is cold and we currently see each other less (1-2x per week), which is causing me a lot of trouble with regard to my need for affection and love.
My dog is suffering from stomach ache, I have cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I have warmed the lamp and stroked him.
I live with my sister and my mother, and she's away for a month.
Now we also have to do household chores, which we will of course divide between us.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS is set just right, I am half-way through treatment and coming to terms with it.
Not great, but I get by and am almost symptom-free.
My uni is currently asking a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything, and the next day I have an anatomy lecture for which I should at least prepare a bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and then what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no room for it there.
That's how my week is going too: Just until tomorrow afternoon, then it's the weekend.
But then, does it all just go on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental placeholders because otherwise I'd go insane.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't manage otherwise...
Is it the same for you?
Ehrlich, I am endlessly grateful that I don't have to work.
Seriously, I can't even begin to express how grateful I am.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think that also has something to do with the mental load that women carry and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you a pleasant evening, the week is almost over!
Due to Omikron: Johnson wants to promote booster vaccination
New Omikron cases keep politicians and scientists in the UK busy.
This is why all adults in England who are eligible should receive an offer of the vaccine by New Year.
London - The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, wants to move faster than planned in the course of the Corona vaccination campaign, given the rapidly increasing number of Omikron cases.
Every adult in England should already have had the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since their second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots on Sunday evening.
Until now, the target date has been the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support so that the vaccination campaigns can be accelerated in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the Omikron variant, one is faced with an emergency situation, which means that the vaccination protection must be stepped up, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be raised again with a third vaccination dose.
Let's boost now, said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more cases of Omicron were recorded in the UK, taking the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
I can no longer handle my #PRS_ORG purchases.
Error: Oops, something went wrong.
Shopping over the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated my contact data.
What could be the cause of this?
The decorative light fits harmoniously into every bed, garden area or stone garden.
The light is simply positioned and can be secured with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lifetime max. 10 days.
- The robust plastic extrusion can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone makes this solar light fascinating – either in white or coloured light (in six different colours).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberate: this modern light object presents itself as a naturally formed large pebble during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where it can hold its own thanks to its size.
You can save a lot of work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires neither a power supply nor wiring.
Set the "luminous stone" on a popular, sunlit square.
Two delivered sausages provide stability if required.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides the "Smart Stone" discreetly in its interior, together with his battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for coloured light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the case.
As twilight falls, "Smart Stone" begins to glow of its own accord; you can choose the colour yourself: There are six attractive light colours to choose from – in addition to daylight white.
The switching off is also automatic in the end, once the battery charge has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it gets light again.
As soon as the sun reappears, the charging cycle begins again the next day.
Okay, c'est comme ça.
I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS_ORG collection in June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?
I find such a low discount almost unbelievable.
We are not in agreement with that
NEKTON Bio supports a smooth moulting process and new feather formation.
NEKTON Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy coat.
The majority of feather damages occurring in bird husbandry are the result of dietary errors.
Since the feathers consist of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather coat.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the moulting period are due to inadequate or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant foods is explicitly taken into account and balanced out.
While NEKTON Bio is being used, no other vitamin preparation should be given.
NEKTON Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or feed.
After my voucher was not extended because of a complaint that did not reach me, I will place an order worth around
Take #NUMBER#€ out of my shopping basket and order somewhere else where the customer service is friendlier and I don't have to fumble around not achieving anything at all!
What should I do with this number then?
The trade is worried about Christmas business because of the 2G ruling.
Only those who are vaccinated or have recovered are allowed into most businesses.
The trade considers this to be unnecessary and complains about a fall in profits.
He also has a possible solution at hand.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are depriving retailers of important Christmas business.
Sales of non-daily goods are falling, complained HDE managing director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies looked at the remaining days of the year negatively.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit, said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions therefore lost around a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It is only going well in the grocery sector and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
′′ 2G shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic ", he stressed.
The current regulations scared customers away and required a high level of personnel.
The bandage rule must be permitted nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access that day to all shops with the band received.
In addition, individual retailers - as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - should only have to carry out sample checks.
The property company Deutsche EuroShop, which specialises in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at about 75 percent of the pre-corona level without 2G, and turnover was at about 90 percent.
These figures will certainly fall in the middle of the important Christmas business," said Chief Executive Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personal and administrative effort, the centres are trying to find solutions and get them approved.
This also includes the so-called wristband solution, with "visitors, for example, having to present their 2G proof at a central point in the centre and then, with a wristband like those used in a club hotel, be able to enter all the shops without any problems". dpa

House fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in an apartment building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-figure euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport onto the adjacent house in Kinsau (district of Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reportedly taken to hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The precise cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not rule out deliberate arson.
The Criminal Investigation Department of Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
but there is one in particular

“Arcane” on Netflix: What is the series about “League of Legends”?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, an amazing production: "Arcane", the series set in the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we excited about the already announced two seasons?
First on the #PRS_ORG.
That has been the case for about.
14 days no more.
This is why I have always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG.
After the publication of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new blood again.
SOLO 15 is the new offshoot and is reminiscent of the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM, optically.
However, a suitably designed foot is included in this construction proposal to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted to suit the circumstances at home.
By principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom the maximum sound level plays only a rather subordinate role, but the sound should achieve an exceptionally high level of quality.
A 10 cm speaker just isn't capable of generating nearly unfiltered sound pressure levels of this magnitude.
However, that does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably mature and strikingly impressive for its size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-end lift.
This is a general practice with broadband to optimise the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is precisely aimed at the listening position and convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
The treble range can be gently turned down and the sound made warmer in this way.
Thanks to the point source, the location of the individual components of a musical piece is measured with exquisite sharpness and precision in the optimal stereo triangle.
The suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM create a hostile dynamic that seeks its equal.
The SOLO 15 thus supplements not only our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our builds, it pays to give some thought to the final aesthetic of the speaker at the outset, in order to incorporate any necessary changes into the build.
For example, if you want to veneer the housing, the lowering of the speaker must be adapted accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
After all the plates had been cut to shape (e.g. in the DIY shop), a 8 mm hole should be drilled in the floor panel at the appropriate point, so that the cable could be led through there without any problems later.
With the help of a jig, the speaker opening is now following in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later on.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase in order to design the opening surface of the speaker chassis as large as possible.
The four connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
After that, you begin to build the box itself, placing one of the two side walls on a flat surface.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now glued on.
The three reinforcements should also be installed and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in thickness if required, depending on whether you want to use pre-cut strips from the timber store rather than cut your own from 16mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be installed.
Then come all the plates of the foot, that is, the two sides, and the front.
By means of a suitable hole saw or Forstner drill, the installation of the openings in the bass reflex port, as well as the connection clip on the rear wall, is facilitated.
Finally, a rounding tool is used to smooth all the edges of the actual box.
The top surface of the footrest can also be rounded off with it.
Afterwards, the bottom plate is firmly glued to the bottom of the housing and additionally screwed in with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) the fixing points on the speaker chassis and the connector clamp.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suck up / blow out), you can begin laying the cable.
This is easiest to achieve through the 35 mm bass reflex port in the rear wall.
To do this, the entire and uncut cable is pushed through the 8 mm hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, and is left to hang there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and is also loosely hung there.
The frequency changer is then prepared and installed.
The construction plan for the frequency changer, and the corresponding connection plan, can be obtained from the following document: Installation instructions Weiche Solo 15.
When the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
Thanks to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little skill, one can pour hot glue into the opening and seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small torch, you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now, according to the description, comes the dampening.
Next, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and tightened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity is important here, so that the plus lead (marked cable) is connected to the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen vibration, a mat of damping material is cut in two and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex port should be kept open.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Do you also know the legs in bright?
Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the royal palace
A gunman has been shot dead by police near London's Kensington Palace on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man who had gone into a bank and a bookmaker's with a gun.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was stopped a short time later by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Numerous embassies are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Hello, I have a question about your #PRS_ORG series.
These products are advertised with additional purchasing hooks, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
I ordered the #PRS_ORG a couple of days ago... for €249.
Today it costs 179€.
I find that very annoying.
Do I need to cancel the order and reorder at the better price or is there another way to credit the account?
Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: Women in Krembz search for Christmas trees
Frank Diers, a farmer, has already witnessed many curious situations when selling Christmas trees.
Once, a man drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree on anything.
Every year he plants around 2000 of them.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas period a bit of fun, he says.
Always like out of the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He manages to excite his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
At the moment he is on tour with the "Good Day, Lucky Love" programme - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "at the request of the authorities" to contain the Corona virus.
His other performances planned for Advent are also having to be cancelled for the time being, as it says on the website of the singer, who is 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists then want to catch up their already postponed 2020 dates due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian town of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing as a young man.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, together with his fellow students, he founded the Palace Orchestra.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place in the charts - just like his successful album "For Women, This Isn't a Problem" (2013).
He has made it from the niche into the mainstream.
Dressed impeccably, with his blond hair cut in a strict style, Max Raabe is unmistakable in the current German-speaking music scene.
Since 2020, he has been touring with the "Good day, lucky love" programme. dpa
How do you respond to the question of why you're vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself lived as a vegetarian for a while, and doesn't eat meat that often at the moment.
I myself was also a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned stepping stone, I answered honestly without much thought.
In fact, I used to think that by being a vegetarian I would be helping the animal cause, but somewhere along the line I reflected on this and realised that I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
That's why I decided to go vegan.
In that moment I got the impression that she was annoyed, she then defended vegetarianism and said that she knows where her meat comes from and that vegetarians reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, one is quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise, which one would not want.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;
It is clear that this is not an exception under section 312d BGB.
Their #PRS_ORG# do not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no possibility of keeping them for so long.
We would use the table as if it were theirs.
The feeling of not being able to help.
Content warning: I will be writing a bit more detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to get something off my chest.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really nags me and unfortunately occurs way too often is that many victims don't seek help or think we could not help them.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything in those situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even when speaking to them face-to-face, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of taking the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to simply suffer violence.
I often wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
It will never get any easier.
Please remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so invaluable.
Infertility treatment for PKV / What is a "claim"?
Hallo zusammen,
For a while we were in the fertility treatment, now suddenly it comes up with the bill for the PKV.
One after the other:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the PKV and were given the go-ahead for three attempts.
The experiments were in no way restricted (e.g. by time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
A few months later we tried for a second child and had 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count the PKV in.
We again applied for the costs to be covered by the PKV and were again granted 3 further attempts.
After a few more tries (we did more tries than agreed, logically the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 tries (2+3) the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 tries.
The reason for this is that with the pregnancy/birth the other two attempts of the first commitment become void.
The second pregnancy is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, "The insurance case begins with the course of treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
Who has the right, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (there are 5 attempts to reimburse)?
Would the PKV have had to point out to us in the contract that the further attempts would fail with a birth?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Half victory against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher at the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) explained.
This state of suspension - Belarus is not giving in entirely, but the EU feels it is the winner - is likely to go on for a while longer.
The treatment of people on the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, ruled Bossong.
Apparently, there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided to do so, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion in the Union.
If a member state gets it into its head to do its own thing, it is apparently unable to enforce itself, as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU's border protection agency, Frontex, to access its borders.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, says Bossong: an agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult, since the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
New attempt at crossing the border
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have again attempted to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border protection recorded 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening a group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border fences.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or tried to do so.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko of being the ruler in Minsk, having attracted him with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines carrying migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU commissioners have travelled to countries of origin to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU reaction was the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
The EU has thrown its weight around as a market player and demonstrated its determination to operate with coercive measures and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take account of internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not expecting the security apparatus to regularly sneak thousands of people through the country.
C'est bien, merci.
I am expecting a reply at the earliest by next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME.
Fire in substation: Ten thousand people without power
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the lights went out on Friday evening: no more current and in many cases no heating either.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia were without power for around 24 hours.
The fire caused the lights to go out on Friday evening in the homes of 41,000 people in several communes.
Supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power aggregates had been in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely remedied late in the evening.
Firefighters and volunteers and volunteers of the THW helped in the communities.
Authorities offered support in schools and appealed for help from the community.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and thanked the helpers for their commitment.
We are very much aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless work, said the head of the primary technology sector, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
Repairing the damage will still take a few days, as the Westnetz engineers were only able to put some lines back into operation provisionally at first, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Current flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire which broke out on Friday at 19:15, has damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the substation at Neunkirchen-Seelscheid.
Expensive cleaning and repair works are necessary there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply has been restored.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m. over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 9.30pm.
Since 9.15 p.m. those last affected by the power cut have also had electricity.
More than 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
After setting up emergency power supplies for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also appealed for help from the neighbourhood.
It is important now that citizens look out for their elderly or lonely neighbours, and tell the local fire stations if help is needed, explained district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power supplies, the residents of old people's homes were a priority.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places in schools were set up for those people who were unable to look after themselves or who needed electrical medical equipment or were dependent on medical care.
Nordic Combined: Combined skier Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have made the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to give way again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country race with a large lead after the ski jump.
I have taken the lamp apart again.
And stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That's why I would like to send them back anyway
Can you then let me know if you want to return them, then I can package the lamps and bring them to #PRS_ORG.
Jennifer Aniston emploie une armée de beauté
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is like a rollercoaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, this success is first and foremost the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers cares for their appearance.
After all, she says, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, really: one single chip out of the bag).
The fact that they manage to fly the hearts of female and male fans alike is actually a wonder.
Maybe because she's just unlucky in love - and still searching for the big one.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
Previously, she was constantly being asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
People ask, and I have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It is to be hoped that success and glory will also make one happy.
Someone who works in biochemistry or is studying biochemistry.
I am currently in my first semester studying biochemistry and I find the subject quite exciting and I am not bothered by it in the lab (I have already completed the organic chemistry practical).
Of course, I also investigated the job prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I still thought that I would definitely study until my PhD.
But at the moment I have doubts, especially as far as job prospects are concerned.
On the one side (Studycheck etc) there are always superb career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other side there is always talk of unemployed biologists and incredibly badly paid jobs.
Therefore, I would really be interested:
1) What are you working on at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What have you studied/ What training have you done?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really uncertain and am considering breaking off my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as a specialist in IT.
If you have any experience, please write it down :)
I had returned the contact form or submitted a cancellation via the contact form and wanted to inquire as to whether this had arrived or been dealt with as I have not yet received any confirmation.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the material has a hole in the front part of the seat).
I need help.
In our online shop kitchenpoint.de, we offer all Smeg kitchen appliances and the appropriate accessories.
We generally check the quality and completeness of your order.
The new coffee vending machine from Smeg brings freshly ground coffee into your kitchen or office.
The simple and reduced design, the plastic surface in matt colours combined with the matt-brushed stainless steel front, make the new SMEG coffee machines with milk frother into a design object.
Corresponding to the reduced design, all functions such as grind setting and water quantity, as well as the choice between espresso, americano, ristretto or a mild coffee with only four buttons, can be selected.
Thanks to the steam plant, you can also prepare coffee milk and milk foam specialties.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order had arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Have you received this email?
> Salut à tous,
Finally, we can announce that we will be holding the OSCAST again this year!
Due to well-known reasons, we unfortunately cannot get more than four people in the studio at the same time, which means more planning and the reason for the short notice of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people on the switch so that we can watch the Oscars 2021 with at least seven beans on stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - so we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Get your drinks cold, plan some good eats, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.

Yes, both email addresses
That is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded
Do you have a premium customer status?
It's still about my order which is no longer available.
I have chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros could still be delivered to Germany, or this basket is also available in Germany somewhere.
I always find you as a partner company.
I received a completely different lamp from the one I ordered
Please call me.
The title gives it away: I work as an immunisation doctor in mobile immunisation teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is being administered in care homes.
Since these are soon to be finished to a large extent, it will then go to a vaccination centre for me.
I'm happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organisational and human aspects, and medical questions, so long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, will that interact with the vaccine...").
In my area, I am responsible for providing information about the vaccination, the indication (person has a right to a vaccination according to the coronavirus vaccination decree and no reasons against it), the medical documentation, and, if necessary, emergency care in the event of allergic reactions (this has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have a pharmacist or pharmaceutical assistant, but "only" (please God, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, who, however, cannot carry out (can they?) vaccinations, so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself there.
Bonjour,
My order from 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in part.
The blue Betsell number #PRS_ORG# with the transmission number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the remark "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the further procedure is now?
A beautiful start to the week!
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG, it seems to be on it.
Sobal I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document cannot be opened.
The file may be faulty; please report this to our customer service.
As far as I can tell it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me further?
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically shaped cut, offers maximum comfort, perfect fit and enables almost unrestricted movement.
Forming with a special, further shaping at the joints for improved movement freedom (in arm and knee bends)

Elaskin's 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar region increases flexibility around the waist, improving comfort, especially when bending and when installing and removing equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which sits around the shoulders and down the back, guarantees increased flexibility for arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal on the face of the bonnet increases comfort, the seal and durability (separate headliner)
A soft, fold-over zone improves the seal with a finely adjustable width setting by a flexible, gentle Velcro closure, which does not stick to the casing or the stitching.
Double stitched cuffs with a snap closure connect a detachable inner cuff to a soft, cushioned neoprene exterior cuff
45° inward curve at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and durability when putting on.
Longer zipper at the neck with an elastic reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without cap
Langer G-Lock P back lock with metal bolt and water dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)
Zips on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the break seams to prevent ripping if excessive force is used.
Neoprene panels glued together with external and internal overlapping
Edges of the sleeves lined for greater durability
Edges of the inner cuffs embroidered for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wristwatch computers).
There are various types of palettes.
One of the most common is the Euro pallet, a standardised wooden pallet that is mainly used as a load carrier in the European market.
They are certified by the European pallet association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million palettes were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value amounted to a good 79 million euros.
How many palettes are imported to Austria annually is not recorded
Signed off by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
Will it come by email?
For all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in three separate packages
At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have moved through the USA.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be mourned.
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
On Saturday night, in the USA, several tornadoes caused severe devastation and may have claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave a roughly 320-kilometre-long trail of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster zone that everywhere the tornado went, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He is expecting up to a hundred dead in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official figures are rising hourly.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
In fact, I have already decided on a new one with #PRS_ORG, but I would really like to do the returns as quickly as possible.
Can it not be changed or not? Write me in English, I also understand it well.
That's been a long time, then I would avoid it
Film Search Help Please
Hallo liebe Leute,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I believe it was a film for teenagers.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead).
Since I cannot describe it any closer in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the land of the dead, a young soldier (in uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and an action results.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm so he can live as well.
I believe the transition is also the soldier's grave.
In the end, I think both soldiers will fight each other.
If that's something you want to know, I'm grateful for every answer.
Obviously, the chair had a not visible defect when sold.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months?
Oh no, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that can take time.
What should I do next?
I would like to return it and then order it again as it is currently on offer.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for them.
The team we wanted to throw away: Frankfurt celebrates a goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, Hesse, who had not won for the last two matches in a row, were supposedly on their way to their next Bundesliga collapse.
But then the SGE turned it on, shot the frustration of a mediocre season start from their soul within a good hour and won furiously at 5:2. It is amazing what the boys have achieved today, shouted trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and issued a "general compliment to each and every one who was involved".
It initially looked like a dampener for the now ranked ninth Frankfurt team, who were still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had brought Leverkusen into the lead with 2:0.
What happened then, also impressed the SGE coach.
How the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance, continued Glasner.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth match day and his muscle injury, stressed the morale of his teammates.
I think our mentality is incredible, said the 27-year-old with a view to the result in particular for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the coming tasks, however, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It's unusual to have all the players fit in December, to have all the players physically in a top condition.
It is top-level work in our medical department, but the players also live and work in a highly professional manner.
Now one wants to "go step by step and stay modest" and to "work through" the tasks by the turn of the year "at this level".
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (8.30pm, Sky).
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continued to be developed, which has led to the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X, VT40X and VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state of the art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Naturally, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube pre-amplifier.
This is partly based on real analogue circuits because these simply deal better with the sound variations and nuances of a valve amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated switching system, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed casing and a bass reflex system through which the natural resonances can only bubble up.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then in order to satisfy new sound requirements, which again in 2010 led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed to meet the needs of all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of dynamics and string attack, and prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the final stage determines the tube character of a power amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, fitted with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behaviour, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
Problems with glass fibre + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fibre optic connection in the house for a couple of weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems setting up a stable Wifi network.
Previously I had a 50 Mbit/s DSL connection and used the Devolo DLan, which has worked perfectly at 50 Mbit/s apart from a couple of outages.
The new fibre optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receives these.
However, at the other end of the DLan module, which transmits the WiFi, the full 500mA is no longer available, but the less I wander around the house with the module, the less current it receives (i.e. use a power outlet that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
As a result, the internet with the new fibre-optic connection is now slower in the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similar large losses.
Could someone explain to me why with glass fibre so much Internet speed is lost over the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay new LAN cables in the house.
I'm really at my wit's end, which is why I've created an extra account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased about an answer.
I'm a very good customer of yours, have already completely furnished two flats with your furniture.
Wanted to find out the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now reliable?
Merci beaucoup
With kind regards
If there is no phone number, a chat, where you have to wait 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I will then give up again soon, because it simply does not work here.
Bonjour
Today, my #PRS_ORG came, but I cannot push it in and thus shorten it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise I would have to send them back as they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a reply.
Is the battery broken?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20 KQ and about 3 years old) stopped charging via my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the battery alone would be enough for operation.
Low battery, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start despite being plugged in.
I then expanded the battery, but again, nothing happened.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in online mode?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
Yes, we both have new and use the version 4.5...
It could even be the case that they have already heard about the problem.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new homes
New Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as has been demanded in a popular vote in Berlin.
“With expropriation, not a single new home will be created; it will only change the owner structure,” said Geywitz in an interview with the “Tagesspiegel” (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the years ahead.
A colourful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is in fact the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and the Left want to set up an expert committee to deal with the result of the popular vote.
But if the situation does not improve, Geywitz is not ruling out talks with the FDP in the red-green coalition about further tightening up of the rental laws.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, restrictions on rent increases in tight housing markets, and an expansion of the rental threshold.
I will speak to the Attorney General to see if this can be done as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not ease up despite that, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not €1,699?
Rat and ideas for further career life
Happy Christmas to you!
My Christmas is a bit meh this year, because my lovely head is just going over everything it can think of.
Before I start to unload here now... in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - i.e. you.
I'm just doing the cross-over as an up-and-comer.
I originally studied something else and worked in a department there (so that I at least won't be too anonymous, I won't mention anything more specific).
But then it all became too boring and I started looking for alternatives that would be more fun for me.
At some point I landed in teaching and I was sure that's what I wanted to do - even though the structural conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I'm now on my third "I Google other job postings."
And it's only been half a year.
In the past I have always decided to keep going and at least finish the ref, after that I can always change my mind.
But right now, I am absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely drained.
Now there are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
In front of the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was also my weekend, my weekend and my party night my party night.
There I was free.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in the moment.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that make me even more nervous.
On the whole, it's fun and from the outside, the Ref looks good, which is feedback and so on.
But I am completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can take before it shuts down - if it hasn't already.
I ask myself whether I want to spend the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some of your contributions - or whether I should not rather go back to the old area, where I was valued, I was allowed to take my free time if I needed it, and the work was boring but paid appropriately and I worked as part of a team and not as a lone fighter, as is now the case most of the time.
But then I ask myself whether I will not have got to the same place in a year's time as I am now and be dissatisfied.
You know, it's all a bit weird, but perhaps outsiders can have advice or ideas of how I can get out of this situation, because I'm completely done and I'm going to start crying at the littlest thought.
I will not be making decisions now, that will probably lead to nothing good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for the time being.
Thank you for reading, and my apologies for the whiny undertone.
I hope that my situation is at least a little clearer now.
Le théoricien du théâtre Günther Rühle est mort à 97 ans
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
He later wrote a monumental theatrical history.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, fresh off the press: "An old man gets older".
The moving diary of a slow farewell to the world written by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading, the news arrives that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I'm already giving thanks for my life here."
Yes, but it was said before.
They cannot deliver from England because of #PRS_ORG.
He has transferred to another company over which he has ranted.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It's been a year.
He has obviously not welded himself to his old spot and has been looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you much back then: oh well.
He didn't even like his job.
There are too many variables.
Help with first own campaign
Boron for the win!
At the moment I'm running a game for a group of four friends, Over the Edge of the World, and I want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign that I've written especially for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, individual episodes plotted and now I'm writing the opening adventure and stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to take a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Thuran lake.
That is where the further action is set to take place.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is said to ambush the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: persuade, act, threaten, detect the danger early on, whatever occurs to the players.
Group size: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords
The goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a hollow way, armed with three left- and right-handed bows, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and subsequently treated by the village schoolmaster, a halfwit.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. If defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf with two of his knights intervenes and comes to the heroes' aid in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything is super.
How appropriate is your Deus ex Machina from solution 2?
Is the encounter too much of an adventure starter?
The Goblins group will later play a decisive role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I had not expected so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely implement many of your ideas and now also have more confidence in my narratives.
You can forget that, I have explained that so many times already yesterday!
This is a glass chest of drawers and all the sides are smashed in, so there's glass everywhere and the cardboard is ruined
The wardrobe is in my home and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come in because of the #PRS_ORG# rules
This means that the wardrobe cannot be removed because nobody is allowed to clean my apartment.
DACH Advent calendar day 6: Family traditions at Christmas time
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we've procured Christmas Day and we're taking that as an excuse to talk about family traditions at Christmas, Advent, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day.
What was that like at home then?
Like with your\*partner\*?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the best for the children?
The Stiefelputzen?
Cookies?
Baumschmücken?
Is music being played?
Is it the Christmas man, the Christ child or is it from grandma and grandpa?
Whatever you do, everyone pretends to be nice and makes an effort to have a nice Christmas as a family.
Whether this is now a fixed tradition, or even every year is something different: tell us how it went in your family or how it will go!
Friedrich wins 60th world cup - Nolte wins two-man bob - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the target of the bob pilot.
I’ve worked it out, I’d have to get nine and a half wins a season, then I might make it to Cortina 2026, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who won two races in two days at the Winterberg events.
First he defended himself against the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths on Saturday, driving from third to first.
Then he changed something in the material settings and drove out on Sunday with a larger lead of 0.30 seconds.
Together with his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Buerger (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he defeated the Briton Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded, said Friedrich, who also extended his winning streak to 22.
Berchtesgaden's Johannes Lochner, who was travelling to Stuttgart, came second this time and reached fifth place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after coming fourth in the first race.
If I knew what he did instead, I would do the same, said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third home victory of the season in the two-woman bob.
After coming fourth in the monobob the day before, she powered to victory on Sunday in the German three-in-a-row with tow rower Deborah Levi to the World Cup victory.
Two-woman bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came second, along with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded her first podium place this winter.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki came third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool to get the first podium place in the world cup, I am super happy that Mariama is coming with me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential there at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt, stressing: "It's not just a case of shoving off, there's a lot to do around the edges as well."
Jamanka was a little annoyed by not quite flawless runs, but she said: "It's going in the right direction."
When it is time to change the current account
Anyone who thought that now there would be calm in the Giro accounts is mistaken.
While many banks used the autumn to confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are also falling.
For example, with a limit of 100,000 euros, the Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous.
Now she has halved the free bet and even quartered it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Postbank subsidiary - to 50,000 euros for current accounts and investment accounts, and 25,000 euros for day-to-day accounts.
However, these lower guarantees now apply to the entire German Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already lowered itself to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at ING Germany.
The DKB bank, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, first to €50,000 and now to €25,000.
After all: According to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have a deductible of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda Bank Berlin also got to 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute running there with the consumer centres, who in the first instance won against this ruling in the Berlin Regional Court.
Now discussions are taking place in the banks as to whether the institutes could possibly set aside reserves - in the event that the upper levels also declare the negative interest rates to be fundamentally unlawful and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

That is really very bad service.

Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finish in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has appealed.
The silver arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest relates to a supposed infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second appeal was lodged against the final classification.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in line with regulations.
On the last lap, Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes and celebrated his first Formula 1 title.
The move came shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken a car ahead of him.

Damper for handball women before quarter final against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slunk off the court with hanging heads and empty gazes after their defeat at the hands of Denmark.
At the end of the World Championship round, the DHB selection team suffered a heavy defeat at 16-32 (8-13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face the hosts Spain in the quarter finals.
We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent, judged national coach Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game by all of us that we need to extinguish," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle for a place in the semi-final, there has to be a clear improvement against the 2019 World Champion on Tuesday, in order to keep the delicate dream of a first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defence, said back player Xenia Smits, and added: We now have to look to the future.
Not up to standard from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on top form at the start.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and holes in the defense were responsible for the quick 0-4 disadvantage after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on business temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a fast counterattack.
The hoped-for initial spark was not this though.
The German women could hardly put up a fight against the aggressive defense of the Danes - and when they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian team.
The game was over at 3-10 after 20 minutes, early in the morning, especially since back player Mia Zschocke later saw a red card because of a hard foul on her opponent.
She is allowed to participate again in the quarter final.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB selection improved and at the break at least came within five goals.
The faint hope of a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9-19.
Once again, the Greens' youngsters sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could not muster another increase in performance and went off the court as a clear loser.
