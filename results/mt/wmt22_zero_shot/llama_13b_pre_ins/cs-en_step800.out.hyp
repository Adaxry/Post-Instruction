The return of the Czech smelter is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech ice hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 33-year-old Plzeň native will be on the bench and could soon get into the goal.
The former goalie of Litvínov, Plzeň or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in the preparation for the NHL in October last year.
Halfway through the game with Vegas, he was replaced and has not played in the NHL since.
The incident occurred in the moment when the experienced goalkeeper moved from one post to another.
Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury, the team from Denver announced at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL net lasted more than two months.
On Sunday morning, American time, he was recalled from the farm, where he had caught four doubles and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he recorded 94.5% of the shots.
A native of Plzeň hockey wants to finally break through and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had problems with his knees in the last season and did not win a single match in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, "Francik" played 36 games, his success rate is 92.3%.
Charles gives Camille a scarf for Christmas, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas wish this year.
His wish was also published by Prince Charles, who used a photograph of his wife Camille helping him put on a coat.
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported the news on its website.
Wishes are sent to friends, colleagues and foundations, with which they cooperate.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color and Princess Charlotte has the same dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, wears shorts and a shirt with a collar just like Princes George and Louis.
Who took the photograph, William and Kate did not say, it is not even clear when it was created.
The royal family posed for a photo, taken as a Christmas wish, in front of a pile of straw at their country estate in Norfolk, England.
The film, which serves as a Christmas wish, was also released by heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured the moment at Ascot in June.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a muffler on his face, helps Camille put on her color-coordinated hat with her light-colored dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbró a million for the title, which Tvrdík denied.
Prague - Criminalists in the current corruption case are reported to have worked on the assumption that the accused former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr was to have been promised a million crowns by Slavia Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The server efotbal.cz reported that it had obtained part of the police files.
Chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club Jaroslav Tvrdík said that the red and whites did not engage in any corrupt conduct.
The server published a transcript of the police interrogation, in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended the summer in the master club, featured mainly.
According to the indictment, the former high-ranking official of the red-white party was in frequent contact with both Berbr and Roman Rogoz, the former sports director of second league Vyšehrad, who is also among the accused.
Police reportedly worked on the assumption that Slavia had promised a financial reward to Berbov for winning the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Prague team won the title in the first league.
The police body was in possession of the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-crown bonus by the officials of SK Slavia Prague, the server quoted from the indictment.
According to criminalists, Berbr later met with Nezmar as well as the chairman of the Slavia board, Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is not clear from the report whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík denied any corrupt conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never tolerated any unlawful action, we have not tried to influence the referees in violation of the rules of fair play and we have not provided anyone with any financial compensation in connection with this," said Tvrdík for Seznam Zprávy.
Among other things, Nezmar unceremoniously offends some former Slavia players in the dark and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The alleged influencing of matches through referees led to a police intervention in the middle of October at several places, including the FAČR headquarters in Prague.
At the top of the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, he was released from custody just like former sports director of Vyšehrad Rogoz.
Helicopters, tanks and BVPs are LARPing the Cold War.
The guns will be new, but essentially of a worse type (the gunners will have to operate from an armoured cabin and load the ammunition manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Tankers and other armoured vehicles - at a decent level, and in addition, it has already been possible to get rid of the Praga V3S in specialised units.
Aircraft: battle-worthy, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and small types without combat potential
Rocket - we do not have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
Honitba is right next to the city.
There were beavers in the river and they were causing damage to crops, so I was sent there.
When I came, I saw a fisherman on the other bank of the river.
I didn't want to make a brothel, so I sat down in peace and minded my own business.
I hoped it would go away before something happened, but of course the fox appeared shortly afterwards.
I let her come within 40 metres before I decided to shoot.
A poor fisherman almost drowned, he was waving his arms on all sides, so I called him and said it was a fox.
Before I fell asleep, I was fucked.
In other words, the man is a Prussian.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a series of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in thermal imaging, which almost everyone has today.
So, in plain sight, take care of things and be at ease.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Vnitro found respirators much cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, which is responsible for purchasing and distributing masks, respirators and face masks for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their purchase in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that the amounts for respirators varied by hundreds of crowns during just one day.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
Why did others buy the train?
Lenka Kabrhelová is talking to the editor of the iRozhlas server Dominika Kubištová.
I value soldiers and armies (I am not affected by memories of the CSLA, which older generations went through), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't have big stocks of technique for them to train in, we don't have any modern technique for the current professionals, in fact, and modern technique is always complicated, so the players' skills will diminish rapidly over time.
Modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can get involved, will be played out very quickly, and there will be no time for anyone to be retrained.
After all, reserves/territorial defence is of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where mass guerrilla warfare is being waged, and this is an express necessity to scare off the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the war can only be waged in a conflict of such scope and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not have a suitable geography for it.
mainly we do not have individual skills.
It is not even the worst.
The worst thing is that half of them play as if they had it.
Then such a situation arises that you look like a fool, whom two minutes later does not hit an empty goal, and you attack alone among two or even three Swiss and you say "shit and what do you think will happen now?"
Needless to say, they won't take him for an average taxpayer.
That situation of making a defender "look like an idiot" is so bad that I found myself genuinely shocked when I saw our attacker manage to beat one of their players.
First swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting any major turnaround in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the pressure on hospitals will hold out for a while longer, and a new, unknown variant, omicron, has been added to the pandemic equation, as we know: a variant that is very likely to spread faster than the currently predominant Delta.
At the same time it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course of the disease, to what extent vaccination or post-infection immunity acquired by previous disease helps.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon has also emerged on the plus side of the Covid equation: the possibility of a cure.
A new drug, antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third, and it is possible to treat it at home.
It will soon be joined by paxlovid, a drug made by Pfizer, which has so far been successful in 85 percent of cases.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming drugs.
As was said, the first to be given molnupiravir to Czech patients will be Merck.
The company was the first to finish the race because the drug had been in development for a long time before the outbreak of the current pandemic, with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for viral infections in horses on the South American continent.
This research often overlooks the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden etc.)
They are generally less open and do not share their opinions.
That is why we Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to speaking "as our beak grew".
You are doing research, asking people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the West, they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racists.
And then they vote for the AfD.
He is afraid of cancelling culture, saying this in public means loss of work and media lynching.
In the surveys, it looks good in the West, bad in the East.
But you find out what people really think.
Only in France Le Pen and Zemmour, both have more than 20% according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in the Czech Republic.
Because of the rotation of units, soldiers do not have to learn where everything is again, so all objects are the same.
One is the Atom Museum Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
Sranda believes that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security reasons or for the speed of deployment of warheads due to its western location.
In those underground shelters (in every tree there are two), only the heads of the missiles were kept, not the entire missiles as it is called.
If it was necessary to use this weapon, a special unit arrived, which took out this head and mounted it on some support.
In addition to the museum's horse chestnut, the rest are in a desolate state.
At the second level of primary school we had a classmate Cigán, we were with him for 4 years.
He was in a good mood, made good jokes, often spoke too loudly, but that was our mascot.
Everyone liked him, he often went for walks and wanted to explain something, he lacked little, he went regularly, he devoted himself to sport with us, he did not steal sweets, nor mobile phones, he went around in clean clothes.
He went to schools in nature, did various monkey business, but he was always in a good mood, maybe never any prankster.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, cigarette smokers entered the same grade, other classes.
Shortly after that, the teacher was beaten up; the police often solved something there, threatened and intimidated other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something on an advert (old things, something I don't need etc.) and I have sold to the Gypsies many times, they always have money, they don't try to get me to lower the price, communication is calm.
Once I even sold a car that way, a boy called me a month later and said he had already picked it up...
I myself say that I am not a racist, it does not matter to me if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they should in polite society (work, function, don't beat women, just normal behaviour).
But when someone comes, shakes hands, takes over flats and houses, creates disorder around himself and causes problems... it doesn't matter what colour it is, but it will bother me.
I don't have a problem with African migrants, if they integrate and start to do business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), and respect our culture.
If you believe in Allah, it's one thing, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be one of them.
Young woman died in a car accident in Prachatice
A young woman suffered severe, multiple injuries and despite resuscitation efforts, sadly succumbed to her injuries at the scene, said Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokesperson for the South Bohemian Health Service.
The accident was probably caused by a driver who took the girl.
An 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot car was probably travelling from the village of Zichovec to the village of Bavorov and for still unknown reasons he drove into oncoming traffic in a bend.
After the collision, the Peugeot car ended up on the roof of the road outside the lane, described the accident spokeswoman for South Bohemian police Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered serious injuries in the accident.
It was a multiple injury and he remained trapped in the car.
After he was released, he had to be provided with acute emergency care and was transported to the Czech Budejovice Hospital by air in a stable condition, the rescuer Fajtlová stated.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor injuries to his chest and was transported to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from countries outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collector's cards.
Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the postal service is often free of charge," the collector explains.
Since October, ordering small consignments has become slightly more expensive, he now has to add VAT and give the data to the customs authorities.
He receives an email saying that the customs officers are expecting the parcel to arrive.
All you need to do is fill in the details of the consignment, and if the DPH did not include the trader in the sale, the customs office calculates the tax from the total amount for the consignment and transport.
If the addressee does not ensure customs clearance himself, the total amount must also include the carrier's fee.
According to Lukáš Neuheisel, however, the entire process is not complicated.
Zakliknu one or two staples, insert two pages and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a question of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all packages are delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs regulations, the daily number of packages received from abroad at the international post office in Prague fell from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech postal service, the problem is also that people do not react to calls for information that is needed to complete customs proceedings.
Currently we have 30,000 items of international mail to process.
If people filled in all the information that is needed, and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says spokesman for the Czech postal service Matyáš Vitík.
Solving inflation
As for the title, how would you suggest dealing with the current inflation?
Currently we have 9.9% inflation and it is expected to grow further.
What do you think should be done to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We can see a reduction in VAT on food and non-alcoholic beverages in Poland, is this the way forward?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it is heading?
Prices are rising faster than wages, according to me it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get (who is an employee)?
This year we added 2% in gross, which is an insult, but fortunately I have a similar income from my business, which I run alongside employment.
Could someone please explain to me why convicted violent offenders are being sent to prison for just six months?
I just can't take my head around how a court can only sentence such an animal to six months behind bars, just to do it again, as soon as it gets out.
Compared to the fact that his/her victim will suffer trauma for several years, negatively affecting their sexual relationships and relationships in general, 6 months is nothing.
And not to mention that the victim of rape does not have to get over it.
Will this discourage potential future reports of rape victims?
Man from Hrob "burnt" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the grave unwittingly helped the guards to secure his nationally sought-after girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was issued an arrest warrant.
He called her himself.
He went around it.
First he accosted a passer-by and invented a story that he had been mugged.
After calling the emergency line, the guards arrived at the scene and could not believe it when the supposed "victim" told them that he had made the whole thing up so that the guards would come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to ask the guards how to report the incident to the Czech police.
When the guards were checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, they found out that the woman was on the list of people being searched for across the country and that an arrest warrant had been issued for her.
The case is being solved by the Czech Republic.
An honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally believe that the Slavs are no longer an ethnic or cultural group, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise I obviously agree with memes, it's a shame Churchill didn't manage to liberate Prague for the US :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefit.
I personally would not consider such a case to be true.
I cannot agree with Pascale here, because there are about 10,000 different religions in the world.
Which god or gods does a person choose?
I would say that it is quite probable that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will not punish you too badly for believing in another god.
However, in the tenth it says that there is no other god but Jahveh.
Therefore, in such a case, it is not more rational to withhold faith in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one from the thousands of gods and having the one true god, which I just happen to be ignoring, send me to hell or some other similar place?
Others: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserves.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
Something like that would suit all components of the AČR.
It would be done in cooperation with the University of Defense.
We can talk about this: There is constant cooperation between the educational sector and industry, companies are fishing in schools, and there is some kind of merging, when workforce is migrating from educational institutions to workplaces.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, every one of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar cross-over should also function between civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way of building some kind of relationship between a citizen and the army, that is, an institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany or even the Mongolian horde will never invade again.
I find it amusing how you see NATO as something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if need be.
No problem.
It only takes one election in the USA to turn their budget upside down and the whole NATO goes down the drain.
The English will exchange us for Russian dirt, the Germans for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they only need to see our backs and they will take what they want.
The only thing that has worked in the long term as a guarantee of independence is an armed force and a population that can control the military technology of their time.
Today, any teenager can pilot a remote-controlled device.
We do not need border fortifications, that is so yesterday, but a teenager addicted to his smartphone will find a way.
How to survive a crab tsunami
Do you unwrap presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly find yourself buried in boxes and fillers?
This "waste" is being used again by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops that accept your used boxes has been created.
Not only about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
That is why it is harmful to treat them as single-use waste.
Anyone can, by agreement, bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper packaging to the connected shop (the KAMsNIM.cz map of the project contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste created and also avoid overfilled blue containers.
Lone traders are welcoming the return of packaging, of which there is currently a shortage on the market, as well as savings, because the cost of packaging cardboard has risen by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, I thereby strengthen my brand.
One such shop is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco drugs and eco cosmetics.
Individuals are delivering cardboard boxes and packaging material to Popůvky u Brna, but we are also hearing from companies with whom we have agreed regular collections of cardboard boxes.
We will use this for packaging shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are creating a more considerate world together.
Our wish is to preserve nature's resources and beauty for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
The www.KAMsNIM.cz application shows not only the collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take away your sorted waste from the household, where to take expired medicines, tyres, used batteries, light sources, bulky waste etc.).
All waste can thus end up in the right place, and reusable items can find their second home.
The map of the project already contains more than 100,000 such places.
Gradually, there are more and more collection yards, re-use centres, containers for textiles, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find a use for things that would otherwise become waste, says Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the association Ukliďme Česko.
Rather, it seems to me that in today's day and age, technology is so simple and intuitive that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but do not learn the basic computer skills.
Recently there has been a problem (especially in English articles) that students at universities do not understand the concept of components on a computer.
Because Google Photos or Apple's photo app or even just mobile phones in general hide the underlying file system with folders and everything is on one screen in the app.
It's fine if they use technology from childhood, but above all, they should learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU before dinner and it was great.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the logo of the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many initiatives that they cannot be implemented in half a year.
French politicians like it and voters like it too.
Macron's supporters on the right and left agree on little, but precisely in Europe.
In France, there will be new presidential elections in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and that France is ready to provide conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators were quick to criticise, saying that Macron was spreading pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In reality, this is an attempt to prevent the rewriting of history.
Far-right candidate for the French presidency Éric Zemmour is currently touring France with the message that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is having quite a bit of success with it with the French.
Let's take Macron's proposal for one history textbook seriously and ignore what is happening in France.
Was it necessary?
Students in European countries learn history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, Frenchmen, and Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know the wider context of the event.
Film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for direction and best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, it was one of the most popular films.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I am not very young, I am not very healthy/fit and I am not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being sick" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea.
(Just personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone has it)

Prosaic texts that follow on from the previous collection Petrček Sellier & Petrček Bellot.
Another portion of observing the world and describing ordinary things with an extraordinary poetic attentiveness, depth and atmosphere.
In his second essay, photographer Šesták attempted to capture the essence of a small town and Czech society.
The story of a return to roots, which turns out to be just an illusion.
The bohemist and comparatist transfers the tale of Red Riding Hood to the setting of a contemporary village.
Its delivery is more brutal than the folk version and it graduates into horror about emotional emptiness.
It is about the fact that the way back to instincts is shorter than man is willing to admit
In his last but one novel, the author tells a less sentimental story of return from emigration than we are used to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make common life possible.
Trains are starting to run according to the new timetable, and in some places the transport provider will change
From Sunday, trains will be running according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where instead of the Czech Railways, RegioJet will begin operating.
Most lines will only have their departure time changed, or their route slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the rails.
With the sale of tickets, the carriers started already in autumn.
Czech Railways plans to operate an average of 6783 passenger trains daily in the new timetable, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections, the rails will also be used for international services to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company is launching dozens of new trains together with the new timetable.
The main novelty will be the InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Another new train will be operated by the carrier in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The carrier will also raise ticket prices by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of services on the R23 Ústí nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín route.
The carrier will replace the Czech Railways after its success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 trains on the track, eight in each direction.
Further changes will affect long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at stations Havlíčkův Brod, Ždár nad Sázavou and Kolín.
Leo Express preserved its 16 trains, two return trains to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to keep the travel times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible even during planned maintenance works.
Without major changes, the operation of trains Arriva and other operators should continue.
The carrier will also change in some regional lines.
Passengers can expect changes, for example, in the region of Česká Lípa, where trains from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk will be replaced by Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn.
Passengers will also be able to use a single ticket for rail travel for a second year.
The price of their tickets will increase by 3.2 percent in line with the rate of inflation, just as with České dráhy.
I must disagree.
Do we learn nothing from the other side?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to hide, how they died.
In my life, I have never heard a lecture from the point of view of the slaveholder or that period, nobody defends that, just condemns it.
Nobody tells you in schools that black people often sold other black people into slavery and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one at school will teach you that colonisers often bought land from the Indians, they will just tell you how brutally we Europeans exterminated them, while killing each other in the process.
I have also spent some time in the US, right at the schools, in the northern schools as well as in the southern ones.
I have not met anyone who would deliberately cover up the facts, but I have heard of it before and to me it is a problem, I do not deny it (for example in Japan war crimes are quite a taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we have a tendency to look at it from today's perspective without understanding.
History doesn't care about people's feelings, it's just how it was and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge it without looking at the thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat it.
Incidentally, when we're talking about those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave owners there are quite popular, but on the other hand, they did have some good successes and it seems absurd to me to want to reject them.
In addition, Sever was not much better, as many people idealize him today.
A lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slave owner and that a lot of things also worked against them.
I wouldn't compare them to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, and on top of that, they don't give a damn about our viewpoint (there was a video on YouTube from TV where someone started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What struck me as ridiculous at US schools was the rise of Marxism and idealization of communism, something that their country never experienced.
All in all, I got the impression that at some universities it was a shock, those students were too radicalized and those schools supported them in that.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, it worries me a little bit that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and in the governing elite as well.
It seems to me that feminism has long achieved what it wanted and it is no longer the same thing.
At present, those who call themselves feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts, and the same goes for other groups such as LGBT, which leads to radicalisation on both sides, where it often leads to resistance even to quite reasonable things.
What is more, the louder someone is, the more radical they are.
In any case, at the end of the day, I have not met anyone who would condemn me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I met with bad geography, but it was mutual:D
Not because I don't like it, but because it is completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Furthermore, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary from the point of view of any personal identity.
If something connects us with people, views of the world and common experiences, it is not where we were born.
I am not a believer, but I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
That Slovak priest is a great guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always throws in some nonsense about the coronavirus, that everyone is ashamed of.
And here, of course, is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they arose from Catholic modernism and are actually Catholics without the Pope.
Know a lot of people who are Catholics but go to services with the Hussites, because it's similar theologically, but members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on the street Botanická.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael at Dominikánské náměstí belongs to the Dominicans and even every Sunday at 15:00 they celebrate mass in Latin, as it was done before Vatican II.
Plamínek from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts brought him from Austria
Břeclav - Plamínek, who was stopped in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts did not go to Vienna for him this time either due to the coronavirus pandemic, and in the morning his Austrian colleagues picked him up at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing.
At the border, they were taken over by the police.
Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year, and we are really looking forward to it.
It is an honour for me to be chosen, said scout Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
While the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, and that was directly at the border bridge, now at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing in the parking lot.
Scouts usually travel to Vienna by train for him.
The distribution of flames across the Czech Republic remains unchanged.
With the Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally travelled by train to Brno, where they were taken over by the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The distribution of the lights will be ensured by scout couriers on Saturday 18 December, who will travel by selected fast trains and personal trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over from them in the stations and spread the word further in the Czech Republic and even where the rails don't reach.
This year scouts must comply with valid measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It is happening in the same way as before.
We advise the courier teams and the organisers of local events to wear face masks of course, to keep their distance, and to try not to sing, just to behave in such a way that it is as safe as possible, said the spokesperson for the Bethlehem Lights campaign Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels around Europe, was born in Austria in 1986.
The aim is to spread the idea of calm, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope for believers, light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, the Boy Scouts have been fighting its spread for more than 30 years.
The action is based on hundreds of volunteers and the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human solidarity.
All actualities, including a list of places where people can come for the light, can be found on the web pages www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economy which would confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as such would be the problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (such as water retention), healthcare and education uses the money appropriately, although I do not understand why the money is being invested in agriculture, industry and generally in companies.
As mentioned, it is producing unnecessary products and crowding out the free market and "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where there are millions of posters on the walls saying "XY funded/co-funded project XY" and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of the company that gives work to x people, this is the rush of development when the company holds on and takes away orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Total agreement, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age will fall into some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that internet adverts don't bother me, but then suddenly I notice that they have an impact on me too – it's just so ingrained that you can't escape it.
For this reason, I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which currently want to ban programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all nonsense, in the words of a classic - I would ban the internet.
Yes, I have the feeling that this virus has roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe something just because most people do and it makes sense, I'm not an idiot, but I'd rather believe something that is less probable, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion about which I will say that it is critical thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television succumbed to the trend of Christmas films, this year there are two hundred premieres
Los Angeles - China, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen out of the trend for Christmas films and this year will premiere a record more than two hundred.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years has been popular with the public and has significantly increased viewership, so these films are being made more and more.
This year, four times more Christmas films were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database includes only those films that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in their title, so the number of Christmas films will be much higher.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated with fairy tales, but globally, films such as Home Alone, Eternal Love or the classic Christmas film Life Is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular.
The real boom in Christmas photos only started in 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark started a special film series, the server BBC recalls.
Her advent calendar project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station started to tease its viewers with Christmas films on October 22 and will broadcast a total of 42 Christmas movies.
Competitor Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies in the pipeline this year, and popular streaming services such as Netflix also contribute to the overall total.
In this magical period of the story, it doesn't matter that much, it's important that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," Brandon Gray, author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies), described the genre with irony.
It's an escape for the audience and a way for them to feel some calm in the middle of all the holiday craziness and insanity of the world we're living in right now, Gray added.
According to him, for example, the television channel Hallmark uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform, but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there's some misunderstanding about half an hour before the end of the movie, which is resolved fortunately and they kiss.
That's just the way it is, and as long as all the films look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people will follow one after the other, Gray says.
Mazepin had a positive text on Covid-19 and will not participate in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will take part in the Formula 1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on Covid-19 and will not participate in the last race of the season.
Team Haas will send only one car to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was attacking for a better position from 20th place, which he qualified for.
Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not take part in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was positively tested for Covid-19.
There will only be nineteen cars on the starting grid, with Mazepin's team mate Mick Schumacher starting from the last place, and Max Verstappen, who will compete with Lewis Hamilton for the title, starting from the first place.
According to the statement of the Haas team, Mazepin is in good order and does not show any signs.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
He is now in isolation and will be governed by the instructions of the relevant health authorities, with safety being the top priority for all parties involved," his representatives told formula1.com.
Haas cannot send a substitute driver to the race.
Any substitute would have to undergo qualification or ride in another part of the weekend.
The first athlete is not affected by Covid-19.
At the start of the season just ending, Covid-19 had Kimi Räikkönen, while Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton were positively tested.
You can also be closed for that.
Everyone will be shocked that the boss said.
According to the law, Covid is on the list of infectious diseases.
So in the same group as HIV, the flu, hepatitis or typhus.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price of the most expensive sword will amaze you!
It is a bit like portable jewellery and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience - at home we never used to wear much make-up, admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours working on his piece over the course of half a year.
He bought the silk in Italy, 24-carat gold thread in France and 2000 decorative crystals from the Swarowski company.
The silver stars were then adorned with 150 diamonds.
The basis is a wave and cotton, but silk adds shine, says the creator of his work, which however does not recommend washing.
And it has one more hook.
I am completely broke, I have to sell my apartment as quickly as possible, Liban admits.

The government approved the sending of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Soldiers, scouts and drone pilots could be deployed before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They will help their Polish colleagues protect the border with Belarus and build the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested help from NATO countries in connection with several months of actions by the Belarusian regime, which has invited citizens from Eastern European countries to its territory with a false promise of an easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiena is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
Currently we have another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from ZŠ Adamov has not been proved," Ciupek said.
Six cases have been reported in the region this week.
We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - this is being done by the National Reference Laboratory for flu and non-flu viruses at the State Health Institute in Prague, the director said.
She added that they were two nurses from one department at the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, and two 11-year-old pupils from the Adamov primary school.
There is no connection between cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, four of them are without symptoms.
No one traveled abroad with suspicion of Omikron
None of the people mentioned travelled abroad, nor anyone from their families, there was no contact with anyone staying abroad.
There is no connection with the water polo championship, said Ciupek.

California restricts gun sales.
It wants to follow the example of Texas and ban abortions.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to ban the sale and production of some weapons in the most populous US state using a legal mechanism that Texas has used in its controversial abortion law.
People would then be entitled to compensation in any lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault weapons and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was in response to Friday's ruling by the US Supreme Court, which upheld a Texas ban on abortions, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established a woman's right to an abortion across the US until around the 24th week of pregnancy.
However, the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
Indeed, the ban was challenged in court by the public at large, thus preventing Texas Republicans from using the regular judicial process to attack it.
I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States, which upheld most of Texas's ban on abortion services and, to a great extent, supported Texas's maneuver to protect its law, said the California governor.
If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, California will use this power to protect human lives, Newsom continues.
He reportedly instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the minister of justice on measures that would allow representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault weapons and so-called spirit weapons.
This is how homemade weapons, which do not have serial numbers and can be used to bypass regulations, are designated.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand at least $10,000 (CZK 220,000) in damages and court fees from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault weapons, parts for "ghost guns" or kits to make them in California.
If the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons off our streets is to create a threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do, said the California governor.
The AP news agency reports that California has for decades banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons, but in June a federal judge here blocked that ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban now using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to proceed with lawsuits against the state of Texas.
Every emergency vaccination has a public testing phase, during which it is gradually determined how the vaccination scheme will look like and the vaccines are also improved based on the results.
For example, there is already a large study from Israel on the effects of four doses.
According to these studies, in the majority of patients, the antibodies increase fivefold, which has the aforementioned long-term effect.
It's just like any other vaccination - it will have its vaccination scheme after a while, just not yet.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus is about to be released on the market, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective.

I think O2 is offering the Champions League, but I don't want to change my television and internet provider.
Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission is acting in violation of the law if it uses the new powers and suspends payments to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan for drawing 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the reconstruction of economies affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move on and use the mechanism enabling the withdrawal of EU funding from countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto in all matters requiring unanimity, said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lack a majority in parliament.
Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which leads to a drastic increase in energy prices, Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will call for Poland to stop its payments to the EU.
It would be unjustifiable in view of the fact that the EU is unlawfully depriving us of resources from the common budget, to which we also contribute, added the Polish minister.
His party's approach to the EU is more radical than that of the ruling party, Justice and Truth.
According to the European Commission, changes made to the Polish judiciary under Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subject it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions, because its goal is not a legal state, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing a "political dictatorship imposed by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of an EU based on partnership between sovereign nations, not one governed by the strongest nations and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never agree to such concessions to Brussels that would undermine Poland's sovereignty.
We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony, he stated.
But to admit it... In Lidl we have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't bump into other things, I met jogurt more often too, I only needed cheese, ham, after ten minutes at the milk counter I resigned and asked.
They did have it, it's true, all the selected, less common and special cheeses were there, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If I have to be evicted, I won't even go to any markets, I won't do this, I won't do that, there's a gold shop in the square, they don't have such a selection, but they usually have everything they need, so in ten minutes I'm done.
So I could take a vacation.
It's all the same to me.
I've been watching for two years how data is handled like manure, most opponents of vaccination are just a bit more off the mark than most supporters of vaccination.
Although a rational discussion is taking place on a professional level, only extreme opinions are being presented to the public.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Ban everything, allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples with pears.
This state has it and we have it.
But no one is dealing with the fact that the method of data collection is different in those two countries.
Fuj, so I'm relieved.
Sorry for the spill and have a nice day everyone.
I was punished as a child.
It was never because of the marks, usually it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (read books instead of going to bed, washed the dishes instead of going to bed, etc.).
At the same time, I have never been punished without a warning, my mother always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get a cut (sometimes after another "screaming" she only brought and put it in front of me so I could see it).
Only after I had repeatedly refused to listen, did I get a few slaps in the face (despite my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in moderation and proportion) is beneficial, because children react much more to it than to words.
I think the part about warning is important because it gives children a choice of whether to listen or not, and if they do, they won't get the spanking.
In the end, I mostly just needed a warning to start listening.
Defense of the system
When prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl responded to a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution means to him – whether the sacred document on which one swears an oath and which one learns about in school from an early age, or on the other hand a treaty that can be changed if necessary – he undoubtedly leaned towards the first interpretation.
Once we agreed in the institute on the democratic rules of our life, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with changes it is better to be more economical.
Imagine: some nations actually like their rules.
So Czechs like dumplings with pork and sauerkraut, said Vojtěch Cepl, glossing the question.
In recent times, however, more and more lawyers are of the opinion that the Czech Constitution needs to be changed.
It is being tested in situations that its creators (among whom Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not predict, such as the behaviour of the directly elected president.
In one thing, however, Cepl was right.
All we know about such documents shows that political interference in their text must be considered.
The institute needs to be understood and actively defended; only then can it be the key to mastering most of the crises that have beset societies throughout history.
The constitution is, among other things, some kind of rule of government made up of individual rules that set limits for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we are tying politicians' hands with bans.
At the same time, however, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to abuse their power.
Covid does not discriminate, in FN Brno they are fighting for the life of a premature baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder in children, there are also severe cases, which are mainly dealt with by hospitals in recent times.
We know that children are less at risk and affected less than adults, we are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults, said Petr Dominik, the head of the Department of Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Brno University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University to Novinky.
The course is much simpler, lighter and often occurs without symptoms.
But they are children who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we are seeing in particular in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, it is dozens of children who need mild support care.
It takes place at a children's infectious disease clinic.
Seriously ill children with the coronavirus have only recently been admitted to the ARU.
Children with post-covid syndromes were on the ward continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
“Now we are seeing an increase in children with acute Covid-19 pneumonia, which is a lung infection requiring admission to an intensive care unit,” he said, adding that the illness is affecting not only adults but also adolescents and even toddlers.
There are also children in critical condition in hospitals due to the coronavirus.
At the moment we have a child of several months as well as an adolescent here, said the head doctor.
He is, however, glad that no child deaths from coronavirus have been recorded at the FN Brno children's hospital so far.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominik, the presence of a psychologist in a children's hospital - not just in the coronavirus department - is an indispensable part of cooperation.
It also draws attention to the fact that, just like in adults, vaccination alleviates the course of the disease and reduces the occurrence of post-covid syndrome in children.
That is why we recommend vaccinations for children as well, the doctor added.
In the calm zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the calm zone is not that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map at mapy.cz.
Generally speaking, you can walk anywhere in national parks outside the quiet zone (but don't climb over the fence into the pasture).
It is not allowed to ski/ride a bike in the forest outside marked trails anywhere unless you have an exemption (but of course this does not apply in national parks).
How does a conductor train?
Music is in my head, laughs Josef Kurfiřt.
He is detached from the Liberec opera and originally played the forest horn.
As a singer, he can sing almost any repertoire, and as a conductor he not only works in the Liberec F. Šaldy Theatre, but also in Plzeň, in the Theatre of J. K. Tyla.
It cooperates with the Hradec Králové Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic, or the Podkrkonoš Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression of being in control of the outbreak and that the authoritarian regime is weathering the crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building an impression of being in control of the virus and that the authoritarian regime is handling the crisis better.
China has launched a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticized for failing to stop the outbreak, which has become a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in the number of infected people.
States including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective gear and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus, for example in the worst-hit Italy.
How to interpret Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
You meet a friend and say to him: do you really not want to ride an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because it mows the lawn, washes the car, and the children play with it.
Not just a parade.
If you want to buy a sloth for 5000,-, let me know.
Kamarád: tak jo plácnem, to bude paráda...
After some time they meet again and the one who bought it complains: you sold the cow for a donkey?
The lawn is trampled, huge crowds everywhere, cars are parked, children fight and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says: you can't talk about an elephant without selling it...
World events are controlled by the great powers.
Despite the equality of sovereign states, it is precisely the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can become such a power only if it works on its integration.
For the time being, it is functioning at the level of economics and politics (in selected questions), but military integration is still missing.
Personally, I think that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It will not take 10, 15 or 20 years.
But in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will work out.
So it occurred to me and it is quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so I might be making up words.
I'm just assuming that an ellipse usually includes two different units at the same level.
I'll borrow an example from another comment, "Spanish oranges and mandarins", where it is clear that they are both from Spain, while with "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is not clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
Furthermore, I base this on the sentence sounding like "all American forces", i.e. including their weapons, and I know that American complexes are operated by Americans only.
To put it another way, I expect that this is already covered by this wide-ranging term and that it does not need to be further specified for US forces.
And again, just for fun:D
Whether it is so or not, it is an unreasonable demand
An earthquake measuring five on the Richter scale was recorded in Tokyo.
Japan's capital Tokyo and the surrounding areas were hit by a magnitude 5.0 earthquake on Sunday.
Witnesses said that buildings shook in the capital, but no damage was reported so far.
No tsunami warning was issued, Reuters reported.
Vicki Holland from Britain tortured monkey Milly
Disturbing footage shows the moment the terrified monkey crouched in the toilet bowl before its heartless owner drenched it in water and laughed at it.
Hollandová also fed the orangutan snacks, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
Gwent magistrates' court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, the Sun newspaper reports.
Experts in primate rehabilitation, who are caring for Milly after her abuse, said they had never seen an animal so frightened.
Milly spent almost two years being rehabilitated by the staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The four-time mother pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Gwent Magistrates' Court she was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison, suspended for one year.
Hollandová was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, given a lifetime ban on keeping animals and must pay court costs of CZK 12,000.
Team leader Steph Sawyer, who rehabilitated the abused animal, said: "Milly is doing well, but her rehabilitation will continue on."
Milly had to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
Opička refused to eat for a long time.
Now that she's settled and content with the male, the sight of new people can still provoke panic.
Psychological scars from the abuse will follow her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse was uncovered after police in Gwent found disturbing footage on the woman's phone after raiding her home over drug allegations.
You can hear Milly using vulgar language in the footage.
In the next video, you can hear Holland offering the monkey cocaine, saying: "Want some cocaine?"
That's nice.
In May, together with her partner Russell Cox (43), she admitted to holding cocaine with the intention of selling it.
Cocaine worth £1,600 was found hidden in Kinder Eggs in her home.
Cox was then jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
What amazing concepts will you learn three times in a row when you bravely jump over the entire 20th century?
Is it the same things you carry in the first grade as in the sixth grade?
The whole thing kills the idea of biffling, when nobody cares if you can do it or understand it.
Mainly write a test for 1 and then no one cares.
Run and ask people at random on the street if they can guess the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients.
Everyone has been through it, and an absolute majority of them don't give a damn and will tell you they couldn't care less.
What is that bitch learning?
I am a big fan of general overview and the fact is that people do not want and do not need it.
At this moment it is useless and you will never get it.
It is partly learned for all those people who will need that thing.
Yeah, but as, I'll make a note that you don't need any of this at the stand by the machine, I was thinking seriously... ...because you just don't need it.
In addition, we are slowly getting to the era when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Which we probably also have to blame on our communist past and grudge against academics and elites) However, the price of having barbarians standing guard over those machines is just too high.
If journalists were able to count, here the Covid would probably never reach such dimensions.
Wedding at first sight: Kadri and Andrey's war continues!
That's the main reason why Switzerland can't leave immediately," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to all the inquisitive fans who wanted to know what had disappointed her so much in Kadir that she had decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
Kadrim and Andreou have been at loggerheads since the start of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move after him, i.e. at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she rejected it resolutely.
As it turns out, their relationship did not end with love, but rather evolved into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! Kadri was outraged by the turn of events after Andreina accused him of lying, gambling and debts.
Kadri's supposed honesty did not please his ex-wife either.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
We normally do not talk about such things at all and we have never talked much about it in the family.
I don't want to provoke any pity.
But when I see someone who is trying to publicly hurt and spit on the name of someone I love so much, I just can't take it!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I want to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for being the character he was and helping our family when we needed it most, even though he was so young.
It makes me even more angry when I have to read such false information, which is probably taken out of context.
I would like everyone to know Kadri as I do, our close friends and family, stand in solidarity with Andrey's words.
I am really grateful for everything!
People will believe what is written, of course, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him and know the truth and know how it really was, added vaguely.
Drunken thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
Don't believe it, for what reason.
His robbery spree started in the parking lot in the residential district, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the available information, he eventually stole around 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he thought of nothing better than to climb up to the fifth floor and to sneak into the apartment through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
One security camera captured him walking away from the scene of the crime and eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he realized the bananas were not where they were supposed to be and called the police.
Ta then detained Cchaa.
The man admitted that he drank something alcoholic on the day in question.
As he needed money, he decided to rob.
The whole thing is being investigated.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to the level of pandemic preparedness.
If this is repealed, the law will not be effective.
Law limits scope of business
Is that reason enough for you?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not eliminated.
Over 60 percent of voters turned out for the Saturday elections to the representative bodies of four municipalities
New representatives were chosen by the people on Saturday in the municipalities of Komňa u Uherského Hradiště, Lužice u Mostu, Nová Ves u Liberece and Rovná u Pelhřimova.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the number stipulated by law or the elected representative bodies collapsed here.
A total of 28 mandates were contested by 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33.
Processing the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a rather demanding, but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils took place in it, and above all the very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said the vice-chairwoman of the CSÚ, Eva Krumpová.
Reminded that due to the Covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personal security.
Saturday's elections in Komňa u Uherského Hradiště were won by the Association of Independent Candidates, which received 27.76 percent of the votes and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means gaining two mandates.
Two seats in the council were won by Občané pro Komňu, who received 18.52 percent of the votes.
Again, the current mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Soukromníků party, was elected to the council.
Independent candidates won one seat in the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná on Pelhřimovsko, the Pro Rovná association won.
It gained 50.5 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 also made it to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
Repeat elections in Lužice na Mostecku were won again by the Association of Lužice and Svinčice, led by mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 percent of the votes and, like in 2018, it has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The second place was won by the Obec pro lid (Village for the people) candidate, who got 43.27 percent of the votes, so the party will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the polls.
Elections in Nová Ves won by independent candidates Hope for Nová Ves ahead of the ANO movement.
For the association of independent candidates, 59.88 percent of voters voted and gained four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened against regular elections in 2018, gained more mandates and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
On Monday the results of the elections will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know very well what people are writing to you here.
You just play the fool to have someone to "fight" with.
If not, it's sad.
I am not saying that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, so that they looked good).
And it's all one to me who believes in what.
On the other hand, I dislike how much power the Church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it amassed, the stifling of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars that have been caused, such as the thirty-year war
TL;DR: Believe in the spaghetti monster if you want, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell headfirst from twelve meters.
Collision with concrete survived.
An incredible fall was survived by a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, when rescue workers from the Moravian-Silesian Health and Rescue Service intervened.
Workers at the regional operational center took over the emergency call at midnight on Saturday with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two ZZS crews immediately set off - a medical one and a healthcare one.
After arriving at the scene, medics discovered that a 27-year-old man had fallen from a window of about 12 metres and landed on his head on the concrete!
Coal was mined in Vítkovice.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went.
In the moment the rescue teams arrived, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct threat to his life.
The attending physician intubated his respiratory tract, ensured artificial lung ventilation and after further emergency care measures transported him to the care of the Ostrava trauma center in an ambulance, said the spokesman for the ZZS MS Kraj, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried about inadequate responses from the public and authorities than the coronavirus
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but in the front line against the infection are primarily doctors and healthcare staff.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We are asking military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a parade of great results.
At the UFC 269 tournament, things were happening.
Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to defeat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had been unbeatable for seven years.
Charles Oliveira showed no mercy in the lightweight division, securing a brilliant submission over Dustin Poirier to defend his belt.
Kai Kara-France also scored a victory, defeating Cody Garbrandt by technical knockout in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
It brought the women's bantamweight bout between the legendary Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the battle as a mental "dwarf", Nunes having not lost for seven years and sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
The beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the path to victory very actively and even delivered a push kick to her opponent, which sent her to the ground.
Penova was not to be rushed into any further mistakes and herself unsuccessfully tried to attack with a backhand.
The second round was breathtaking and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both competitors were characterized by numerous excellent strokes and hard serves.
Penova also knocked Nunes to the ground and started beating her.
Ta had to give up and attack.
The American stunned everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first Poirier did better, but gradually the tide turned.
In the second, Oliveira tried to be more active, and attempted to trip his opponent up.
It didn't work out for him, but then he put himself under huge pressure, got his opponent on the back foot and rained down a series of blows.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but eventually had to tap out.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next fight, Sean O'Malley scored a dominant victory, landing a hard right to Raulian Paiva's body in the first round.
He followed it up with a flurry of precisely aimed blows and notched up a 15th triumph.
Kara-France then beat Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, and now, after seven years, she lost.
Ten hip, or that hip?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, and there is therefore no problem in determining whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
There is also a fairly large group of nouns, the gender of which is not settled.
Such important names oscillate between two genders.
When declining, they take on double endings and in some cases remain uninflected.
For example, the words "svízel" and "kyčel" are masculine and feminine nouns, in the first case declined according to the pattern "stroj" and in the second according to the pattern "píseň".
In another group of nouns, different forms are used in the singular already in the first declension, for example: "row/rows", "beach/beaches" or "potato/potatoes" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are standard, have the same meaning, and are freely interchangeable.
Some words may vary regionally, for example "okurka" in the Czech Republic and "okurek" in Moravia, in this case the Moravian variant is ungrammatical, similarly other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih" etc.
Some words that entered the Czech language from other languages were originally uninflected, but gradually adopted Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is masculine as well as feminine, or the word "buffet", which has remained in the middle gender and has masculine endings according to the pattern "castle".
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation directly on the Greek borders?
Tension reigns on the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people started to move towards the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped protecting them.
European politicians promise Greece support, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.

What is the situation on the ground?
We haven't seen the blue sky for three months and we've been suffocating, a journalist from Sydney describes
Fires that have ravaged Australia for a month have killed almost three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and scorched millions of hectares of land.
How do local authorities and residents cope with the disaster?
Could the Morrison government have done more to prevent the drastic impacts, as critics allege?
And what will the country have to do in the future in connection with climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová is talking to journalist Ika Detrichova from Sydney.
False accusations have always been and are very rare.
Therefore, it is written about everyone everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with how sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to cover it up.
I don't know anyone who was falsely accused.
I know a lot of people who were raped and I've seen how their environment or even the police often treat them.
The victims should always be believed.
The trend is that the victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But not too many people.
And there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It is an insult and a slap in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations are false" and that it is a "trend" you are only helping sexual predators.
The Czech Republic is drowning in unfinished houses, families do not have money to complete them
Construction material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in the last weeks and months.
A number of people got into a tricky situation because of this.
After all, it does not have the resources to finish the family houses that have been started and banks are refusing to increase its mortgage loans.
In addition to the cost of materials, the cost of construction work is also increasing.
People therefore do not have enough money to complete already started family homes.
In many cases, banks are refusing to increase mortgages, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move into half-built and uninspected houses.
In the worst case, the built houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to repay the mortgage and pay the rent," says economist BHS Stepan Krecak.
We are going to build two to three family houses in a year and fifty percent of them will belong to us.
It is hard for us as a construction company that we have to abide by some things in the contract even though the material has become more expensive.
So we're doing it for free," said owner of construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
Many people will only have financial problems.
If they counted on the house being completed for five million, now it will cost seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivoň.
Copper, iron and also installation and heating equipment were the most affected materials.
Construction companies are also struggling with a lack of workers.
In the Czech Republic, there is a lack of graduates in building professions and the influx of foreign workers is hampering the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuing of building permits is positive.
„Construction authorities issued 7,675 construction permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than in the same period last year,“ Křeček specified.
We're doing well and we'll do even better.
True visions are missing, says commentator of the Czech Radio – myRozhlas
Entering the new year is traditionally accompanied not only by classic celebrations, but also by speeches by politicians.
This year, besides the prime minister and ANO chairman Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of the president Miloš Zeman, the speakers also included the chairmen of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
What did we learn that is fundamental?
As a diploma thesis super prestigious, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I'm always doing it for a whole year and then write the written part for a week or two.
State attorneys are completely calm here, unless someone is a total idiot and something remains in his head, then the commission will not waste his time on theory.
I had to learn the ropes for a week and when I was at the end of my tether, the committee always tried to lead me to some logical deduction, which I immediately understood and which was right.
Otherwise those projects, known people who pay someone to do their semester project for them (we've done this a lot, it's really beneficial, you learn a lot), and then they just learn the project and they're done.
According to me, it is great when at the end of the subject there is an exam, which tests the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defence.
But don't send any e-mails and don't call either and don't send any parcels to the embassy.
You will be the same as them.
Those people in the embassy have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can certainly put up a statue of Putin next to the bear.
It would be good to give it to him so that he could slap Xi Jinping in the face or something.
I agree, even though Instagram is kicking artists in the teeth.
Once you're not posting stories and at least new pictures every other day, your achievements will be minimal.
Furthermore, it changes what is more important for the function, whether like, comment or storage.
I've been so stressed out recently that I might have to slow down to a tick-tock, where a lot of artists from my branch have success and I can't allow that.
In the end, I would be glad if something more user-friendly came along, which did not drain all the creativity and energy from artists
Declaration of the Donetsk People's Republic
Svazu – yes, disintegration – no, express their opinion on the picture opponents of the disintegration of the USSR.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in human history occurred.
In the Belovezhskaya Pushcha on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal rights and in violation of the results of the referendum on March 17, 1991, with an openly benevolent attitude towards Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly and without regard for the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
By one stroke of the pen they wiped out a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
The collapse of the Soviet Union left tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens abroad.
The population of Russia has declined by ten to eleven million since the beginning of the 1990s.
Regardless of the loss of non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both world wars together!
Earlier the same people, who in one session in Belovezhskaya Pushcha destroyed what was built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously undertook deindustrialization, halted agriculture, and separated from the fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to delve even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, the war and breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all of these are the results of geopolitical capitulation, the abandonment first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "vacuum of power".
All that was rushed and given up on was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
The whole world is still shaken by events at the end of the eighties and the beginning of the nineties.
The price of the product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover does not necessarily correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 Kč / kg.
I'll buy it with the intention of putting it in the freezer and making it for dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, where I don't buy meat on Monday, the chain reduces it to 99 Kč / kg on Tuesday - explain to me the mechanism by which a change in the price of the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or should I wait until Thursday and the meat will be reduced to 69 Kč / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - what would this meat differ from that which I bought on Monday for 120 Kč and left it in my freezer for 3 days?
I answer myself - nothing.
Those thin-skinned people who think that if something is cheap, it must be bad, shoddy or low quality, are really retarded, to put it mildly;-)
Recently I went to Brno to Hlavas and in the underpass the ladies were handing out some brochure, I always take such things, to help the brigaders, they can't throw it away...
No, the brochure was full of rural common sense and conservative views of the world, but nowhere anything about God, I was puzzled, but I sensed that it would be some kind of agitation.
After reading it, I found out who published it and in the end, Scientology came out of it.
No, as it was a good match, full of completely useless tips, as if I had to wash and not to be pissed.
Waste paper, because of this, forests do not have to be cut down.
Something similar happened to me with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you do things for that person because you like them, without realising just how much power that situation has over you.
A few times she threatened to harm me because I went out with a guy she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment and she begged me not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the doors.
It was a super relationship for about a year, but then another six months passed and it all went downhill.
After that, I ended the relationship by telling her that I was leaving and that I would call her the following week to calm her down and not to worry about anything.
Such a man sucks the city, emotions and overall joy from you.
Rather keep distance
When insurance companies compete in buying up the cloud of tests and hunting down the positive, who would know about that horrible disease.
The only thing we can achieve is complications for companies, drivers and others, due to the fact that their employees have spent five days in custody.
In the West, they have already stopped vaccinating against hepatitis B, and have recognised that it is not worth solving diseases weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is a newcomer and has to earn his spurs and pump up his ego with some bullshit.
I am delighted that the old good one is returning to us.
After several years of decline and suppression of this nefarious business, MLM recruitment is returning to the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20, a first-year student at university), the initial vows about training products and commercial skills were soon replaced by "you don't have to be interested in that, especially if it's just going to piss people off".
I was honestly interested in the products I was selling because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and manipulate people.
When the first paycheck arrived, a person quickly realized that if they wanted to earn, they had to launch a few certain products monthly.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only sources of income, so people felt like street vendors.
What can I say, the experience was valuable, people learned that you can't jump to any conclusions and that you have to thoroughly check the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't put all my eggs in one basket.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly will not brag about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I haven't done so many things in the corporation where I work.
HR is calm, managers are looking at their management and power does not bother us at all.
Regular evaluation then takes place in some form, which is how it happens with us too (set yourself some goals for the next year, and then check back after a year's passed) - it's rather a form of self-evaluation than someone evaluating you based on some numbers, and so on.
Company action is also voluntary.
But we are a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you have the feeling that we are such a startup that is squatting in the offices of a big corporation.
But it doesn't bother us much, as long as the results are good.
Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
British police have been searching for a 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November for almost ten days without success.
On Sunday 12 December the Minister of Foreign Affairs in demission Jakub Kulhánek announced on the social networks that the woman from Uherský Brod was found dead.
British police confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not provide more information about the case.
Sincere condolences, tweeted Kulhánek.
The last time the young woman was seen was on November 28 in a bus on her way home from work when she stopped to withdraw money from a cash machine.
Her disappearance was announced by her colleagues five days later.
Afterwards, the London police started searching for her, and Interpol included her on the list of missing people all over the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police have already detained one man in connection with the incident a few days ago.
What role he played in the case and what he suspected, but did not disclose.
In four municipalities, new councils were elected at the end of the year
On Saturday 11 December, in the municipalities of Komňa u Uherského Hradiště, Lužice u Mostu, Nová Ves u Liberece and Rovná u Pelhřimova, new councils were elected.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the number stipulated by law or the elected representative bodies collapsed here.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates competed for 28 seats.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters cast their ballots.
The mandate was won by a total of 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33.
A total of 13 candidate lists have been registered for the new elections to the representative bodies in the four municipalities.
36 women and 63 men competed for 28 seats.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72.
Processing the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a rather demanding, but successful year.
Four new or repeated elections to local councils and, above all, the very closely watched parliamentary elections took place in it.
We had to work in more demanding epidemiological conditions, which imposed greater demands on equipment and staffing, said Eva Krumpová, 1st deputy chairman of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49.
On Monday the results of the voting will be debated by the State Electoral Commission and, following approval, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
Dealing with the fact that we had a downright dangerous infectious disease here at the beginning took some time, but it went without any major incidents.
Keeping up with how idiotically a large part of the population behaves on all levels is a problem for me so far.
I am most looking forward to getting vaccinated (tomorrow!) because it will finally mean I am no longer dependent on others not being idiots.
He was deprived of the presidency and the ability to regain it.
The chance that this will actually happen is, however, as others have mentioned, very small.
Furthermore, I am not sure whether the recording of the survey could be considered treason at all.
Velezrada is such an act, which threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 without sex for the whole year is growing
The more and more young adults in the USA are living their lives without sex.
They are mainly religious people, the Daily Mail website states.
The survey showed that the share of people younger than 35 who abstain from sex has risen from eight to 21 percent since 2008.
Women aged between 18 and 35 who said they had not had sex in the last year is more than ever before.
The decline in the number of sexually active individuals is also contributed by other factors, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them could be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex a smaller and smaller priority for young people, could also have contributed.
Since 2010, the share of men and women aged 18 to 35 who say they didn't have sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly, according to IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Among people in marriage, sexual activity is more frequent and only 5% of them stated that they were without sex for the last year in 2021.
It was at 29% among the general population. Stone added that marriage before the age of 35 was a small percentage.
Loss of sexual activity is also contributed by fear of premarital sex and religious foundations.
Despite the fact that married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and unattached people under 35 is still falling.
Young people's views on premarital sex are divided, about 30% think it is a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
It's true that in this age group, single people are in the minority, but their behaviour is pushing this trend,' Stone says of the 30 per cent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital sex, the reason is religious foundations.
Since 2008, the proportion of abstinence has increased from 20 to almost 60% among young people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month.
Among "less believers," the trend rose from 10 to 20 percent," Stone declared.
Other factors contributing to the decline in sexual activity include less social interaction and, mainly, social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is lower among people without work, or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, thereby "replacing" this need.
This trend has mainly persisted during the lockdown during the pandemic.
The entire vaccination campaign against Covid is about whether the company should force a part of the population to behave in a way they do not want, but which could save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, and the one I am most interested in is the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether, if we don't stop them, and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could all be held responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know what was going on, we didn't explain it to him very well, he heard some disinformation, and as a result he couldn't be vaccinated and then he caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can blame the death of a stubborn opponent of vaccination, who together with the SPD and the KSČ is pushing something about bullying and totalitarian state.
Based on the statistics I mentioned, it is possible to clearly conclude that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners belong to the second group, so they will actually be able to get it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
So far this winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent years.
Operators of ski resorts cannot do without technical snow, and the weather is complicating the preparations for the cross-country skiing Jizerská 50.
Is it a trend or an exception?
What will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one joke, but it's not about a waiter.
Once our teacher took us to the middle of the city to the shipyard so we could go on a boat trip on the river.
On the way there we went down one quite wide street, and we didn't see anyone - Hare Krishna followers.
Of course, we were hit.
Fortunately, I managed to escape, but I got into conversation with one friend.
When she left, we asked her and the teacher what she had said.
It asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I have no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, were laughing all the way to the shipyard.
We are terribly confused.
It's not that bad, but the system is already crumbling, says Orozovič
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honours.
We are opening a new chapter in bilateral relations, said Morawiecki at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must make it clear that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by disturbing movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border can be solved by using diplomatic negotiations, even within the “Normandy format”, bringing together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that the Chancellor was informed about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko has artificially created a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because every night we record hundreds of attempts to (illegal) cross the border.
The Chancellor was talking to me about further sanctions to bring home to Mr Lukašenko's regime and his patrons in the Kremlin that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz, according to the DPA agency, assured that Warsaw is enjoying German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of the Lukashenko regime with refugees.
Drunken Polish nun caused accident, tried to cover it up
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but it was being driven by another nun who was trying to blame herself.
When the police told her that she could also lose her driver's license for not giving way while driving and not stopping at the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
Admitted that she ran into another nun who asked her for help.
Police then came for sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breath test and when they discovered she had more than twice the permitted level of alcohol in her blood they immediately confiscated her driving licence.
At the same time, they announced that they would answer for their deeds in court.
Pes Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič, however, did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies watched American stories about dog lovers.
But they forgot one thing in the process: the laws of filmmaking.
After the heartwarming film F. Brabce Gump - a dog who taught people to live, another film is now competing for audience emotions in cinemas Tady hlídáme my.
Co-author of the screenplay and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič ml. loosely continues his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
The speaking gorilla Hugo returns to the scene, along with some well-known characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, owners of a dilapidated mountain hostel, which is about to be repossessed, and to whom peasants begin to flock for help. Julie's father and his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a young woman going through her first love.
The director and his partner, Beatriz Shajmovičová, who is also the producer of the film, struggled with the storytelling in the previous dog movie, but at least the children and the dog were amused.
This time the creative duo has written a weaker screenplay, which evokes a mixture of admiration and embarrassment.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, a scientist though she is, in her yearning for a child falls prey to the wiles of the devil and if the "constellation" is right, she has sex with her forestry engineer, Ivan, wherever the coordinates happen to be pointing – on the car bonnet or the church tower (needless to say during an excursion with a local guide), retired colonel Mojmír, despite long training, shoots his own daughter (Julia), who falls into a coma, and is then taken away to hospital by the family, so that in the heart of the Šumava wilderness the miraculous process of recovery can take place with the dog.
Nothing against natural healing and the strength of animal milk.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer gasps at how much content, full of unbelievable situations and characters, was needed for this message.
The duo of thieves from the staff, the competition of dumpling makers, the Šumava charlatan, policemen arriving to search for "drugs" and discussing herbs of the fertilising power of bone meal – and which roasted family in the pension will of course get drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and then sits, made-up and smoking, at the family table demanding her father's whiskey and flapjacks as a cured vegetarian, you can't help but cringe.
The creators also explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma".
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build up pivotal situations, a feeling for characters and the point, and directorial guidance.
Actor performances are uneven, editing is lifeless and the overall impression is underwhelming.
Whatever Lukáš Vaculík, JitkaJežková or Nela Boudová try to do with their parties, they have little to play with.
The only redeeming feature of the film are the poetic shots of the Šumava countryside by cameraman Vladimír Holomka and the pair of jezebels.
It is not enough to sketch a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog barks, let alone vulgar expressions used by the characters.
Neither is long-standing membership of the Club of Jezebel breeders - as in the case of the producer lady.
If you want to promote nature and the bond between man and dog, you need to have knowledge of the trade, because you want to tell a credible story.
It did not work in this case.
There's a bit too much erotica and a minimum of wit for the genre.
Neither as an advertisement for canisterapia would this amateurish piece have passed.
Yes, respect, because you have to listen to constant insults from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, and you can see I understand that, because you have never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want an answer, the answer will always be no.
If you were such a kid and listened to the furt, you might change your mind.
It is work like any other, in this case a brigade of workers.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only period in the year when it rains.
Almost complete absence of rainfall during November, which we recorded at some stations, is unusual, the Israel Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term average rainfall for November.
The two-day rain this week was therefore an exception.
It is good for us.
It hasn't rained for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas decoration, said the inhabitants of Nazareth Wasim Ashkar.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, is impactful and irregular.
Winter rains are dependent on forests.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not just about forests, but also about water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, has been filled to the brim this spring due to three rainy winters in a row.
Since then, the level has fallen.
Water managers have been warning of drought for a long time.
It is to be expected that, depending on global warming and changes in climate, there will be a decline in rainfall here, predicted Uri Schor, spokesman for the Israeli Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel is capable of using technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Such economically weak countries as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the Jordanian capital, Amman, more tankers are appearing.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
This year, my orders have risen by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years, Imád Sulejman, a tanker driver, announced in September.
In Iranian Isfahan, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river was completely dry.
The region has the driest November in many years behind it.
Israel prepares military action against Iran
Israeli Minister of Defense declared that negotiations in Vienna did not bring “any progress” and informed Washington about preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
On Saturday, Minister Benny Gantz declared that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military strike against Iran, informs Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who lives in the US, is trying to persuade Americans to step up pressure on Iran, but also informed Washington about military preparations.
Speaking at a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had produced "no progress at all" and that world powers "realize that the Iranians are playing them along."
It happened to me about 3 years ago.
I flirted a bit and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wanted.
In the end, I discovered that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these kinds of cheesy pick-up lines, I hesitated for a second and then thanked her and left.
Sure, tell me I'm an idiot, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers went to the mountains for the weekend, there was enough snow and beautiful weather waiting for them
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first big rush of skiers this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no lack of snow and some ski areas have started operating.
Drivers were not deterred by the obligation to prove themselves with a COVID certificate at the wheel.
While trailer owners are not complaining about lack of interest from customers, some ski equipment rental companies are reporting weaker demand for their services than before the pandemic.
Thousands of people went running and skiing in the Liberec Region over the weekend.
The skiers were pleased with the weather, which offered sunshine as well as excellent snow conditions.
We are satisfied that the opening weekend really kicked off with the evening skiing on Friday, when we had the first skiers on the hill, praised the director of the Sport Areal Ještěd Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people also went to the Jeseník Mountains for the first skiing weekend of the new season.
For example, the Ski Aréna Karlov or the centre in Branná u Šumperka were opened.
The weekend attendance was very decent, with an estimated 400 people arriving on Saturday and today.
The conditions are suitable.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, no praise is too high for the representative of the ski centre in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who have been vaccinated or are within the incubation period for Covid-19.
People are ready for it and prove the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn information centre told the ČTK.
We only recorded individual incidents, he added.
Less interest than before the pandemic is being reported by some rental and retail outlets of ski equipment.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in previous years, but there are enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
Greater demand is expected in the period of ski courses.
The managing director of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, David Šinták, also feels that there is less interest in renting ski equipment due to Covid.
At that time before the pandemic, we were almost bankrupt.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are around 50 percent, said ČTK Šinták.
According to him, people got used to the pandemic and learned to stay at home.
On the other hand, the car rental in the Novako Božím Dar area is recording a big demand.
Rental of skis started there a week ago and interested parties must now book them in advance.
We are renting out the skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we are expecting a lot of interest, just like last year, said the operator of the area Pavlína Nováková.
According to her, the interest is comparable to the period before the epidemic for ski schools.
If we want successful and wealthy people to stay here, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life like abroad.
Certainly not socialist healthcare, where it is often difficult to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Many clever and skilled people are leaving the country, as they have no property here.
The owner of the company will not go abroad just like that.
I completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then these people will simply not live in the Czech Republic.
The exodus from Hungary started with Orbán winning on a beautiful day, ruling for a year and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a couple of hundred thousand.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
Another question is the elections themselves.
If you live here, you might as well vote for some traditional V4 madman.
The young and educated will leave, while his supporters and people whose assets cannot be squeezed into the aircraft will remain.
Breathtaking photo!
Langmajer in blood due to betting on beer?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the film crew, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor then posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a description due to filming?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech.
She was last seen on her way home.
The disappearance of Petra "bears no resemblance to her behavior and we are getting very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor, from Lambeth police station where Petra worked, said in a video released on Saturday.
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is, she continued.
The missing Czech woman, according to her, left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28, and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last seen in a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on December 3.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "healthcare assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.
We have enormous fears for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing, said the group of healthcare facilities in a twitter post.
We want to appeal to anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police,' the statement continued.
The public is calling for cooperation, too, as is MP Harriet Harman, who drew attention to the case of Srnicek at a press conference on Saturday.
It's been several days without a trace of her, she's only 32, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are naturally devastated," the Labour politician said, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
I feel that we all have a particular responsibility to try and find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our health service, Harmanová said.
Police have already arrested one man in connection with the case and he remains in custody.
According to the BBC's news website, however, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what he was suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I do not underestimate Ukraine either.
They are not "enormous numbers", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
You notice that Ukraine constantly repeats that the threat of invasion is exaggerated and that our entry has teeth.
I quoted above.
I don't know why Russia wants a war.
War is very expensive and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Compared to the situation in 38, it is in so many ways that I do not even know where to start.
I can already compare it to the first Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily:D
I can't imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex those funny republics.
That's it and this "concentration" at the borders would correspond to that.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
In Prague, new timetables have been in force since Sunday, affecting mainly suburban services
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport (PID) can expect a few changes from Sunday, which will mainly affect suburban services.
New lines were created, some changed their routes, and others disappeared altogether.
Mladoboleslavsko is being newly integrated into the system.
From Sunday, fast trains from České Budějovice will stop at the Zahradní Město station in the capital city.
In suburban rail transport, trains S7 run, which on the route from Beroun to České Budějovice travel through Prague main station.
In the recently opened station of Prague-Zahradní Město, the fast train R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov will be stopping for the first time.
PID is expanding into new areas.
Buses will also go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses will be introduced to Mladoboleslavsko, including lines that cross over into the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
When integrating, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced, and operations on 12 existing lines will be modified.
A new bus line 405 is being launched from Zličín in Prague, which will go as far as Žatec.
A new direct link has also been created between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
It will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at weekends, when a new express service number 404 will be launched.
Newly included in the PID system are lines 400 and 410 travelling to the Liberec region.
They depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nádraží Holešovice station.
The main line 400 runs through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected services continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The supplementary line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimoň and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the other hand, the operation of dozens of local tracks in the middle of the country has been curtailed, including those to Mochov, Dobříš and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains with departure from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines from Prague to Beroun, Prague to Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín.
Passengers can also expect changes at other locations.
Buses replace some of the cancelled railway lines or extend the section on line 420 from Dobříš with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets as far as Milevsko.
Changes were made to bus routes 540 to 543 in Nymburk and some bus routes on the border between Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Plzeň Region.
Healthy snack/lunch from the supermarket to the office
Hello, I do 9-5 with an hour for lunch and my only option to get a meal is to go to Billy or a bit further to Lidl.
Since I don't have any movement, I don't have the strength to train after work, so I have to eat as healthily and dietarily as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy a maximum of pizza and for dessert yogurt and apple.
Question: What healthy food would you recommend I buy in the supermarket without having to heat it up?
Not everyone is waiting for a metre of snow like you, unfortunately.
It is not about trees that you must necessarily see.
Under the snow, only the tip of the tree can be hidden.
If it is damaged, the tree may be more prone to fungal disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason we're not allowed to ride off-road, but it's one of them.
Darya's confession about her relationship with Nedved: I did not enjoy it at all
The Czech showbiz pond has been living for nothing but revealing the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd since Thursday.
They have been together since the summer, and the famous footballer even divorced his wife for the singer.
Dara has now sent a lengthy message to fans, explaining why she kept her pregnancy a secret for so long.
I am willing to say that currently there is no-one in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia whom it would not have been noticed that Dara caught a bear, sorry, Nedvěd, jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer up to his ears.
But he didn't rape her, on the contrary.
Three days are the focus of attention, and though they are used to public interest, they do not enjoy the attention.
And here it is.
What we were both not looking forward to, but we knew it would happen at some point, the singer continues.
I just don't know who is worse off.
If it doesn't interest you at all and you don't give a damn, or if it's us whose lives are being scrutinised in detail.
As if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you get on with your husband or boyfriend, or whether you insisted that everyone really did need to know a list of all your exes and be apprised of a catalogue of your errors and misdemeanours.
It's true, it's what you want, it's bad for the country.
The couple met in Italy, where Rolins was preparing her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been working as the vice president of the Juventus football club for a long time.
The truth came out only now, because they waited for the end of Nedvěd's divorce.
The couple have been separated for three years, but have only been divorced for three weeks.
To those who are happy with us and wish us well, we thank you.
We are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
So I love my new man and I'm standing by him just like he's standing by me, in the good and the bad, Rolins concluded.
Hi, other commenters have probably already said everything important, so I just confirm that the halls are great at the beginning, my classmates mostly got to know each other and became friends during the first semester and found accommodation together, which is the best option for me, because you know who you will be living with.
Most of the time, flats are not advertised for a long time in advance, so now you probably won't find anything, but looking at the offer certainly won't do any harm.
Otherwise, it is certainly not only Cejlu, but also the surrounding area (streets such as Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that is a bad address), and also some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří quarter is very student-y, Královo Pole and that direction is fine, besides, it is close to the majority of VUT faculties (I don't know where exactly you are heading to).
I have never rented an apartment, but I am a native of Brno, so I can possibly advise you on Brno as such, if you need any further information.
That is an example of completely "normal" thinking for me.
Because of what a few doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is completely in order that the state does not sufficiently finance some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it themselves, or they go according to the state and pay for it themselves.
Nevertheless, we cannot allow a private actor to take over a piece of education just because a few crowns happen to fall into the state's contribution.
Such claims carry somewhat less weight when made by a person who two days earlier spoke about the petition campaign for a boycott of a totalitarian state in the following terms:
So a vote against abortion is the same as a vote against a statue being placed in a square?
If I were you, I would consult with the person who hired you directly.
In any case, I have already experienced during cataloguing/digitisation that (and even long-term professionals) that it is either somehow suitable from the eye, or they will write something on the lines of xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and add a note that it is unreadable.
It is true that in this case it is quite readable, so I would not recommend it at all.
Personally, I would deal with it in a note somewhere, according to which program you use.
If you want to be a good and diligent student, you can look up some sign language databases and find the nearest.
But because it looks like you're drawing from some book, I'd hazard a guess that the author or the mint just created their own symbol and slapped it on the coin.
PS: Is it not more of a coincidence that the Odra region (kingdom) is more often referred to as Oderland?
PSS: Someone has already spoiled it for you.

Politicians do not know what will be the "topic" of our presidency.
That is much worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that something was approved because nobody understood some text is funny.
All important approved documents are being examined word by word, and a basic knowledge of English is not enough, that is the job of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various institutions of the EU and English is more suitable for informal contacts and establishing above-standard relationships with politicians.
What is more, it is quite interesting with the English after Great Britain's withdrawal from the EU.
I don't hate Czechs.
I have been working there for the third year and I am completely at ease.
How often do you commute from work I commute at 10 p.m. and never have any problems.
That it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who hardly ever goes there.
Yeah, most of the Romany population of Brno lives there, but the only thing they do is obstruct the pavement and park where they shouldn't :D I certainly wouldn't be scared to walk down the street there in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively low-cost accommodation with good access to the centre, I'd be happy to go there.
There are now full houses in the newly reconstructed or newly built buildings.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dad and girlfriend Gelemová as a stake in the ground!
With whom will you spend Christmas?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the advent wreath, but not Felix Slováček.
I don't have an advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw dad's wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada remained alone after his departure.
Slováček still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently we met with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: AGAIN TOGETHER!
But we talked about something, so it didn't happen on Christmas.
I really don't know where I will be.
I am buying presents gradually and I am certainly going to buy something for Dad and Lucia, maybe perfume.
I am a gentleman, Felix added, who came to the christening of the musical video clip to the club Richman.
I am here alone, but I do not feel alone.
I always find someone to have fun with, says Slováček, who was glad to have met the wife of Luděk Sobota, Adrian, or singer Kamila Nývltová.
He made it clear.
And we are an island, aren't we, so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will stand up for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
I don't understand why it should be a bad argument, can you explain it to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be used in a crisis in hospitals.
There are too few police officers and they cannot afford it, so the firefighters and no one else has such a high percentage of health and safety trained people at such a level.
After all, our army is capable of defending Ostrava against all previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for too long.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside should not only be a factory for food, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has disappeared from mountainous and foothill areas, and even places where there has never been a lack of water are recording a smaller amount of rainfall.
The cause of the drought, which is affecting much of Central Europe, is climate change.
The impact is also intensified by the way we treat the soil.
What to prepare for a dry spell?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
It will be like that, as long as I stay on my skates on the ice, I know how to play hockey and that tactics (which I've tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is generally all talk.
Whether it is the "polar bear Russia" or the "lama China" hockey team, losing by two goals is another thing than when the game is tied.
Well, as it is, I'm listening to Czech commentators who are pointing out what the referees aren't seeing, whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's how it is with all sports, UEFA and the "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
In my opinion, if it was the other way around, it would be as always, and that the Czech Republic has more often lost to Russia than won, it would be a classic "they lost" vs "WE WON".
Coronavirus: Number of cases in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily cases.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of cases in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new cases have been registered.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered cases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" big wave of infections caused by Omikron, Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser to the British Health and Safety Executive, said on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with the omicron variant are already being hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins is expecting the number to grow.
So far no one has died of omikron, but people are being hospitalized about 14 days after infection and dying about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz at Downing Street in December, when the lockdown was in place and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister in Johnson's government defended the quiz, saying it took place "virtually" via computer.
However, Downing Street was attended by groups of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure is growing to remove Johnson from the premiership.
During the last December in London, when a strict lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers organized numerous events despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government are making fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor commercial television ITV for Britain: Two years ago, Boris Johnson won a decisive majority in the general election.
Today, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him from the post of prime minister.
It is remarkable how quickly events developed.
Do you want to turn and save your skin?
Hungary awaits elections in the spring, which could end the 12-year rule of Viktor Orbán.
They will be elections of European significance.
How much can we wait for them to be fair?
They will not be friendly.
They will probably not be free either, because the last two elections under Orbán were not free either.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes electoral districts to benefit from that, and does other small or big tricks.
So far, the last one says that everyone can choose where they want in practice.
To enable Fidesz to lure voters from districts where the outcome is certain to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could win.
So I'll just say that they won't be at all.
Do you think it will be the same as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
It used to be whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by the united opposition.
It is a great exception for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Will they try to hold on to power even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are prepared to go beyond what they did so far.
Recently a recording of the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz László Kövér has been leaked to independent media, where he explains to the heads of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
What are these signs of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that is one of the innovations.
Everything starts with the language.
I was bitten quite often, the last time at 14, my mother cannot be patient, nor can I, my father has had it for a long time, but then he snaps (just in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I was very angry as a little girl, to the extent that I lay on the ground in cramps and was completely blue, they took me under the shower twice to calm me down.
Sometimes I was educated, sometimes it was more that they didn't know.
Definitely, I now have a tendency to solve things violently, as a child I was quite a handful, now I just scream and shout to get my own way, and as a child I had to have my parents wrapped around my little finger (so I didn't get too much power), so I've never done anything extreme, but I've always had that urge.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is my explosiveness, but certainly education also has its share.
I am afraid that I will also lose patience with the children and solve it the same way.
I think that beating children is simply wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially at a time when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent just does something to their children, so I cannot really blame them.
It does not bother me at all, I do not understand why OP should be ashamed of something.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.

Kočner's crazy world.
Where is Slovakia moving the process with the murder of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial in the case of the killing of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It stirred up civil society, but also exposed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marian Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How fundamental will the process be for Slovakia?
Journalists can thank their lucky stars for this one.

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of a repository nowhere
Minister Karl Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is coming to an end, and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens were taken into account when selecting and permitting a high-level radioactive waste repository does not exist.
The government's legislative council has suspended debate on a proposal submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after lengthy delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities united in the Platform Against Deep Storage, but also with the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Municipalities are expecting a significant strengthening of their possibilities for decision-making on the storage site, which has been promised to them since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is demanded by the Czech atomic law and the European directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with municipalities.
The bill put forward by Minister of the Environment Karla Havlíčková, which is available to the Platform, has been criticised by municipalities primarily for the following reasons: The level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the location for the deposit is inadequate and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can be truly effective only if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will take place at all in a given location.
It is possible to ensure this by obliging the storage manager to obtain the consent of the affected municipalities before starting the specific proceedings.
The proposed amendment to the statement of intent virtually ignores the involvement of the public and makes citizens into mere statistics in the granting of permits.
The proposal lacks a systemic setting of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a location for storage, its permitting and operation.
According to today's legal norms, representatives of municipalities do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a place to store waste.
Only in some regulatory proceedings may submit their remarks or appeal, but the authority or minister, in whose interest it is to issue the permit, decides.
The case has no effect on the carrying out of exploratory or construction works.
Co-decision making by self-government, which the Platform is asking for, is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries and certainly in those that have gone further in permitting deposits, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the bill is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is about a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s. r. o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and based on contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total sum for these works is almost 4 million crowns according to the register of contracts.
Antonín Seknička, mayor of the village of Cejle from the locality of Hrádek and a spokesperson for the Platform against a deep geological repository said: After the ministers of industry, who merely passed the responsibility for seeking a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste on to their successors, we expect a significant change of direction from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We are also grateful to the Association of Towns and Municipalities, which views the problem of inadequate rights of municipalities for such a fundamental building in the same way as the directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The Platform Against Deep Geological Repository unites 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to push for a change in the state's approach to dealing with burnt-up nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to a deep geological repository.
Furthermore, the platform advocates that the decision on the location for potential storage should be conditional on the prior agreement of the affected municipalities.
John Goodman (69) was forced to give up his fear of gaining weight: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for years, doctors eventually scared him.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
It was taken.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, the newspaper The Sun reports.
He introduced his new character at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles.
The man from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family had begged him to lose weight because his big body was breaking the furniture.
I swallowed everything, the actor said in an interview with AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Run, exercise.
I'm getting to the age where I can't afford to sit down, Goodman, whose transformation is amazing, told ABC.
So it depends on the boss and in what you want to use the word "boss".
If it is some text on a platform that is expecting readers from the gaming environment, I would not translate it at all.
If it was about a text that was formal and academic, I would try to describe or explain it.
After all, there are more types of bosses.
Games like Dark Souls have several bosses, and then there's the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), which are not necessary to defeat at all in order to complete the game or level, but are often much stronger than standard bosses.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are there, but the player does not encounter them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), so how can they be named at all?
No, and then there are mini bosses.
It is simply impossible to translate the boss's single-word exclamation of "wow" into Czech or any other language ( Catalan is interesting in that it translates the boss as the final opponent).
It's basically important for the story or the game in general, computer-controlled, stronger than all previous opponents and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police are also involved.
British police have been searching for missing Petra Shrncová since December 3.
The search was joined by the Czech police.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherský Brod has been missing since December 7.
Through Interpol, it also helps the British police.
Czech Petra Srnkova was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular because of her.
After Peter, the world is looking for him.
The Czech police is closely cooperating with the British police, police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
We share information on the case, she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimetres tall, plump and has brown eyes and long, straight hair of the same colour.
It should come from Uherský Brod.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her
The search for Peter was joined by local MP Harriet Harman.
She took part in putting up posters with Petra's face on them.
We have huge concerns about her, she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
But it is not clear who is being referred to and what they had in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While data in October showed a slight decline in offensive campaigns, attacks intensified last month as the end of the year approached.
We recorded a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the e-mail should alert the user to the name, which refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word "invoice" in its name, this time it was called "Copy of account statement for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains functions that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The harmful code actively searches for stored login data and then sends it to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of attackers is growing again.
In November, the spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not targeting the Czech Republic specifically and security experts captured campaigns with a global reach in November.
Compared to the November data of the Formbook, it slightly weakened in November, but it still accounts for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook usually contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
The name of the account, however, continues to appear.
The attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for a Czech user.
Significant decline and weakening of activity is evidenced by security analysts in the Fareit programme, which was behind 1.6 per cent of attacks and in the Czech Republic has had no major offensive campaign in recent months.
Today's demo of clever people who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The procession in Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the shots from the procession along the embankment and according to my experience of a demonstrator, I estimate that around 10 thousand people took part in the demonstration.
People in the procession filled the quay and the bridge and the opposite quay.
It means that people really care.
A spontaneous crowd of several thousand demonstrators is joined by an unprecedented number of onlookers.
I am saying that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That lasting dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led them to find a common language.
Just the antivaxxers, antirouškaři and co. would not be able to fill such a big procession or pay for it.
The association Chcípl pes has a rising popularity, it reminds me of Million moments for democracy.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and technology.
It is difficult to say which movement could emerge from this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a four-dose and more.
It will definitely not be a leftist or centrist movement, so don't even think about it.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is clear that we will have to be vaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines saved us.
A genius action by scientists, for which humanity has a right to be proud.
The end of the wait, Bulgaria has a new prime minister announcing change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev entrusted the formation of the new government to Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue the Change, which won the November elections.
Tom has already managed to put together a broad coalition government which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the pressure of anti-corruption protests.
Victorious parties calling for a fight against bribery and abuse of power failed to agree, however, so there followed two snap elections.
What do cats do when nobody is watching?
The global hit is made from secretly taken footage.
In Britain over the weekend grew concerns about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been missing in London for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago, when she drove home from work in the south of the British capital.
According to information about the employee of a children's hospital, in addition to the police, her previous employer or the MP representing the part of London where she lived is also being called.
The disappearance of Petra "bears no resemblance to her behavior and we are getting very worried about her," Lucy O'Connor, from Lambeth police station where Petra worked, said in a video released on Saturday.
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is, she continued.
The missing Czech woman, according to her, left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28, and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last seen in a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her colleagues on December 3.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "healthcare assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.
We have enormous fears for our dear colleague Petra, who is missing, said the group of healthcare facilities in a twitter post.
We want to appeal to anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police,' the statement continued.

In Ústí nad Labem, there was a month-long hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover.
It was about life.
The municipality referred the complaints to the ŘSD, which owns the road, and since it did not react, the pothole got worse.
Ultimately, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the ŘSD "began to address the situation intensively."
