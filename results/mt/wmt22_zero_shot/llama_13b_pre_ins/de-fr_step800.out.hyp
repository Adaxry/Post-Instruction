Bonjour, j'ai déjà écrit hier à un collègue de vous et n'ai pas encore reçu de réponse.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#)
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
Je vous prie de me contacter le plus rapidement possible.
The cupboard is currently not usable.
The locomotive control of the LokSound 5 has again been fundamentally improved.
A PWM frequency that can be variably set from 10 kHz to 50 kHz ensures super-quiet operation in particular with bell-crank motors – the typical "buzzing" belongs to the past.
The load regulation can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows the automatic adjustment of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 decoder delivers enough juice for even older motors with up to 1.5A motor current.

New York holt erstmals MLS-Meisterschaft
New York City FC a remporté pour la première fois le titre dans la Major League Soccer.
After the 1:1 in regular time against hosts Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference won the final in a penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York beat Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fantag
The Europa Park, namesake for the Europa Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announced, members and annual pass holders of the sports club from Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa Park free of charge on this day.
There were also vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains shone red and white that day through the jerseys.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa Park, it was once again demonstrated how well the partnership fits.
Radiating fans having fun together in the roller coaster confirm this, says Europa Park owner Jürgen Mack.
J'ai un total de 5 livres.
4 d'entre eux partent.
Just the one thing I bought today doesn't work
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And not cancel the entire order.

Enfant, 4 ans, éclats sous le pouce
Child, four years old, has wooden splinters under the thumbnail (outer side).
Tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
N'a pas marché et a fait mal.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
Pas une chance.
Tomorrow I go to the doctor.
Il fonctionne.
Many many thanks for the help
Wish you a nice evening
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and take it to the post office, right?
Do I have to do anything else here?

Warum Kinder keine Tyrannen sind Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW violence psychique, abus sexuel, abus de pouvoir
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it immediately.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008) he triggered a fierce debate about education.
Former patients and those with parental responsibility are now making serious allegations against him.
Please be aware that the film is difficult to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Never, never, never should it be about power over the child to our parents and other carers!
Our goal must always be to give children room to develop and to create a framework for the child that is as large as possible in the given situation.
Brrr, ça me fait toujours frissonner.
J'ai besoin d'un rappel, mon meuble en bois livré est défectueux.

I was in chat with #PRS_ORG and they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my locker.
J'ai pas pu acheter de livres pendant 2 semaines.
Après confirmation, on obtient toujours la même erreur : oops - quelque chose est allé mal - essayez plus tard.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.

I get the mail that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I've tried calling #PRS_ORG and getting it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and the order is cancelled again?
Unfortunately, it would mean for me that I would not order it again, because it has already taken a very long time.
Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or simply for cuddling - My little warm friend is versatile.
Rowan berry pillows are a traditional home remedy for beneficial warmth applications, as rowan berries absorb and release heat very well.
The detachable inner cushion is very easy to warm up in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft fabric makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cushion with a cover is suitable as a heat pad for the following applications:
Before warming up the kiss, check for atypical smell or spots and remove immediately if present.

Lahnsteiner Wehr for water rescue equipped: 45,000 euro subsidy from the state
Recently the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz presented a donation certificate in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the voluntary fire brigade Lahnstein to the mayor of Lahnstein, Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to €135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatine is supporting us with this, says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatine.
Above and below water, they carry out tasks in water and ice rescue, as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they are permanently expecting increasing demand: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
Here, the lower part, i.e. the part with the loading space, was damaged.
Will everything then be taken away again, or just the loading area?

Theme of the week: The best low budget films
What exactly a low-budget film is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>Un **film de faible budget** ou un **film de faible budget** est un film tourné avec peu ou pas d'argent des studios de cinéma ou des investisseurs privés.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films on the web, for example on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?

Rouladen Tipps & Tricks
I got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
There was one at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and creamy!
Merci encore pour ça.
Now I've acquired a taste for it and want to cook rouladen for New Year's for the first time.
Tomorrow I will set up a beef fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a big pot.
And with the voucher?
Apart from that, am I no longer a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now have to pay the full price.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
Je suis intéressé par le #PRS_ORG# siège.
Mais je ne sais pas combien le siège est haut...
Non, c'est pour tous les livres, c'est pourquoi la requête est faite à # PRS_ORG #, car il s'agit probablement d'un problème général.
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour rendering.
The colour temperature and brightness of the lamp are set by a modern microprocessor with exceptional features.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set the color temperature in the range from 3100 to 5650K and save it.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to use.
The lamp generates a very high light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120-degree angle of emission, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work with both on set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller enables the remote control of the light in television studios or if the light is mounted in difficult to access places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in delivery)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
To set the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, you just have to press one of the storage buttons for a longer time and you're done.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the familiar situation is restored - Very practical when working in the studio, for example, if the camera is set to specific colour temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 Functionality is derived from the possibility of using economical NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can fall back on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before setting off whether the batteries have enough power – it has a built-in battery tester – for each of the two battery bays a value is displayed in the two display units (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, of course, it is possible to supply the headlights continuously with power through the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm hose for fixing, so you can connect it directly to your photo stand.
The inclination is reliably set using stops on both sides.
It was ensured that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a steering gear is included in the scope of delivery.
It is also great that a bag is included in the delivery.
This way, you can safely transport or store the light with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Air pumps are perfect for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using an airlift.
This series is available in three versions from us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
You can compare the services there.
If the pumps are powerful enough, entire plants can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect more outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. But if you want to add an accent to your aquarium, for example with an air curtain (find them in our shop), or with decoration that turns the air bubbles into a function.
Here one could mention a treasure chest, mussel or something similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to a regulator via an air hose 4/6 mm...and it's ready to go.
The fan pump should be the same, or higher than the water level, and mounted outside.
If the fan pump sits lower than the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent water from flowing backward once it starts flowing through the pump...
If the fan is to be located outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps.
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify a processing time of 3 days on eBay, the parcels are packed every day and picked up here every day.
If everything goes well while travelling, it goes very quickly.
We just wanted to prevent anyone from being disappointed because it took a little longer this time.
It's like that, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics sector... of course the coronavirus makes no difference here.
Please don't judge too harshly, just because the delivery is delayed, that is exclusively the fault of the shipping services.
Naturellement, on se plaint volontiers de ces services, même si on dit actuellement...
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
Pourriez-vous m'envoyer les trois variantes par email et me dire comment je les atteins le mieux.
Pillenproblem
Bonjour chères femmes,
I hope I'm doing this right, this is actually my first post after a year on reddit.
To my problem: I went back on the pill, reluctantly, about five years ago because I was having unbelievably bad period pain and PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it at that, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had an explosive outbreak of pimples, from 0 to 100, during my last two-year break and they were everywhere.
So superficially, but that really got to me and I did not feel good.
During the two-year break, things were never really normalized.
Perhaps someone has some tips on how to avoid it this time.
Perfume-free and without noise is my cosmetics already, but maybe someone can recommend something to me.
Unfortunately, the gynaecologist did not take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still pending.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the skin is such a thing.
Had terrible neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then large-scale acne and the acne topic.
I have also tried everything possible in terms of nutrition in the course of my Christian illness and have remained on a sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed diet, because otherwise nothing has really worked properly.
It can also be good that the worm is just hormonal, but if you have building sites everywhere like I do, you just want to stop looking for what else is wrong.
J'ai déjà envoyé une mail, que vous n'avez pas répondu.
La question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
Le transporteur est la société #NAME#.
J'ai appelé juste là.
I was told they would only deliver to the door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Est-ce vrai?
If so, I will have to cancel the order, as I do not know anyone who can help me carry the heavy furniture upstairs.
won't I be called?
J'ai formulé une question
If I download a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message I get is: Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorise this book
Is there a problem there?
Gutschein klingt super
Then I add it to the new order myself
Many thanks for the quick clarification!
Ordentlicher durch Kind?
Bonjour, je (w32) occupe une chose depuis longtemps.
I am very disciplined and organised at work (self-employed, very little free time), but for as long as I can remember, I have struggled to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases when everything stays the same, and then every now and then I get an urge and sort and clean.
But it is actually never so "that someone could come by spontaneously".
My husband (unfortunately) isn't any better either, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly the budget just loses against work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly as we love to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become decent people?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it and this question has been keeping me busy for a while.
Because for me I've got no incentive, I just don't like it so much, as long as no one visits and, for example, there's always fresh clothes there and the kitchen is usable.
Does having children give you more motivation or do you stay lazy?
Looking forward to your answers.
J'aimerais recevoir un code promo

Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is now the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary island.
Until now, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has declined in recent days, but volcanologists dared not make any predictions about when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Dommages en millions
In the almost three months since the start of the eruption, the more than 1,000-degree-hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Just under 1200 hectares were covered by a layer of lava one metre thick.
C'est presque 1700 terrains de football.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new land masses with a total area of around 50 hectares have emerged through cooled lava.
The banana industry, which is of immense importance for the island and employs around half of its 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly, was hit particularly hard. The industry was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and further areas were heavily affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
I have ordered a lamp shade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipping take?
We don't need to have discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "spinner", which doesn't sound nearly as appetising.

Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his brow.
C'est fini.
After a driving error and a slight brush with the barrier, Räikkönen had to retire from the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi after not even half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the motorsport royal class.
To say goodbye, his wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the world championship in 2007 in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the pole and came to the podium 103 times. dpa
If it doesn't work, I'd be happy with a discount or voucher.
Perhaps I will find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over €1,000 for goods I don't need is a bit too much.
The main compartment can also be adapted: with three individually placed and foldable Velcro closure parts, it can be tailored to your exact photo equipment needs, and is suitable for all types of cameras – from compact system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits into the rucksack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible equipment could be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and an external flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various Sony a7 models or a Fujifilm X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
You can also store all sorts of accessories.
And anyone with a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the rucksack for their equipment and for things unrelated to photography.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also an excellent choice for drone pilots, as it provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Yes, the F-parts are
J'ai reçu un lit de vous.
However, there were problems with a part.

Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who places value on reliability and safety when braking, even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made from cast iron and then mechanically worked (drilled and cut).
All tinted glass is produced in short series according to individual technical properties, which are typical for certain glass and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is aimed at the milling of the disc according to the properties of the original assembly.
The tinted glass produced in this way ensures high comfort and brake efficiency.
Additional openings improve the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the notches improve the cleaning of brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tinted glass underline the character of every car with attractive and striking appearance.
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it's also good for big brothers and sisters to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Un moment regarder, un moment aider, un moment apporter la bouteille etc.
This way they learn responsibility, help in the family and are included.
So long as they are still able to be children themselves, I see no problem there.
If your K1 is happy to be alone for a while and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best judge whether this is suitable for your children.
It is not as if he should wrap up K2 and spend hours putting it to sleep.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is why the psychologist's statement is true.
Because if something were to happen, like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to have to worry about K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you.

The protein in the food is broken down in the bird's gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and the bird uses these to build its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the formation of new feathers in the maturing bird are extremely complex processes and are particularly demanding for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON Bio should not be administered during breeding, as this can lead to disruptions in the breeding process.
Following this brief gift of NECTON-Bio, the daily supply with NECTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NECTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
A crossed-out spoon (inlay) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON Bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the start of feather regrowth is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose will be administered until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
According to Iranian information, progress is being made in the negotiations for the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
Both sides are about to agree on the topics that are on the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development," he says, because initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement had continued after almost a week of interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the talks.
A US delegation is also in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.

Amazon-Gründer Bezos schickt Tochter und Moderatorin ins Weltall
The daughter of the first US American in space, a TV moderator and four other passengers have made a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a radiant blue sky, Bezos personally greeted the freshly groomed astronauts after their return.
“Welcome back,” Bezos said, wearing a blue spacesuit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, the flight lasted ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard, who flew into space (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin was named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honoured guests of the company; the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their tickets, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley rappela la mission de son père après le court vol.
He had to work hard during his deployments and do everything himself.
She just went along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan zeigte sich ebenfalls begeistert.
He would prefer to return to space immediately, the moderator said.
„New Shepard“ fliegt bis in 100 Kilometer Höhe
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automatically.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of around 100 kilometres above the Earth, sometimes in weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the boundary of space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin's third manned spaceflight: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was himself on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present at the second in October, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's vice president, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
DRG/DR Altbau model of the E-Lok E 95 03, the locomotive was used in Silesia and central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably originates from the conversion proposal of the model railway enthusiast ME Heft 11/1968. Used, with play wear and missing parts, see photos, Functions well, The E 95 series is a heavy freight locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn Gesellschaft (DRG), conceived for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the model set also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we have refurbished it for operation
In 1924 the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to put forward proposals for an electric locomotive that could haul 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at 45 km/h.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery of the locomotive as a 1'C+C1' locomotive with cardan drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01 to 06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves back in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were delivered to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
All six locomotives were judged to be worth rebuilding at the Dessau Railway Repair Works.
As demand for locomotives to haul heavy freight trains increased with the gradual electrification of the central German network, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were rebuilt in 1959, with the remaining locomotives being used as donors for spare parts.
First of all, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 locomotives that were available in large numbers were used.
It was only when it became clear that the E 94 could not be further upgraded that the E 95 came into view for upgrading.
First the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig Wahren depot.
They came to the Halle P depot in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal to Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of locomotives proved problematic.
As a result, it often happened that the shooter remained stuck during switching operations.
Then the fireman, who was permanently in attendance on this locomotive, had to use a hammer and chisel to free the piston again during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred more frequently and led to long periods of downtime for the locomotive.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new build locomotives available and an obvious expansion of the electrical service was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most of the fragment categories, so that the E 95 was taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to operate electric locomotives with only one crew member, which due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and visibility from the driver's cab would have been a problem for train operations.
After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service in the middle of 1969, they were followed by the E 95 01, which retired on 5 October 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was put on display at the main station in Halle as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10.
It took some time for those responsible at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worthy of preservation as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external processing of the locomotive began, with the aim of presenting it at the RAW Dessau vehicle show.
Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
The locomotive is cared for in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995 employees of the Bw Halle P tradition association have been working on making the locomotive operational.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Arnstadt depot museum with new internal and external paint, while the transformers were checked and five traction motors were made operational.
The locomotives were in service on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branch lines until 1945, proving themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945 the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the central German network.
The main area of deployment was initially Silesia
Handworked model H0 in OVP, function good, there are optical aftermarket modifications to the locomotive in own work, smoked, with play tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handworked model, very small edition - possibly the model kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may bear labels and storage marks.
If you extend my voucher, I'll place a larger order straight away, but I did keep the damaged item and didn't send it back.
And I had no way of knowing that last year would turn out differently from how I had imagined it, and that I would not be able to rectify and clarify things in good time.
But the damage I suffered as a customer, and I will not accept that.
When could the cupboard be delivered again?
To keep him is not an option for me...
Stress supplémentaire avant vacances et week-ends fériés
This topic came up last week with me.
I had to use my long weekend now to chill out.
That's why there's a post about it now.
It's not just around big holidays, like Christmas, that there's a lot of stress in our business.
As it seems there is also one before holidays and bridge holidays.
It was like this: Last week was the Ascension of Mary, which is called the "Assumption" with us in Switzerland.
On Friday most people and businesses make a bridging day, which is semi-official.
There was a long four-day weekend last week.
What happened last week?
Stress partout.
According to a number of emails that absolutely had to be sent before departure, order here order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Parce... parce?
Because "next week then" sounds too long after so much time?
Or because people want to do as much in a shortened week as they do in a normal week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also mightily annoyed.
What is this self-sacrifice for holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very independent.
My question is simply this: Are we the only ones, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Perfect, that's right :) do I need to do anything else?
Do they just need the tracking number in my email?
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The rewording of advertising slogans to vaccination appeals - after the German model - should also increase the willingness to be vaccinated.
I had a huge argument with you then #NUMBER# when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# chest of drawers.
Je suis pour que tous se représentent avec des pronoms
J'ai envoyé une candidature.
Today came the invitation to a conversation by mail.
Je veux répondre à l'e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
J'ai googlé et selon le pays culturel d'où il/elle vient, c'est un homme ou une femme.
**Je ne sais pas comment je vais écrire l'email maintenant.
Pourriez-vous m'aider s'il vous plaît?
** Je suis un étranger et je ne veux pas marcher sur les pieds d'un fonctionnaire.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine pronouns.
J'ai acheté 6 #PRS_ORG# et voulais acheter 8.
Mais il n'y en avait plus.
They are now available again and I would like to add two chairs to your order and charge you for them.

Noël et les cadeaux
Christmas is just around the corner and the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring our increasingly divided society together.
So it is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gestures of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract between primitive peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became Christkind
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas days with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day in one way or another.
The background of this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold coins through the window of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
The popular German custom of filling children's boots with presents arose from this unconventional way of giving.
Protestants bumped into this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and man as "saint worship."
For these reasons, they are wary of the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas into the Christ child and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of the gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants do not see such detailed questions so closely any more, it only annoys a small number that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to the Martin custom with Martin singing and Martin procession, is still a firm part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today one can find boots on the doorstep and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches, everything that the heart desires.
Diversité des traditions dans les pays chrétiens
Sources document a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was moved to Christmas.
However, in all Christian countries, a joyful muddle reigns over the question of who will now bring the presents to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ child appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who is in principle a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been ascribed over time.
For example, his white ruffled beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain the Three Wise Men give the presents, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have led them to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who brought fame.
It's not reindeer pulling his sleigh, here, but three horses as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite wars, the Christ child is responsible for handing over the gifts.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Très triste.
I hope that this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, since the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
Yes, I believe that, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the ceiling shipped to Germany

Ref: Planifier l'enseignement (EK)
Bonjour chers collègues,
I have been a referee since the summer, I enjoy teaching, but at the moment I have big problems planning my geography lessons efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not very well equipped, so in principle I can only use the whiteboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
At the moment, I simply need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, at the moment, we are dealing with the topic of geo-factors and with me, every hour stands on its own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I need this time for UBs etc.).
When I'm planning, I always start with the learning objective (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Thus also the working sheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
Would really make me happy.
Career in social work - as someone with a personality disorder?
I did a training in the field of software development and have been working for about a year.
Unfortunately, however, I notice more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-uncertain (or fear-avoiding) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
This means, roughly speaking, that I have no self-esteem and am consequently shy.
I don't have a problem talking to people on a factual level, but it's very hard for me to have a relaxed conversation and I've been told many times that I come across as aloof (which I think I've gotten better at).
Pourrais-je devenir un travailleur social?
I don't want to work as a street worker or at an open youth club; I'd rather work in things like addiction counselling or family support.
But I don't know if the actual working day is really like I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find anything about it online.
The ÄVPS is already causing me problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because every time there is something to criticise in my code ("once again, the simplest things are fucked up"), and it is difficult for me to ask experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know by now how it works" / "I distract him from his work with my stupid questions" / "he must think I'm a complete idiot" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession, but I wanted to mention it here.
I have been looking for a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.
I was told that one was sent to me.
Since I have not received any (also not in the SPAM folder), I wanted to ask how long this usually takes.
Merci beaucoup.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note and also served as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I received my order today, unfortunately, the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table bone has imprint.
The color of the first delivery was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or what?
La marchandise a coûté moins de 20 euros.
La taxe correspond à 40% du coût de revient....
I am a #PRS_ORG# customer and therefore it is not a problem for me.
All I need is one number or instruction as to where I should send the parcel so that it can be returned to you.
Could you please help me find the title of a book?
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me, no matter how hard I try. Maybe someone here knows the answer...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by drowning in feed and going into the enclosure with his big cats.
The case is taken over by a female detective who, after a brief investigation, confronts his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of the suicide and document it and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs some kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses fear centers in the brain and the patients ultimately face their fears in the most extreme way possible.
Une femme saute par la fenêtre, une autre se tue intentionnellement)
This fight against fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital that had to do with the fire.
That is the rough plot I am quite sure the book was written by a French author / authoress.
If this action is known to anyone or if someone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Something completely different: At the time, I realised that many religious education teachers did not believe in God, and for them it was just another subject like maths or geography.
For me it was always something strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed.
Comment vous sentez-vous?
Perhaps you can also tell from colleagues at work or study with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional, and it makes sense to separate the two.
Yes, there is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes someone want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Culture or something else?
I hope the question is not too personal.

Voiture contre arbre: conducteur mortellement blessé
The 53-year-old had crashed into a central reservation on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for reasons still under investigation, according to police.
There was a head-on collision with a vehicle driven by a 27-year-old.
The car of the 53-year-old was then hurled into a tree and the man in the car was trapped.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel des MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg beim Merlins Crailsheim
At least on youngster Johannes Patrick he could rely.
Again nothing: For the second time within not even three months, the giants in Crailsheim - and how!
Prior to the game, Ludwigsburg's trainer John Patrick looked back to the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
But after the game, she didn't go to bed - she actually increased her performance in the face of the 61:72 (28: 38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
While more than the bare result disappointed with the way the performance was.
A representative statistic is one that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point quote was just 13 percent, four shots (all by young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick gave the answer: "After the victory at Tenerife, we were simply not concentrated enough and did not do what we trained for."
Namely, to move the ball.
His opposite number, Sebastian Gleim, reacted quite differently: "A great game to win again at Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
C'est comme si 10 000 personnes étaient là.
Only 750 spectators were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered his team's game.
Gleim praised: "The best playmaker I have ever coached."
While in Patrick's team, the performance players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points after they had already lost 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for arguing.
Already on Wednesday (7 p.m.) the Giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
J'avais déjà tout de sa collègue.
Written and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what was said in response to my concern.
I had to keep working in between and suddenly everything was gone...
It does not help much, since I have waited for it since September.
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price at pickup?
So that the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap and water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you bring the brush with a new color to the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do that on the inside of the parts, which you can no longer see, or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Pull the brush stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers creates an even surface later.
Avoid quickly wiping with the brush.
This results in unrealistic looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Begin with the bright colors.
The dark could otherwise shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to a close with a separate brush.
Otherwise it can lead to ugly metal flakes when they mix with normal colours.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you assemble them.
The models have an authentic appearance thanks to the decals or stickers.
From national emblems on aircraft to ship's names and decorative strips and number plates on model cars: the decals give the model its finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the right order, as long as the parts are still easily accessible.
A plane cockpit can be covered or laminated before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool like scissors, tweezers and toothpicks is having time, patience and a steady hand when gluing.
Cut out each required decal and arrange them.
Decals are also known as water slide images because you briefly moisten their reverse with water until the carrier paper goes dark with moisture.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit off the paper and put the piece in the right place on the model (which you also wet beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper to the side.
Warning: Always check first whether the picture is correctly positioned before sliding it off the paper completely so that it doesn't stick to your fingers, knit or even tear.
Excess water with a household towel.
Warning not suitable for children under 3 years
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I already had the ceiling in my shopping cart and could buy it now!
Comment faire?
Bref.
RBTV a promis beaucoup.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this broadcaster are now under all sorts of pressure.
Nearly every format is sponsored (ok), but then immediately go on a big begging tour.
It was said that one was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: One doesn't want to be a "moving pillar".

An 0815 advertiser trying to get his billboard to the elite fan.

Naturally, this applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Naturally, they can continue to insult people.

Tire choice for racing bike - really that safe?
This morning, I woke up full of energy because I wanted to do at least a little training for my bike tour next week.
Said, done, and I went for a ride on my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then it happened what lurks in every inner city (this time: thanks Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear wheel did not want to take part in the rest of the track.
Since I had no real possibility on account of the weekend to get hold of a replacement coat and replacement hose, I had to turn around again and take the first train home.
It was not so bad for once, perhaps it is better if I practise changing the tire again before the bike tour.
Now I'm faced with a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long stretch over several days ahead of me, I would rather not get this problem more often.
It was not that bad now, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who rode 120km the day I picked up the bike!) were also still there, and he had already described them as suboptimal, because he had ridden on them for many years.
But if I think that after 80-90km I still have to change a tire, then I am really in a bad mood :D
Now I've got into conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me why I didn't have Marathon Plus tyres; these are supposed to be indestructible.
Now the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tyre now, only to be disappointed later.
I'm also asking myself: I think I've done 25x622 on the track bike.
There is also (apparently) with the Marathon Plus tyres, but most of it is already wider.
Est-ce un problème?
Or would you generally recommend me other tires for a racing bike?
The swallow side seems to be my absolute favorite! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and loving greetings!
Unfortunately, I'm still waiting for the email from their support.

The "drive" of a tube output stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the valve reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level as well as the distortion of your sounds.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL regulator, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything in the "gain" and distortion.
Further up, it had already been announced that with the POWER LEVEL regulator, a performance reserve can even be activated if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so that even when using headphones or recording directly, you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX input, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you add a VFS5 footswitch, you can also call up the sounds conveniently by foot, switch the effect blocks on and off, and control the tempo of the compatible effects "tapping".
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!

Battery packs and chargers as well as accessories included are excluded from this guarantee extension.
Registration can only take place online at www.bosch-pt.com/warrenty.
Proof of registration is the registration certificate, which has to be printed immediately, and the original purchase receipt, from which the date of purchase can be seen.
Registration is only possible if the buyer agrees to the storage of his data there.
Excluded from the guarantee are parts subject to wear and tear as a result of usage, or wear and tear of any other natural cause, as well as defects to tools caused by usage, anomalous environmental conditions, inappropriate operating conditions, overloading or lack of maintenance or care.
Defects in the tool caused by the use of non-original Bosch accessories, add-ons or replacement parts.
Tools that have undergone changes or additions.
Minor deviations from the specified condition, which are insignificant for the value and usability of the tool.
The rectification of the defect covered by our guarantee will take place in the following way: We will either repair the defective tool free of charge or replace it with a flawless tool (possibly also a new model).
Replaced tools or parts become our property.
Can I cancel an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We will no longer do that.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Independently of this, the guarantee of 24 months applies.
Merci, je l'ai trouvé.

Serious "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television broadcast "Wir in Bayern" has caused fervent consideration.
But unlike on many previous days, the term "Host mi?" was not guessed by the callers this time.
Non, ce n'était pas un "type nerveux".
Und auch keiner, "der alles schnell gehen muss".
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg announced as the solution and thereby probably caused astonishment with many Upper Palatines.
The spectators learnt that "Der Huidlerer" is a rag used to clean the stove.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typically Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the rather well-known dialect word "Houdern".
Which closed an educational gap - probably also for many who have lived in the Amberg room for a long time.
Je suis agacé par Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality on German Sky has deteriorated more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
True, the schedule was far behind due to the delayed start and the crash at the beginning, but they could have still shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons F1 takes precedence and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky DE here had no choice.
Stupid anyway, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race.
Despite that, a small compliment: Commentator Olivier Zwartyes did a good job covering the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then, in Formula 1, commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher once again displayed a lack of knowledge of the rules, as neither knew that you are allowed to change tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change the tires when there were appropriate radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that Verstappen had this possibility.
I think you should just know these basic rules if you are commentating on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It is not the first time that they are puzzled by what is allowed or mandatory according to the rules, both have simply constant uncertainty about the rules.
Generally speaking, the artificial commentary style of Roos is not to his liking, but he does admit that it is a matter of taste.
But I seriously prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL.
This is accompanied by constant tomfoolery, which makes both of them simply seem unprofessional, like ordering coffee with (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or Ralf Schumacher's "UuuuuHD".
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, advertising is simply taking over at Sky; in the closing stages, Sky is the only channel going to advertising, as one can hear on F1TV, where only the German audio track without commentary is available directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF does that.
What is more, these two stations do less advertising in training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster.
Indeed, one has to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone will not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 schedule is also very poor and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that covers F1.
Seriously, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
So the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
I submitted the contact form to return an article yesterday, but did not receive an email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be whether my request has been accepted.
Thüringen überholt Sachsen - Freistaat ist jetzt Bundesland mit der höchsten Corona-Inzidenz
Thüringen has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thüringen had a Corona incidence of over 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thüringen fell slightly, but was also above the value of 1000.
In Thüringen, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths in connection with an infection were reported on the same day.
200 seriously ill Covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
At weekends there can be delays in registration.
In addition, the health authorities have been overburdened for weeks and are barely keeping up with the recording of new cases.
Please send me any transaction number... or anything else that could help
Transfert confirmation... etc
It is time for changes
Dear members of the Bundestag, I greet you. I am in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Pourquoi la poste ici?
If you take a look at the activity of the Bundestag in recent months, you can see one thing: It does not exist.
We're in a winter rut and have extended the summer hole for a few months.
# Où est le problème?
Oui, comment s'est-il passé?
Most of that is probably just down to dissatisfaction, how a few things have panned out and how we are generally doing.
In recent days, the impression has increased that many people here still want to go to the Bundestag.
#Ce que nous devons changer
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is being asked what it wants to do to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who noticed this project in the last few days and found, simply put, a pile of shit.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have been found who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would like to call upon everyone once more to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas and work on concrete things together.
You can enter the server via this link.
Objectifs:
* Comment le Bundestag fonctionnera-t-il dans le futur?
Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
* Comment devons-nous apparaître à l'extérieur dans le futur?
* Comment recruter de nouveaux membres?
* Comment créer un système électoral juste?
Je suis assez certain que j'ai oublié certaines choses, mais ce n'est pas grave, au final, nous avons le Discord.
If you have the will and the time, come to Discord, work with us, and let's decide democratically about the future.
What you describe is called *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under full anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
The most common is to hear noises/voices, less often to see pictures and even less often to feel pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that go hand in hand with an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anesthesia is avoided in order to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned in the anesthesia pre-operative interview.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex by definition had none.
J'ai mal lu son commentaire.
Why is shipping starting on 16.3.?
There was nothing on your website about such long delivery times
Chat connection is gone and now?
J'ai besoin de travailler entretemps!
Bonjour!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Pourriez-vous me le vendre et me le payer en euros?
It is the daily cover #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
I had not restarted the e-#PRS_ORG# before the purchase.
Do you want me to do it now?
Nous n'avons pas touché le siège.
Suddenly the crack was there
Je suis juste assis
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I can't see how high the seat surface is.
Pouvez-vous m'aider davantage?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty wardrobe will be collected promptly.
Et je vous prie de le faire maintenant.
I do not have any suitable packaging, but I will dismantle the cupboard as far as possible for collection - they will have to sort out with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by telephone to arrange a collection date.
Our little one has been sleeping on her tummy from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Un tel enfant tient plus que l'on ne le pense.
Make sure everything around it is right, no cuddly toys, go in and look more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
C'est ce qui te rend fou!
Fresh air in the room.
Bonne matelas.
Pas de coussins.
Achso and we never had a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Observe your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Is it possible to stand up from the gut?
Or is it with the face down in the mattress?
You can deduce from that whether everything is in order.
We've all grown up too, and when my husband became a father, it was just go and get the kids to sleep.
Alors, je veux renvoyer la lampe
Comment je vais le faire?

Breaking news: Serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently a severe traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb North junction and Plößberg.
As the police press release currently states (2:03 p.m.), a passenger car came into the opposite lane while overtaking.

Bonjour, j'ai un article qui devait être livré la semaine dernière et qui n'est toujours pas livré.
J'ai contacté le chat deux fois et j'ai encore rien.
The First Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email and she has never replied.
Where there are still Christmas roasts in Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the presents.
Have you not got any wings yet?
Now the time is tight.
We tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
In order to maintain an optimal field of view, the loupe should be as close as possible to the eye.
The specifically planar-achromatic designed lens system allows you to use the microscope practically free of registration and color errors, even in the edge zone.
Frequently lenses are marked with magnification information.
These specifications are only valid under strictly defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To get the best out of your magnifier, we suggest you follow the instructions in the table "Technical specifications" (See user manual in packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical equipment - including impact lenses.
By applying an antireflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
Under ideal conditions of use - the loupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the attached user manual (available in German and English).

Darmstadt second after the Hinserie - Pauli wins in Dusseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream of returning to the football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
Things are also not going well for Ingolstadt under the third coach.
Celebrations in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hanover about interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Comment va-t-il maintenant?
What about the books? How do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
Mon anglais n'est plus si bon, mais je le supporte.
Bien.
We will no longer order anything from them.
When they add my turnover and that of my friend #NAME# (same address) they have obviously lost good customers.
They are welcome to pass it on to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Does the wardrobe have to be completely dismantled for collection and return?
and when would the pickup be?
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund was triggered and now you're telling me I have to send the thing back.
I can't do anything about the fact that the wardrobe will be completely disrupted when it arrives with me
Veuillez regarder dans le Screenshot ce que le collègue a écrit
It is clear and evident that the repayment was triggered and I still have not received a repayment via #PRS_ORG#
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
Je ne peux pas ouvrir le livre.
I followed their recommendations and synchronized, removed and reloaded the app Nada worked.
I am a little frustrated because the whole operation has cost me a lot of time and I am now hoping for help.
Pour affaiblir les fausses nouvelles - le CEO de Biontech publie un photo de vaccination
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin has so far not spoken publicly about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his coronavirus vaccination.
The illness of a friend had led him to do so, Şahin said.
Biontech CEO and co-founder Uğur Şahin has posted a photo showing how he is being vaccinated against the coronavirus.
On social media, there were false reports that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network.
For a few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counter these false rumors.
Until now, he has rejected this because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to hear that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He did not ask about the reasons.
However, "the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often stoked by false information and mistrust."
It is hard to argue with fear, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating online in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself made clear.
It is currently not allowed for me to get the vaccine myself, Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization of vaccination in Germany.
Meanwhile, prioritization has long been lifted - and the Biontech CEO has had himself vaccinated three times, according to his own statements.
110 kV underground cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is final.
The resolution passed by the government of Lower Bavaria paves the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long underground cable will connect the Tann transformer station in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning, near Reut.
That is precisely what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to take over the return shipping at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a boldness in my eyes.
The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm, and can therefore be built into almost any locomotive of the track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are available with all common interfaces and are always supplied with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker together with a sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multi-protocol decoder.
Il maitrise le format de données DCC tout comme Motorola®, Selectrix® et M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as self-evident as two- and four-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders communicate with a suitable digital control centre automatically.
It can handle all DCC programming modes, and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read from the main track.
For central stations that can only program 1-255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 gears at 255 addresses.
Three further Motorola® addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration with mfx®-compatible central stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognises the Märklin® brake sections as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brake blocks or with direct current.
He also uses a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum train allows automatic pendulum travel between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC tracks.
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
The 20 litre capacity means that even larger photo equipment can be swallowed without any problems, which can be safely stowed away using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need for everyday items stays well organised and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is also presented in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design is iconic - with the Everyday Backpack Series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to the photo equipment.
This works with two options: conventionally via the cover flap, which can be locked with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already been proven with the Messenger Bags.
In the locking mechanism there is a metal locking hook on the front side of the backpack.
In contrast to most rucksacks, Peak Design has thought about various "fill levels": there are 4 anchor points, firmly riveted, into which the closure hook can be fastened.
If the rucksack is fully laden, you just take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Flaps and hooks are also magnetic.
This makes it possible to close the rucksack reliably, without having to thread the buckle.
The second possibility also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: in addition to the flap closure, there is also a tear-off opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday practicality of the rucksack enormously: if you are not only taking your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior to suit your individual needs, and store both your laptop and tablet separately and easily - and access them independently through the two side openings.
For example, you can pull the rucksack from the right side to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday items stay safely in the left rucksack section and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the rucksack is also made from 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents stay dry even if it's going to Scotland in the autumn.
Bonjour, j'ai juste vu que la vitrine #NAME# est vendue.
C'est très dommage.
Is it still being produced?
Is it completely out of stock?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
Statement of a community worker in contradiction to the statute
Bonjour r/LegaladviceGerman,
J'ai le problème suivant.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
Donc requête auprès de la commune.
An employee writes to me that cutting down fruit trees and thus the walnut is not part of the statutes.
However, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree in the statute.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Merci pour vos réponses.
Holetschek: Länder beraten über Abschaffung der Testpflicht für dreifach Geimpfte
The health ministers of the states want to decide at their next meeting about a nationwide abolition of the obligation to take the test for those who have been vaccinated three times.
We countries need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the testing obligation no longer applies to three-time vaccinations, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the health ministers' conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The loss of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional booster shot," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed that "he will put forward a proposal to the health ministers' conference as soon as next Tuesday." - afp
Bummer, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(

I did not receive it and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally inquired.
Last year, I had completely different problems because of Corona and never had time for it.
Et maintenant, on me dit qu'il est fini ce qui me met en colère.
Looking at the chat, it was about the Asare seat.
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It could be complemented with existing furniture and thus we could check in advance whether it matches colorwise
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
During the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing fragments in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were raised, and saloons and hotels arose almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer, searching for wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You will seek gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your peers to avoid going bust with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to manage your resources and build a tableau which works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your board allow you to be more efficient, gain additional actions, or bend the rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays out over a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the board where they can carry out actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their pawns on the appropriate squares.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lockdown!
This deactivates one half of the site - reducing the possible actions that can be carried out there.
Then, players take turns carrying out actions, such as gaining resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning cowboys.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The announcer turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and changes the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, which means that every location has been covered once and the year has ended.
There's a shootout where players must defend Coloma from an angry bandit attack.
If the players have contributed enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive smaller rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is determined.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I take up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm the shipping type, parcel (games folded).
Insured by DPD in most cases, with parcel tracking (games included, wrapped in flyers and packaging paper).
If you are a collector, then for an additional charge of 2 euros, I can also send cardboard in a cardboard box, so that there are 100% no printing spots.
In the name of the people: Lay judges deliver verdicts
In the courtroom, they sit on the judge's bench in everyday clothes.
But their judgement will depend on much more than whether they are wearing a robe: lay judges decide with professional judges whether someone is sent to prison and for how long.
Two of them report from their time at the Bad Kreuznach district court in conversation with the "public": Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the district court on John F. Kennedy Street.
willingly, had ordered the same seat in blue in November and also received it. therefore, because they are so beautiful now, I would like to have one in grey
Yes, what I don't understand is that the other basket was also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
J'ai commandé en novembre.
Here: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multicoloured glass x 1
But others saw it differently.
Is it then possible for you to send the lamp back?
Because it is too low over the table?
So, I would like to send them back.
Pourriez-vous me continuer à aider?
Shame, I would have liked to carry on ordering from you, but if my voucher isn't taken into account, then I won't be ordering again.
If you change your mind, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.

Yvonne Catterfeld se réjouit de Noël en Thuringe
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but doesn't have any presents yet.
What is beautiful, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you just go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She would agree to the festival by baking biscuits and cakes with her son.
Ich liebe das, sagte Catterfeld.
Until the more serene days, however, she still has some things to do: "For the first time I don't have any presents, I have to get started now".
Merci tout de même!
Alors, je le ferai ailleurs si l'argent revient.
But will I get it back easily?
Mais le siège est défectueux.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros don't help either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation and is also standard practice in e-commerce.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
Désolé, mais parce qu'il dit qu'il n'est pas antisémite, ça ne veut pas dire grand-chose.
That is like when an AfD supporter says they have nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
Mais Kollegah reproduit constamment des messages antisémites.
If you want to distance yourself, then just leave it at that.
Wow, then you're as unserious as Kollegah.
Anyone who fundamentally questions evolution is simply lost.
For my sake, a God has set the whole thing in motion.
Mais si vous êtes créationniste, vous devez croire que la Terre a 10.000 ans et que la science ne raconte que des bobards.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
But that comes much later
Et j'ai encore des frais de port à payer
Thank you first of all for standing up for this, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar activity, so we were also armed guards in the executive, I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, one should say that the civil servant usually comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
That of course, uniform and weapon bearers, should also be clear to everyone that these people then have difficulty with the lived reality, of course, because you have the average white guy, now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggerated feminine stereotypes, because they are rather less common in the executive, but normal men and women, who you wouldn't notice if they didn't tell you, and also on these people I can and must rely, because in doubt they will save your life or put it on the line for you.
But even these fringe groups, in my experience, represent a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel that they are rather less disadvantaged by exaggerated left-wing policies, even if these policies are supposedly for their benefit or they think they have to do it, they just want to be treated normally.
Back to civil liberties, of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, and you will of course find extreme right-wingers there, but the fact that they are allowed to say their opinion openly, or even formulate any subversive plans, is a complete exaggeration by the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it also happens that police officers and soldiers, who were often on missions abroad, often start to generalise and say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that like-minded people meet and carry out a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, something like that is well combated in my opinion and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so deeply involved internationally and that is a good thing in my opinion, that we could never afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!

Bonjour chères filles et filles et femmes,
J'ai quelque chose que je veux simplement écrire et peut-être va-t-il au-devant de l'un - ou de l'autre...
I'm 24, I have PTBS, I'm a full-time student and a dog mama - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't cry or go to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (we've been together since 6th grade) is sick, got a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him, because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because his hand was in a cast due to burns).
He's aloof on top of that, and we're seeing each other less (1-2 times a week) at the moment, which is causing me problems with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child has just had a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I sat with the heat lamp and stroked him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month.
Now housework has also come to us, which we will share of course.
Mais cuisiner est justement beaucoup de travail pour moi...
My post-traumatic stress disorder is currently doing very well, I am half-way through my treatment and am managing.
Not good, but I get by and am almost symptom-free.
My university demands a lot from me at the moment (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I have done nothing and on Thursday anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week I've got an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no space left.
So goes my week: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
Mais ensuite, tout continue?
Just until the birthday.
Just until the start of the holidays.
Just until the weekend.
Jusqu'à...
And so it goes on.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental signposts, otherwise I'd go nuts.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it any other way...
Est-ce que ça vous arrive aussi?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I do not have to work.
Really unbelievably grateful, I can't put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived otherwise.
I think that has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I'd find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you a relaxing evening anyway, the week is almost over!
Due to Omikron: Johnson wants to advance vaccination
Politics and science in Great Britain are dealing with new Omikron cases.
All qualified adults in England should receive an offer of vaccination by New Year's Eve.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move faster with the coronavirus booster vaccines in the face of rapidly rising omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
Until now, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support to speed up the vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
One is facing an emergency with the omikron variant, which is why the vaccination programme must be stepped up urgently, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccine dose.
Vous pouvez maintenant vous booster, a dit Johnson.
On Sunday, another 1,239 cases of omicron were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a full 65 percent. dpa

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into every bed, garden area or rock garden.
The light is simply erected and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in batteries.
Durée de vie max. 10 h.
The robust plastic version is usable all year round outdoors.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally.
In contrast, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light glows fascinatingly – optionally in white or coloured light (in six different colour tones).
The seamless, amorphous design is deliberate: By day, this modern light object presents itself like a naturally formed large pebble.
Its organic rounded shapes fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can hold his own thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparation work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires neither cables nor batteries.
Place the "glowing stone" on any sunlit spot you like.
Two earth spikes that come with it provide a firm grip if necessary.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module conceals "Smart Stone" discreetly inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white light, the other for coloured light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
As dusk falls, the "Smart Stone" begins to glow on its own; in which colour, you choose: Six attractive light colours are available to you – in addition to daylight white.
It ultimately switches off automatically when the battery charging level drops to a predetermined minimum or when it gets light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the loading cycle starts the next day from the beginning.
Okay, c'est comme ça.

NEKTON Bio supports a smooth moult and feather renewal.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage in birdkeeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the feathers are made up of protein-containing substances, a particularly nutrient-rich and balanced protein diet is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather coat.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to inadequate or imbalanced feeding and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced out.
While NEKTON-Bio is being used, no other vitamin preparation should be given.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be simply administered via the drinking water or the soft feed.
As my voucher will no longer be extended because of a complaint that has not reached me, I will cancel my order worth approx.

The trade fears for Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
Only those who have been vaccinated or recovered may enter most businesses.
The trade thinks this is unnecessary and complains about a drop in turnover.
Il a une solution possible prête.
The 2G regulations, from the point of view of the German trade association (HDE), are harming retail trade's important Christmas business.
Sales slumps have to be reported for businesses with non-daily necessities, criticised HDE managing director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey of 1,100 retailers by the HDE, more than 70 percent of companies viewed the remaining days of the year negatively.
Many had already written off Christmas business.
What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is often now a hole without a bottom, said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis turnover in the expired week.
Things are only going well in grocery retail and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The shopping with masks, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
2G when shopping doesn't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic, he stressed.
The current regulations scared off customers and required a high level of staff deployment.
The bandage regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, every customer will only have to be checked for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) once, and will receive a wristband on that day for access to all businesses.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - sample checks should be sufficient.
The property company specialising in shopping centres, Deutsche Euroshop, also reported a difficult Christmas business.
Frequencies were recently at around 75 percent of pre-corona levels, turnover at around 90 percent.
These figures will certainly fall in the middle of such an important Christmas business," managing director Wilhelm Wellner told the "Wirtschaftswoche" business weekly.
Due to the high personal and administrative expense, the centers are attempting to find solutions and receive approval.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, where "visitors, for example, once prove their 2G at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel - can enter all businesses without being disturbed". dpa

Residential fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in an apartment in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has occurred, the police reported on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the neighbouring house in Kinsau (district of Landsberg am Lech).
According to the information, two residents were taken to the hospital on Sunday with minor smoke poisoning.
The precise cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume that it was arson.
The Fürstenfeldbruck CID has taken over further investigations.

Arcane sur Netflix : qu'est-ce que la série vaut pour League of Legends ?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, an amazing production: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we excited about the already announced two seasons?
First on the #PRS_ORG#
This has been working for about.
14 days no longer.
So I have always bought the last books via the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
Following the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would once again receive an update.
SOLO 15 is the name of the newcomer and is optically reminiscent of the big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM
However, this building proposal includes a suitably designed foot to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length to suit the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited to people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of generating such high sound pressure levels unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it is remarkable for its size and extremely impressive and accurate.
The SOLO 15 was tuned to a slightly higher pitch.
This is a common practice with broadband in general in order to optimise the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
Exactly aimed at the listening position, the SOLO 15 convinces with its very clear and fine sound.
The high frequency range can be reduced slightly and the sound image made warmer by turning the treble down slightly.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a musical piece can be measured in the optimal stereo triangle with razor sharpness and breathtaking precision.
The reference-suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an enemy dynamic that is similar to its own.
The SOLO 15 thus not only supplements our SOLO series, but also extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our construction projects, it is recommended to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning, in order to plan any changes to the construction.
If you want to veneer the housing, the speaker must be lowered accordingly, as the veneer adds extra material.
After all the plates have been cut to size (e.g. at a DIY store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floorboard at the corresponding point, so that the cable can be run through it easily later.
With the help of an upper molding, the speaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
On the back, this opening should be equipped with a 45° phase to design the opening area of the speaker chassis as large as possible.
The four connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture "detail phase".
After that, one begins with the actual construction of the box and places one of the two side walls on a level surface in front of you.
These are now glued to the back, the lid, the front and the floor.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in thickness as required, for example when using ready-made profiles from the DIY store instead of making your own from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side will be attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, that is, both sides and the front.
By using an appropriate hole saw or a forestry drill, the installation of the bass reflex tube openings, as well as the connecting clamp on the rear wall, is facilitated.
Afterwards, one uses a round saw to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top side of the footplate can also be rounded off.
Next, the base plate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally secured with long wooden screws.
This is followed by the marking out and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill bit) of the speaker chassis mounting points and the connection terminal.
After the casing has been cleaned of wood dust (sucked / blown), the cables are laid.
This is easiest to achieve by the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
To do this, the entire, uncut cable is pushed through the 8 mm drilling in the foot, piece by piece, until the terminal opening, and is allowed to protrude there by about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and is also left hanging loosely there.
Following this, the frequency switch is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Installation instructions Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency switch is built in and the connection terminal is screwed down, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
By means of the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a bit of cleverness, one can drop hot glue onto the opening and seal it shut.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now comes the dampening, according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and fastened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the plus pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and pushed in.
To dampen, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
We had a different email address before, but I changed it.
How long does it take to get the yellow with and without armrests?

Police shoot dead suspected bank robbers near the royal palace
Close to the Kensington Palace in London a man armed with a knife was shot dead by the police on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man armed with a weapon who had gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was stopped by officers a short time later.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was still declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations with the sale of conifers.
On one occasion a man even drove home without his partner because they could not agree.

Always as if from the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to enthrall his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
At the moment he is touring with the programme "Bonjour, mon bonheur" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on the instructions of the authorities" to combat the coronavirus.
Several of his planned appearances over the Advent period will also have to be cancelled, as it says on the singer's website, who turns 59 today, and his musicians' (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to catch up on their already postponed dates in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian town of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with passion for a long time.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Women don't mind" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
Il l'a fait sortir de la niche dans le mainstream.
Always impeccably dressed, his blond hair strictly slicked back, and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer unnoticed in the current German-speaking music scene.
With the programme "Good morning, dear happiness" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Aujourd'hui, j'ai eu un entretien avec une collègue que j'aime bien.
She herself used to live as a vegetarian for a while, and currently probably eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism had been a planned interim step, I answered honestly without having to think about it much.
And it was that I long thought that as a vegetarian I would be supporting animal welfare, but at some point I reflected on it and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
So my decision to go vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that discontent arose on their side, she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian you reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "blunt"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, one is quickly pushed into a corner and conflicts arise that one would not want to have.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;

Warning: I will write something about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something from the soul.
As a 21-year-old, I often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A theme that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs all too often is that many victims do not want to be helped or think we could not help them.
It is quite clear to me that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation between four walls, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach everyone.
I do not know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is that everyone is worth living without violence.
J'aimerais que toutes les femmes sachent qu'elles ne doivent pas simplement supporter la violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
It will never get any easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
Fertility treatment with private health insurance / What is an "insurance case"?
Bonjour,
We had been undergoing fertility treatment for some time, and now, when it comes to billing the health insurance company, they are suddenly balking.
One after the other:
We had applied to the health insurance company in advance for the fertility treatment and were given permission for three attempts.
The experiments were in no way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.) restricted.
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth, which was accounted for with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count these towards our statutory health insurance.
We again applied for the costs to be taken over by the PKV and were again granted 3 further attempts.
After some more attempts (we carried out more trials than we agreed, logically the most expensive with the PKV) we sent the bills to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 trials (2 + 3) the PKV only wants to refund 3 trials.
The justification: With the pregnancy/birth, the other 2 attempts of the first promise fall away.
The second pregnancy is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, however, "the insurance case begins with the healing treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or we (5 attempts have to be made)?
* Did the PKV have to tell us that with a birth the further attempts would be cancelled?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here gave their opinion.
Many thanks for your help already!
Half victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can claim a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus's border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU had not solved the confrontation in a sustainable way, the researcher of the Berlin foundation Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) explained.
This state of limbo - Belarus doesn't quite give in, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably go on for a while.
The treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Apparently, there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided against this, it is to the detriment of fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakens the cohesion in the Union.
It seems that they cannot assert themselves if a member state insists on going its own way, as is currently the case with Poland, which is not even allowing the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy on the border with Belarus, says Bossong: An agreement on the basic principles of asylum policy is made more difficult, since the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Renewed attempt to cross the border
According to information from Poland's border protection, migrants have again attempted to enter Poland via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and taken back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officers were attacked with stones by the migrants near the place Czeremsza.
According to the statement, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border protection registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or tried to do so.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of being the ruler in Minsk, luring him with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
EU commissioners are also travelling to people's home countries in order to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU's reaction is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
The EU has thrown its weight into the balance and proved its determination to act with tough sanctions and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also consider domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not used to the security apparatus regularly locking down thousands of people in the country.
Bonjour, merci.
I expect a response promptly, at the latest by early next week.
Merci pour votre soutien #NAME#.
Feu dans le transformateur: Dix mille personnes sans électricité
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no power and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had paralyzed a transformer station.
After a fire with severe damage to a transformer station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities due to the fire.
Westnetz, the supplier, reported that numerous emergency backup generators were in use on Saturday until the large-scale disruption was finally completely remedied late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers from the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered places in schools for care and called for help from neighbors.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very conscious that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the communities affected, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the primary technology department, in a press release on Saturday evening.
The repairs to the damage will take a few more days as the Western network engineers were initially only able to put some cables back into service provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
According to information from Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at around 7.15pm has caused severe damage to parts of the 10,000-volt switching system in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There expensive cleaning and repair works are necessary.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply has been restored.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m. over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9.30 p.m.
Since 11.15 p.m. those affected by the outage have had electricity again.
Over 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
After building an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for help from neighbors.
What matters now is that citizens look after their elderly or single neighbours and let the local fire departments know if help is needed, explained district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the main focus was on residents of care homes.
In addition, according to information from the authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those people who cannot take care of themselves or who depend on mains-powered medical devices or medical care.
Nordic Combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined skiers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to the podium at the world cup in Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to give way again to the outstanding Norwegian, Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had started the cross-country skiing with a large lead after the ski jump.
I took the lamp apart again.
And stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would still like to send them back
If you don't mind, I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.
Jennifer Aniston emploie une armée entière de beauté
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a mountain and valley journey.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who caused a sensation in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An army of assistants, stylists and trainers worry about their appearance.
Nevertheless, so Aniston, she allows herself a chip a day (yes, rightly read: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
It is a wonder that their hearts have fallen for both female and male fans equally.
Perhaps because she simply has bad luck with love - and is still looking for the great love.
And removed the desire for a baby from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
Cela la blessait.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
C'était vraiment blessant.
It remains to hope that success and fame will make you happy.
Someone who works in biochemistry or studies biochemistry
I am currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and I find the subject itself quite exciting and the lab does not bother me (have already done the inorganic chemistry practical).
I had of course already looked up career prospects before the study programme, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely want to study until my doctorate and beyond.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially concerning my career prospects.
On the one hand (StudyCheck etc.), one always hears about super career opportunities and the profession is totally in demand, on the other hand, one always hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
That would really interest me:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) Comment vous appelez-vous?
4) Would you do it all over again?
Many thanks for your answers!
At the moment, I am really unsure and am considering interrupting my studies in 2022 and training to become a specialist computer scientist.
Si vous avez des expériences, n'hésitez pas à les partager :)
I had sent an article back via the contact form or cancelled it and wanted to inquire whether it had arrived or been processed, since I had not yet received any confirmation.
Bonjour, j'ai commandé deux #PRS_ORG# le 12.12.19.

The title is given, I work as a vaccinating doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (up to now) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine has been used, above all in care homes.
Since these will soon be finished to a large extent, it will then go on to vaccination centres for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organisational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, is that compatible with the vaccination...").
In my field, I am responsible for providing information about the vaccination, determining who is eligible for vaccination (according to the vaccination order and without any reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care for allergic reactions (this has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often don't have any with us, but only (please don't think there's any lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, who can't (can they?) carry out any vaccinations, so that I also carry out the majority of vaccinations there myself.
Bonjour.
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in part with us.
The blue parcel number #PRS_ORG# with the delivery number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the remark "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Could you please tell me what the next step is?
Bonne semaine!

Au moins 100 morts par des tornades en Kentucky
A devastating storm system has spawned numerous tornadoes across the US.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be reported.
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
In the night to Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe damage in the USA and possibly claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms have left a trail of destruction some 320 kilometres long, mainly in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area that everything was gone wherever the tornado had swept through.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible at all.
He is expecting up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official figures are rising constantly.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one with #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to return the old one as soon as possible.
Can it not be changed or not?Write in English, I also understand that well
It's been a long time, then I would stop
Filmsuche Hilfe bitte
Bonjour chers amis,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I believe it was a film for young people.
In the film there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite certain).
As I cannot describe it any closer in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers of the Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and there is action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that he can live, I think.
The transition, I believe, is also the grave of the soldier.
Finalement, je crois que les deux soldats se battent l'un contre l'autre.
If this says something to you, I am grateful for every answer.
Obviously, the chair had a non-obvious defect at sale.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Oh, I don't have the password for the WiFi.
Must first contact my husband.
But that can take time.
Comment dois-je le faire?
I want to return it and then order it again, since it is currently on sale.
Nous le comprenons.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
Party, that we wanted to throw away": Frankfurt celebrates after scoring comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction by Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had last lost twice in a row, were apparently on the way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then SGE turned the game around, shot down their frustration from a mixed start to the season in just under an hour and won furiously with 5-2. It is crazy what the boys have achieved today, trainer Oliver Glasner jubiled at DAZN and spoke of "general praise for everyone who was involved".
This initially looked like another setback for Frankfurt, who are now ninth in the league - still behind expectations.
Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen the lead with 2-0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
As the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance, Glasner continued.
I am absolutely delighted with the performance we showed and the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his healed muscle injury, also stressed the morale of his teammates.
I think our mentality is incredible, said the 27-year-old and enjoyed the result, especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
Glasner does not want to lose focus for the upcoming tasks, but feels well-positioned with regard to personnel.
It is exceptional that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live a highly professional life.
Now one wants to "move forward step by step and remain modest" and to "master the tasks up to the turn of the year at this level".
Next up on Wednesday in the run-up to the English Week is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6.30pm, Sky).
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has been consistently further developed, which has led to the combination of the advanced modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly simulates the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X / VT40X / VT100X amps we present a brand new modelling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers deliver authenticity that is absolutely breathtaking.
These amps, too, of course, contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube amplifier.
This is partly based on real analogue circuits, because these get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier simply better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit design, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just bubble up.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level and make the amp and effects sound exactly how you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modelling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Needless to say, it has since then been refined on numerous occasions in order to satisfy new sound demands, which led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the output stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier, and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuitry of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, is perfect in recreating the behaviour, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
Problèmes de fibre optique + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fibre optic connection in the house for a couple of weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable WiFi network.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which reliably received and sent 50 Mbit apart from a few glitches.
The new fibre optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and these come to the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the WiFi, no longer receives the full 500, but the further I get away from the module in the house with the module, the less comes in (i.e. use a plug that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that with the new fibre optic connection, the Internet in the first floor is even slower than before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similar losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with glass fibre?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables in the house.
Je suis vraiment au désespoir, pourquoi j'ai ici un compte extra.
That is why I would be all the more pleased about an answer.
I am a very good customer of yours and have already completely furnished two homes with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now reliable?
Merci beaucoup
With friendly greetings
If there is no telephone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I give up again soon, because it simply does not work here.
Bonjour.
Today I received my #PRS_ORG, but I cannot stack them and thus shorten them.
Pouvez-vous m'aider encore?
Otherwise I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
J'aimerais recevoir une réponse
Is the battery broken?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20Q and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago and it should still be working.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough for operation.
Faulty display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the plugged in power supply.
I then dismantled the battery, but that didn't help either.
Vous avez des idées?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on battery power?
Est-ce que quelque chose d'autre est brisé?
Merci pour votre aide!
Oui, nous avons tous les deux refait et utilisons la version 4.5...
It could be that they have heard more often about problems
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new homes
The new Federal Housing Minister, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as has been demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
With expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes, said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left party will set up an expert committee to work out how to implement the results of the referendum.
If the situation does not improve, however, Geywitz is not ruling out talks with the FDP in the grand coalition about further tightening rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake by 2029, a cap on rental increases in strained housing markets and an extension of the rental mirror.
I will speak to the Attorney General to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not unwind despite this, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not as originally 1699€?
Counsel and ideas for further professional life
Bonne fête de Noël à vous!
My Christmas is sadly only moderately good, because my dear head is just thinking about everything that can be thought about.
Before I digress here... in short: I need advice and preferably from people who know my situation - so from you.
I'm doing the ref as a rookie.
Originally I studied something else and worked in a field related to that (to remain anonymous, I won't specify anything more).
The whole thing then became too boring for me and I started looking for alternatives that would be more fun for me.
At some point I landed in teaching and I was certain that was what I wanted - even though the conditions were much more rigid than in my previous job, but that didn't bother me.
I am now at the third "I google other job postings."
And it's only been six months.
Before the paintings, I always decided to carry on and at least finish the ref, after that I could always change my mind.
Mais je suis absolument prêt.
J'ai passé le dernier mois si peu de temps libre que je suis complètement vidé.
Now it is the holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my evening my evening.
I was free then.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in the moment.
Now the family party is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that drive me up the wall.
In principle, it's fun and viewed from the outside, the replay also runs well, which is good for the feedback and so on.
But I am completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already.
I wonder whether I want to have that for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions - or whether I should not go back to the old area, where I was valued, I was able to take the time I needed if I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but I was paid appropriately and together in a team we produced something and not as a lone fighter, which is the case most of the time now.
But then I ask myself if I will not be in the same place again in a year's time and dissatisfied.
You know, it's all kind of muddled, but maybe you've got advice or ideas as an outsider, how I get out of this situation that I'm completely finished and start crying at the smallest thought of it.
I am not going to make any decisions now; that would not lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone from me.
J'espère que ma situation est au moins un peu plus claire.
Theaterhistoriker Günther Rühle im Alter von 97 Jahren verstorben
He has profiled himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental history of the theater.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
The new book is still lying on the table, fresh off the press: "An old man gets older."
The shattering diary of a slow goodbye to the world, led by theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading the news comes that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby express my gratitude for my life."
Yes, but it was said before.
They cannot deliver from England because of #PRS_ORG#.
He has moved to a company he has mocked.
Cela ne fait pas sa situation meilleure que la tienne.
Attendre et boire du thé.
It has been a year.
After all, he did not remain in his old position and sought something else.
Vous pouvez le faire.
And that he didn't like you back then: naja egal.
He did not like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Hilfe bei erster eigener Kampagne
Bonjour!
I am currently guiding a group of four friends on the adventure Over the Grippen Pass and want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign specially written for players.
Nous jouons DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are plotted and now I'm writing the opening adventure and stumbling over my own feet in the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to transport a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
The further action will take place there.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is said to be lurking, waiting to ambush the heroes.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: persuade, act, threaten, recognise danger early on, whatever comes naturally to the players.
Strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords armed
If the hero doesn't notice, the goblins lurk in a hollow way and flank the hero, armed with bows, to the left and right of the carriage, while two stop the carriage with spears.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes all fall unconscious and are subsequently found and healed by the village schoolmaster's son, a half-elf.
The cart is of course gone.
2. If a defeat is inevitable, then this half-elf together with two of his knights steps in and helps the hero in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
Comment vous sentez-vous à propos du Deus ex Machina de solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an entry into adventure?
The group of goblins will later play a decisive role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I hadn't expected so many answers, not least because of so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely embrace many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narratives.
You can forget that, I already explained it several times yesterday!
This is a glass cabinet, and all the shelves have shattered, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is ruined
The wardrobe is in my flat and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the flat because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the wardrobe cannot be removed, because no one is allowed to enter my apartment

Friedrich nets 60th World Cup win - Nolte triumphs in two-man bob - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
I worked it out once, I'd have to notch up nine and a half wins a season and then I could make it to Cortina 2026, said the double Olympic champion from the BSC Oberbärenburg, who celebrated two wins in two days at the Winterberg races.
He fended off the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths on Saturday, moving up from third to first.
Then he changed his material setup a bit and drove out a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team, Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bau (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) beat the Brit Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded, said Friedrich, who also celebrated his 22nd win in a row.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who was driving for Stuttgart, came fifth this time, after coming second before.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after ranking fourth in the first race.
If I knew what he did differently, I would do it too, said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Among the women, Laura Nolte took her third win of the season in her home town in the two-woman bob.
After only managing fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to the world cup win on Sunday together with starter Deborah Levi.
Double Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She recorded her first podium finish of the winter alongside her Olympic qualification.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki and Leonie Fiebig took third place.
For me it was super cool, first place in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is taking me with her.
Je suis super heureux de la progression.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay," said Burghardt and stressed: "It's not just about pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a little irritated by the not entirely flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
When it's time to change your current account
Anyone who thought that now there would finally be peace with the Giro accounts, sees themselves disappointed.
While many banks used the autumn to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the thresholds for negative interest rates are falling further.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the allowance and even quartered the daily rate.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the group's savings bank subsidiary - to 50,000 euros for current accounts and investment accounts, and to 25,000 euros for day-to-day accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower fees apply to the entire German Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already previously fallen to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
Nevertheless: According to figures from the internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now offer a fee-free allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda Bank Berlin also arrived at 25,000 euros: However a legal dispute with the consumer centres is still ongoing there, and in the first instance these have even won the case before the Berlin regional court against this regulation.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly build up reserves - just in case the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates to be unallowable in principle and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Mercedes proteste après le controversé final de Formule 1
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen should have committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has appealed.
The silver arrows suspected two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he allegedly overtook illegally.
A second appeal was made against the verdict at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed correctly.
Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last round and clinched his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutch driver overtook a car in front of him.

Dämpfer für Handball-Damen vor Viertelfinale gegen Spanien
Germany's handball women slunk off the court after their defeat to Denmark, their heads hanging and their eyes empty.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection suffered a bitter defeat at 16-32 (8-13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face hosts Spain in the quarter final.
We were much too frightened and had too much respect for the opponent, judged national coach Henk Groener.
Nous devons agir différemment face à l'Espagne.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow.
That was a bad game that we have to erase," captain Emily Bölk said.
In the battle to reach the semi-finals, a clear improvement must be made against the World Cup runners-up in 2019 in the coming Tuesday, in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
We were just not there - neither in attack, nor in defence, admitted Xenia Smits, the back player, and demanded: "We must now look to the future".
Not up to scratch from top to bottom
Unlike in the previous five tournament matches, the German team was not at the level at the start.
Missed shots and technical errors in the attack and holes in the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on form and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a fast counterattack.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial ignition.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could barely make an impact - and when they did, they usually failed because of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was effectively over after 20 minutes when the score was 3-10, even though back player Mia Zschocke later saw red for a tough foul on her opponent.
She can take part in the quarter-finals again.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB selection played somewhat better and at least came to five goals by the break.
Anyway, any faint hope of catching up after the change was gone after seven minutes, with the score at 9-19.
The Greens once again sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal candidates at the finals.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to rally for better performance and went down as a clear loser.
