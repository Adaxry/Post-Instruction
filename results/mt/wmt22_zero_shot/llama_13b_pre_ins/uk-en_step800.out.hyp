Unfortunately, I must decline your proposal as I have already found a job by now.
I'm sorry, but I can't refuse there.
Sometimes it seems to me that through the translator my thoughts in Czech are different from those written by me in Ukrainian.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Good day, I agree with the course.
But could you please tell me if it's earlier?
But I don't live in Prague, there may be difficulties with transport.
If there are no alternatives, I'm okay with it.
Thank you in advance.
In Herson people came out to a rally again, Russians did not have time to disperse
As the agency was told by the participants of the event, the residents of Kherson managed to hold a rally before the military arrived to disperse it.
We managed to hold a rally. The technical equipment of the Russian Federation has arrived there now, - one of the participants of the event informed.
In the past, residents traditionally gathered for protests on Freedom Square - near the ODA and regional council buildings.
The square, like the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian forces, who are using weapons against participants in the rallies and abducting people.
As reported, on April 3 armed Russian occupants used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As reported by Ukrinform, residents of Donbass regularly carry out peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
Russian military uses force and weapons against people, there are wounded and detainees.
Russian invaders also kidnap residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded the title of "Hero City" to Herson.
On February 24, Russian President Putin began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, conducting massive artillery shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.

Helloüëãüèª I'm sick, so it would be better to postpone our meeting to the next holidays, sorry.
I like to cook, the main thing is to have a recipe, but I like to bake a cake.
In Ukraine, traditional dishes include borscht, varenyky, and others.
I don't have a favorite dish, I love to try various dishes from different countries.

I want to be occupied with something
More precisely, there is a train, but no seats
Sorry, but we're a little late.

If Nazar works from 5:30, he can use any train:
Zelensky: Mariupol - the heart of the war, stop fighting - we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battles for eastern Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war ‚Äì and if the Ukrainian army suffers defeat there, the Russians may leave negotiations and once again occupy the territories they had been ousted from.
Direct quote: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It is fighting - we are fighting, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, our positions will be weaker.
They (defenders of the city ‚Äì ed.) are people who have taken on a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the country, in (the area of) OOS, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If our situation is weak in all these directions, we may not meet.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to the return even to those cities that we have now de-occupied.
They may go for it.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and may even be uninteresting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we confirm.
We believe in our result, in our victory...".
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution, if they will be with us."
Straight talk: "People will accept the world as it is, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, on the terms of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something - and I don't think that any peace on any terms will satisfy them.
But if we speak rationally, the war must end with peace, or with millions of victims.
And even there, where a million victims, everything comes to an end of the war.
So, we have to fight - but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing else to fight for."
Hello, do you have any free places on the Czech for adults course starting at 7pm on Tuesday?

In connection with the change in the esthetic of Ukrainian literature, new concepts are needed to describe its new quality state.
The analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
The Ukrainian poetic metaphor in contemporary literature allows to analyze the postmodern context as such, where the metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion.

I am currently staying in Prague 9. I am ready to move anywhere if there is work. I will be very grateful for any advice or proposals.
But if you don't want to talk to me, I'm sad
Why did you think such an experience was not necessary for you?
Every situation is given for something.
Mostly to change a person, especially spiritually.
I will transfer these funds to you as soon as the bank approves it.

The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine disclosed the list of Russian servicemen who participated in committing military crimes in the city of Bucha, Kyiv region.
As reported by Ukrinform, this was announced by the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on Facebook.
Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine received a list of military personnel of the 64th separate motorized rifle brigade, who directly participated in committing military crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha," the report says.
According to the GUR MOU, all war criminals will be brought to justice for committing crimes against the civilian population of Ukraine.
The list can be viewed by following the link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and the entire Kiev region were liberated from Russian invaders.
In the liberated cities and villages, mass killings of civilians by Russian military have been recorded.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoly Fedoruk reported that 280 people were buried in the fraternal graves.
General Prosecutor Iryna Venediktova stated that on April 3, 410 bodies of peaceful civilians killed by the Russians were transported from the liberated territory of the Kyiv region.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the start of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian invaders' troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas in Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, multiple rocket launchers, ballistic missiles, and aviation bombs.

I thought it would be a week, but the situation is heating up, sirens constantly
Tomorrow there may be bad connection on the road.
I am grateful to every person for the experience, even if it is painful.
I think that I have learnt from each situation so as not to repeat mistakes in the future.
Directives are introduced in the form of numbered written amendments, which are part of this Regulation.
I am confident that this problem will be solved.

the place, day and time will be specified according to the interests and capabilities
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It was great, I have money for two months of rent, the district of Olomouc is not important, I will be very grateful.
Most of my friends are deeply shocked by the news of the savage abuse of the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photographs of tortured and shot people horrified the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how it was possible in the 21st century?! How?!
As for me, I was not surprised at all. Just what I had feared was happening...
I evacuated children and elderly parents from Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then he went to his colleagues with children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014 I have been helping the Ukrainian army and not for a moment did I doubt that in the event of the occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv my family would not be spared.
But I am and remain absolutely convinced that the essence of the rotten Communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terrorism, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terrorism.
In 1937, one of my grandfathers was shot in a prison in the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago in the Zhytomyr SBU they gave a copy of the grandfather's shooting case: the whole case is more than a hundred pages, but the verdict is very simple and even more terrible.
The defendant was illiterate and denied guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was a free man, poor "one-horse" nobility, never serfs.
The fact that they lived in the village and had several cows was enough to sentence the peasant and the child's caretaker to death.
The relatives did not even learn about the place of burial.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken away from the village and that all but two of them were killed, who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case there is the name of the striker Sharij.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and am not surprised that his relative was an informer for the KGB.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, as they say...
The firing squad that sentenced peasants to death were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his grandfather, he was interested in various information resources.
Russia has wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources such as the "Immortal Barrack" that qualitatively remind about the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVD found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalinist repressions and publicly wrote the names of the murderers - the system first discredited and then destroyed them.
As if on a computer they found files with child pornography, put him in jail, and he died there soon.
The KGB kills those who try to find out the truth about crimes of the past century.
What's so surprising about their actions now?!
The most vile features of human nature are concentrated there.
Above the thousand-year-old tradition of the Golden Horde, slavery and imperial racism of the 16th-19th centuries were imposed.
And then, on top of that, they conducted a diabolical genetic experiment, slashing the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Take a look at the half-French film "Checkist" from 1992, and that's how it was.
So you saw my photos in the swimming pool
Can you ask your wife what I can buy for a cold?
I'm sorry, but I don't have anyone to ask.
I also wanted to ask if you know where the children went, because Galya cannot recognize them
Lyubosh, Igor asks if it is convenient for you to go tomorrow? (he is off and can go, because they have not looked at the car today at the station).
It is very inconvenient for you to worry us so much.
You really help us, thank you!

What do the girls do when they return from school?
We came to the place where we were settled from the center in Pardubice, the conditions are good.
But there were a lot of men here drinking alcohol and smoking in the room, loud music just minimal that "disturbed", the smell of cigarettes drunk guys and we with children ... it's terrible to sleep here, honestly.
Please help with housing, for money.
But where it will be safe and not smoked.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is so strong that they must be smoking right here.
I very much ask you, one of them is hardly standing on his feet, shouting, something displeases him. It's very scary.
I just ask if you can helpüôèüèº

What can you tell me about the main entrance?
I wanted to take a look at the cake for Carina
I forgot to write to you, sorry.
Yesterday everything went very well.
We talked about children with special needs and the system of their education in Ukraine.
When Ms Shakhova introduced me as an Fpoint employee, the first question was how we found the dog, how we found the mop.
Everyone is following the page on Facebook.
They asked to convey their greetings and say how interesting it is for them to read the news.
We also talked about people of Roma nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if the child comes and the parents don't understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them in the telephone mode.
I need to change the bed linen, 2 sets.
I am happy to do it on holidays.
I have free time, and we only go to Easter services.
Thank you. Today I will write my data for work

Thus, Nestor has only a sniff, while Galinka has a temperature of 37.7 in the evening and 38
General Chapek is standing in line there very slowly.
Everyone has a chance.
The main thing is that love is real and mutual.
I don't know how it is in Europe, but in our country people get married for various reasons, mostly it is mercenary, mercantile goals.
And for me the problem is that if I don't love the person, nothing will work.
So, we took her home and took her straight away.
She was so grateful, she was crying.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said if it was possible, there would be an old blanket and pillow.
But this is not obligatory. Only if you want. I am also very grateful to you.
I am very sorry for him.
They killed my best friend in front of me.
I had a lot of questions for God about why situations kept arising in my life that just made me lose faith in everything.
Do small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.
I simply decided to go and you made a collection
It's like that, but we're not orientated in the area and we don't know where everything is.We went to the supermarket an hour ago and came back on foot.Two blankets are not suitable, so two large ones are needed
Even now, I thought about you, and you wrote to me.
Can your dad speak Russian or anyone else in the family?
It is possible that the children came to Vali and played in the hall
Ok, let's risk it then :)
I am also glad to have met you
I talked to Vladimir about accommodation, and he said that I could stay with him, or that I could look for a place myself, or that I could go to the museum metro station, where there is an institution that helps to find accommodation.
For a small thing, I'd jump over the barrier.
I don't know the answers to some of their questions
It was good on Thursday, if possible
I can't call the doctor because I haven't done the food license examination yet.
But I can't call him because I've run out of money.
I cannot recharge my phone because I do not understand Czech online banking and I cannot recharge from a Ukrainian bank card.
In the Vodafone application, I cannot change the tariff so that I have normal calls and internet.
I am already losing my mind
If the price is not right, but the face... The title sounds wrong, what did you mean?
I am ashamed to sit without work
Just wrote that in school at the lesson
I'm sorry to have bothered you, I was just very upset
But that's closer to when they'll leave Ukraine to know for sure what they'll eat.
But now all life is under question.
Yes, it is 10-11 years old. But our sizes do not match. Everything needs to be measured
I am looking for everything for the house and for the child.
Thank you that you accepted me the way I am. They always ask me if I need a shave, and I am ashamed to say that I ask myself.
I just came home and now I'm having breakfast :)
Don't explain anything, be so kind, do what you want
It is impossible to answer without a sent resume
I can't tell my mum that)
And right now I feel a little uncomfortable that I couldn't hold back my emotions before we left the apartment... Like tonight...
God bless you, Yura. Maybe I'll fall asleep right away, take a little nap.
I will write to you in any case.
Hello. Suzana helped me. I received my payment for March. I cannot understand why such a sum was credited to me alone or to both of us with Yulia.

Flowers were blooming. Everything was normal. All the rested and very beautiful.
As reported by "European Truth," Welt writes with reference to sources in government circles in Ukraine.
According to the publication, the relevant proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economics on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including training kits and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As also offered are howitzers in the version for the BTR Boxer for 120 million euros.
While tanks have to get relatively close to their targets in combat, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at distances of more than 30 kilometres.
As reported by Ukrainian government circles with reference to the KMW proposal, the delivery of self-propelled howitzers will take place according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will deliver 100 of its guns to Kiev in the shortest possible timeframe, and the gaps that have emerged will then be filled by industry in the second phase.
The first new howitzers could be delivered 30 months after signing the contract, i.e. earlier than the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed until 2027.
And this is just the first half of the day, or the second half of the day together?
Thank you, we will find a way to replenish our ranks and come back. I will write to you. Thank you.
I am going to work tomorrow without passing the commission, and then when my doctor recovers, will I pass the commission honestly?
How can I change my T-Mobile tariff package for 4 gigabytes for 249 crowns?

Loyally, they go to school, like Galya and Svyatoslav, who study remotely, finish school in Ukraine, and receive diplomas in the fall. They need to enter universities.
How to get to the city center?
Share your thoughts with me.
For me, marriage is a mystery between two people who do not discuss one another with their relatives or friends.
The man and the woman themselves decide the questions in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we are there.
Why not try this way
I rented a car for 9 people, we will come with Mariana and your family.

No. We'll wait until tomorrow. I didn't know that even big stores would be closed.
Golubtsi are prepared like this: in a saucepan, dilute the tomato paste with 0.5 liters of water 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste - to boil.
I pour the stuffing into a saucepan and pour the sauce over it.

From Monday 4.
4. In 2022, refugees from the war in Ukraine may apply for humanitarian aid at their new place of work at the Prague market.
The office in room 29 is designed specifically to accept and process applications for assistance, which is why there is an interpreter there.
Lidia has already started school, but due to illness, we will go to the teacher on Tuesday, I told her today.
I'm sitting, holding headphones on my ears, listening to music and thinking about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
To make you happy.
I don't know, honey, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I approach it in such a way that we are together. That we are a couple.
I would say that after the war, there will be a lot of work.
So I'm not afraid that I won't find her there.
I know a lot.
Therefore, I am not afraid that I did not get into any of them.
But I don't know how it will be with the housing.üò¢üò¢
I need to undergo an inspection for a food license. Can you help me with that?
Could you please prepare the apartment for 5 guests tomorrow?
What place do I take in the room with the TV?
Unlatch and upholster a sofa?
May we stop here while Ms. Margarita finds us a place to live?
don't worry about it
Not new, which was already used, but it works, but it is not necessary.
Write the address in Czech, look at the map where it is from us
I don't know how much space there is there, so I can't plan anything with furniture. I want to see that apartment at last this week and then understand what furniture I need
I'm sorry, it took so long to respond, it was a working day, and it was hard to adapt
Is this enough?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, to have that chance to hold you.
Kissing you in the morning, saying how you look.
For the child there is already a bed and a washbasin, things have been found for the first time
Don't forget that you promised to help me when you'll be able to, but not to give up ü§´üòüüôÉ
I want to do a haircut that is called a bob
Oleg was ill - he had a fever and a cough. It's better if you don't bring Jan to us, so he doesn't get infected
I'll be a little later - around 8. Is that okay?
I don't want to misunderstand you
But I hope that everything will be fine!
But we didn't even talk about this!
I understand how important it is for you!
As for me, I'm silent (for me it's just a peak that can't be reached)!
How do you feel today? After the celebration?
hello, sorry, I just woke up, I didn't sleep well
Excuse me for disturbing you.
I was upset that we didn't do a good job translating the test with Kolya yesterday.
I will ask either Grigory Denisenko or Yonashenko to help me with the mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be useful to them?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to brush up on mathematical terms over the weekend.
Geometry in general is difficult, but we have to work with Cole so that there are no mistakes.
Thank you for the test tasks
We also hope for this very much
And so she is very happy with any present
I wanted to connect my Czech number to the Internet
Yesterday I met a Ukrainian woman, Victoria, on the 402 bus stop.
This girl - a child, but here she is... her eyes full of tears and pain...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed to be friends.
And yesterday evening, thanking God for this girl, because it's the first person from Ukraine who felt my heart reciprocity.
The office in room 29 is specially designated to accept and process applications for assistance
it turned out that I ordered a backup card
I'm just a simple person
So she wouldn't be scared that no one came
I didn't go. I cooked it myself. I can do it! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the gas.
So you are leaving the city for a long time?
A year ago, in the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we commemorated the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babyn Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke about "the common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation - it is also part of our responsibility for our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes, then for us Germans there can only be one answer: never again!
The fight must continue."
Today Russia is attacking a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of peaceful citizens, starving the inhabitants of the blockaded cities and letting them die of diseases.
Russian troops are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, which even visually resemble the shootings in Babyn Yar.
For more than a month, Germans have seen this in the news in real time.
Thus, Germany is implementing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, and also weapons, which was unimaginable not long ago.
Germany delays delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only fighting against the swastika.
This means fighting with all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop atrocities that are happening in Ukraine.
One song for you
We agree, let's arrange an excursion and write when to meet
All of them were sick, but Lidia was not sick in them there was a new type of flu
Then I'll do it tomorrow
I use this instead of a card
Ring for late documents.
The ticket cost me 2000 hryvnias
Sergei Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO is no longer a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of those surveyed were "for".
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the start of the war in Donbass, the number of opponents of NATO began to fall, while supporters, on the contrary, began to grow.
After the start of full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - more than 75%.
Despite the support of Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO is providing in wartime conditions, there is a lot of criticism of the Alliance and its members - for the late delivery of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, unwillingness to "irritate" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to refuse the desire to join the Alliance due to the position of Russia, if this can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In a new episode of the "Cursed Questions" podcast, together with the editor of "European Truth" we will talk about how the Alliance has been helping Ukraine since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticized for, what the Alliance is criticized for in vain, why our prospects of membership in NATO are closer than ever in history, and what security guarantees discussed at the negotiations with Russia could become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is going on here
My Volt partner noted that my statement was under consideration.
I sent it through this mobile application
There is no visa, we have to go to the congress center and find out how to do it, because it was issued in Poland, they did not give a visa, but gave a stamp.
We will definitely write to you!
Denis went out today in a good mood.
Agreed with the boy from Ukraine, whom I met yesterday, to meet near the school so he could show me everything.
So, I hope everything is fine with him
But I don't like it, I'm not enough for a long time
It is reported in Ukraine that the Czech Republic has sent tanks T-72 and combat vehicles to Ukraine
I'm leaving the children there and going home because I can't stay any longer.
And to take with you at 6-7 a.m.
So, it was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this person, but he didn't behave properly and I left him.
After some time, he returned and apologized to me.
I said no to him.
Then after some time he called and said that they had operated on his heart.
Asking him to just chat with me, I regretted it.
I psychologically supported him almost half a year.
We talked a lot during this time.
At the same time, I had problems at work.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I thought, maybe it's really necessary to look at him differently.
And he proposed to me to get married, and two days later he died.
So God himself decided our fate.
What does being ready for marriage mean to you?
And he only speaks Czech
I wanted to say that I managed to find a place to live and I'm very happy about it üôÇ I now have a place to live and be with my child.

Well, let's talk about something else, because I can't sleep anyway, and I keep dreaming that they are bombing...
God is never late, everything has its time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I perfectly understand the value of unqualified work and understand that I will not be able to have such a job as I had in Kyiv here and that the money I earned in Kyiv I will not earn here now.
But I can't just sit there and do nothing, because then any bad thoughts come into my head, so I have to occupy myself with some physical activity.
Documents are issued at the airport from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., otherwise you can just wait.

Could you be so kind as to say, please, if you have an approximate schedule of cleaning the apartment for the month ahead, even if it's just for an approximate understanding of which days?
I don't remember this schedule at all )
Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kyiv: "They haven't done this before"
Straight talk from Konashenkov: "We see attempts at diversions and attacks by the Ukrainian army on targets in the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian Armed Forces will deliver strikes against decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, which the Russian army had previously withheld from."
Russia launched missile attacks on Kyiv from the first days of the full-scale invasion of Russian troops in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles, which were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system, fell on a multi-apartment building in the capital's Poznyaki.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a multi-storey building on Valeriy Lobanovskiy Avenue.
On March 1, Russians hit a telecommunications tower near Babyn Yar, killing five passersby.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building over the South Railway Station.
On March 14, the debris of the missile launched by the occupants destroyed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential area in Vynogradar, killing one person and wounding 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center on Vynogradar, as a result of which at least 4 people were killed.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko once again stated on April 13 that residents of the capital, who evacuated the city, should not return yet.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians could still launch missile attacks on Kyiv, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, near Belgorod in Russia, an oil depot exploded, apparently as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, local authorities in Belgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian shell" had fallen near the city.
Obviously, the elites in Washington and Berlin are throwing cold water on the idea that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers over Ukraine.
But Zelensky is speaking more to their voters and to society as a whole.
With his speeches in parliaments and before tens of thousands of people in the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces European nations, which elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this eloquent mixture of strength, tenderness and sometimes despair, gradually reach their goal.
While Joe Biden is categorically against closing the border, 70% of his fellow citizens support this idea.
Although Paris and Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine's entry, the process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want you to think we are crooks.
Give the money you gather to those who need it more.
I can come to you and we can sort it out there and then. I always want to help

You call your job to find out if you have to go to work today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
While something becomes clear.
There is hope... it won't last long.
Now ... to arrange ... something will be.
Mozog refuses to accept...
Where to go? I have no one and nowhere to go.
I had $50 in my pocket. All we had spent at home.
Many people have bosses who haven't paid them for their work.
Where should I go? Who needs me? How do I provide for my children? Where should I live?
You can't take many things.
You didn't take anything with you... you're going 1000 kilometers.
You don't know if you will feed them tomorrow, or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children around all of Prague.
What next? No-one knows. How much? No-one knows. Children are asking for sweets. And you can't give them any. It's too expensive for you.
And from each of them - we don't have any.
Our choice is either to stay there and bring children into danger or try to save ourselves here

These are gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are communal workers who, under fire, remove rubbish, repair water pipes and electricity lines to ensure people have what they need.
These are doctors and nurses who work 24 hours a day to save people, without complaining, and in their free time they volunteer, collecting first aid kits for the front.

Is it acceptable for my daughter to be 8 years old?
I am looking for accommodation for us with our daughter for 3-4 days to come to the Czech Republic and submit passports for visa to Canada.
In Warsaw, there are a lot of people in the visa center and the online queue does not work.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far, it takes a lot of time by train, it will be difficult for the child.
Therefore, she decided to look for an apartment in Prague or near it.
No, we are fine

The Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (ZVU) is an electoral district that unites polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine, and consists of premises for voting at Ukrainian embassies and consulates as well as premises at foreign military bases where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents are stationed (Kosovo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo).[1] The role of the district electoral commission for the Foreign Electoral District is performed by the Central Election Commission.
In the overseas electoral district there are only national elections: the presidential election and the election of people's deputies and all-Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections are not held in ZVO.

Andriy Yermak, the head of the Office of the President, said that Russia is starting a "fake operation" regarding the weapons we receive from our allies.
Straight talk from Yermak: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their own backwardness and are trying to 'screw' the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the latest hoaxes - supposedly the destruction of the S-300 air defense systems transferred by Slovakia.
Premier Eduard Heger has already denied this information.
What's next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. One of them is called.
They may start spreading fakes that Ukrainian soldiers are allegedly surrendering with weapons to the allies, and the weapons are being transferred to the Russian army in large quantities.
I want to warn about such fake news.
But the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to the other world.

The international community has continued to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged of Russian forces committing atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, with Moscow dismissing the reports as "provocation."
The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, stated the following to journalists in Wellington on April 4: ‚ÄúThe message about Russian troops killing, raping, and seriously wounding peaceful civilians in Ukraine is one that deserves condemnation.‚Äù
Russia must answer for what it has done before the world, she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The statements came after reports that hundreds of unarmed civilians had been shot and thrown into mass graves or left lying in the streets in the suburb of Kiev, Bucha, by Russian forces who had occupied the area for several weeks.
Photos purporting to show the bodies of civilian men with their hands tied behind their backs shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed "war crimes" in Bucha.
What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear actions, Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
We will do all we can so that those who committed these war crimes will not remain unpunished, said Sanchez in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a "provocation."
Without any evidence, she stated that the United States and NATO "ordered" the image to discredit Russia.
In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not cause any doubts about who "ordered" this story," Zaharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defense also stated that the picture of Buƒç is "yet another provocation by the Kyiv regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow called on the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called "provocation by Ukrainian radicals" in Bucha.
The Russian Investigative Committee released a statement on April 4 announcing an "investigation" into Ukraine's alleged distribution of "knowingly false information" on Russian military actions in Buƒça.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on April 3 accused Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are implemented, said Zelensky in a video address, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is joint responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For the shots in the head," he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand," he said of the scenes of victims scattered in the streets of Buzhanka, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty saw bodies, which appeared to be civilian, in the streets of a small town.
Only in one place the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies in the street.
Journalists from AP saw bodies of at least 21 people in different locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people - all in civilian clothes - were scattered on the ground near a place that local residents say was used by Russian forces as a base.
It appears the victims were killed at close range.
Ukrainian authorities say the bodies of at least 410 civilians have been found in the Kyiv region, which had been controlled by Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
They were told: "Kyiv does not exist". How occupiers used to deport Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
There is one more point in this list for which there is significantly less information at the moment - the evacuation of local population to the territory of the enemy.
Starting from mid-March, the Russian occupants have been "evacuating" the inhabitants of the occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed president Lukashenko has effectively turned into a Russian military polygon.
Ukrainian Truth found the expelled Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the evacuation was taking place and whether there were ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to voluntary-forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were forcibly deported to Russia and Belarus.
In Melitopol the Russians abducted the staff of the second maternity hospital, took away the children without their parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the late Ukrainian swimming champion Yosyp Zhabotinsky.
Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander has just got a job at the "Antonov" airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled in the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
Like true scouts, Denis and Marina had packed their bags, but on the morning of the 24th they didn't have time to evacuate.
They had no car, and the suburban buses were already full.
Around noon on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit the neighboring house.
Then the family descended into the basement and stayed there for three long weeks, until March 17, when Russian troops evacuated them to Belarus.
A total of about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
At 6 p.m. on February 24, people came into the courtyard who spoke and did not speak Russian or Ukrainian.
They ask: "Is there anyone?" - I say there is. - "Come out!"
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there was a weapon.
All men were questioned whether they served in the army.
Women were told: "We have come to protect you at the instruction of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was a Chechen OMON, even not a military, young boys years of 25-35.
They said: "We were helped by Ukrainians in the war, Sashko Bilyj (led the UNA-UNSO "Viking" unit that fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), and now we have come to help you."
On the third day they asked what we lacked.
We said that the water was a big problem.
They broke into the shop, stole the goods and brought us six bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
That's what they did after looting the store and said: "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need the video for Ramzan Kadyrov."
Nobody wanted to say anything, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child said there: "You have seven days to give us our phones back" - they laughed.
And they constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said it was great that they had come, because they didn't want the war, and supported Ukraine: "Putin is a thug, as is Kadyrov, but we can't do anything, because our families are there."
And in general, they did not fight, but robbed stores, looted.
They tied a Georgian ribbon to one leg and a white scarf to the other and called her "a volunteer."
They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten at Bucha, they asked us: "Do you have any artillery?"
Moreover, we had formed ranks ‚Äì the Chechens did not know one another, and in the first few days they asked for passwords to find out who was friend and who was foe.
They were with us until March 13, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk airborne troops.
They placed 30-40 units of equipment between the buildings - we constantly fell into it from "Bayraktars".
But they came and told us that the Ukrainian army no longer exists, but there is "Azov," and, according to their words, "Azov" has thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been pushed since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian - either a naval officer or an FSB representative - came to us and said there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio - they were talking about Bucha, Gostomel, and we thought they might give us the "green corridor" too.
We passed our list to the Chechens from the very beginning, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they tell us: "You're being taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We are saying that we do not want to go there or there.
To which they replied: "You're damaging your children's psyches!"
How it worked: they lured us into the basement and started shooting from under the house - either with "Grad" rockets, or with mortars.
And then it came back... The neighboring houses simply burned down, some of them collapsed.
In our house there was a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some didn't go, saying that this was for traitors of the motherland - in other words, "they'll shoot you there and sell your organs".
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burnt houses, broken equipment, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians were immediately taking away the equipment.
A lot of Cossacks, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed an improvised control, many were without documents, because they had burned.
They placed us in the tents of the Red Cross and gave us tea.
And here we can hear the shots! A rocket was fired, and we can see the trail ‚Äì it was an ‚ÄúIskander‚Äù that hit Kiev.
Though these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, the planes are flying, turning on the border."
But we are aviators, we have an education, we understand that.
Then we got into a bus and were taken to the "Chonki" sanatorium near Gomel.
His boss, Vengher Vasyl Stepanovich, says: "Here I am, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves are brought to justice.
Poor people suffer!
And we have Lukashenko!
As he said, so it will be."
They offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "And you are traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN (at least that's what they were called) were spreading disinformation that men could not go to Poland.
Many believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to go anyway, even though we had a problem with documents - our daughter didn't have a foreign passport.
We had it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
In the Ukrainian consulate they didn't help us at all, and at the station in Minsk they said that without passports nobody would take us in the bus.
I would like to say that Belarusian volunteers really helped us.
We were settled in Minsk and accompanied.
In the sanatorium they did not hold back.
Our second group's migration representative said that you can stay here maximum one and a half week, because Belarus is not Europe and there are no payments here at all.
We found an internal carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
Driving by Mozir (some 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border ‚Äì UPI), we saw the launch of ballistic missiles on Ukraine: the missile first flies, beautifully lights up, and then fades.
People who got on the bus in Mozirye said that the Russians were constantly shooting from the polygons.
But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are being released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something of her son's if he was called up.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, does not believe at all.
They say: "You lie, we are a peaceful nation."
They do not understand that their polygons are used to shoot at Ukraine.
In Poland we waited for friends who took us to Estonia.
Now we are registering, deciding what we will do next.
In Estonia, there are probably as many Ukrainian flags as Estonian ones."
Marina lived in the territory of the military town in Gostomel together with her brother's family ‚Äì his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to gather the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to sleep in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself was unable to return home and will not be able to ‚Äì her house no longer exists.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.
And will you not be able to come to the center on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. And we are always waiting for you!
Thank you for the agreement, the motifs are beautiful

Can we agree on how to do this better?
On April 1st, the mayor of Bucha Anatoly Fedoruk announced a joyful news ‚Äì Ukrainian military had liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31st.
The next day the occupiers were driven out of the entire Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians would have felt at that moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in just one place, Bucha, Russians killed at least 280 peaceful residents.
They were killed just on the street, some had their hands tied and were shot in the head, some were teenagers.
The village head of Motyzhyn, Olga Sukhanko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were abducted on 23 March, were found dead, with signs of torture.
Olga and Alexander's bodies were in a mass grave, while Igor's was in the sewer.
Beside the road, 20 km from Kyiv, the bodies of several naked women wrapped in blankets were discovered.
The Russians tried to burn them.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European Truth".
All equipment, all that they have already sent, for some types of equipment, this is done too late.
So, when we're talking about, for example, Mariupol, and you're losing thousands of people, what now?
I see 100 percent support from leaders of some countries, which is really great.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
Asked whether Ukraine has enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "No, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not have happened, or it would have looked different.
It would have unfolded differently, we would have had the support of our close neighbors, and we could have fought together.
But confident that there would have been no war," he added.
We recall that the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armoured vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

We've been hiding the war from the in-laws for a whole month.
So far, so good.
However, in Plymka (cat ‚Äì UP), fur loss on the back and hind legs may be due to stress, diet change and vitamin deficiency.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but the stress from me does not depend, unfortunately.
Unlike the bride, the spot is not deaf, it hears the sirens and explosions."
Thanks to the fact that Olga can't hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her niece lived with her "incognito" for a month.
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova picked up a weapon for the first time in her life.
I, as a partisan, lived with her in the apartment for 33 days.
They hid from me the war and that I was nearby - I came as always for a few hours.
But when her friend started talking, I handed her the receiver - she listened for four hours, then sang for two hours."
The radio was always by the bed.
Most of the time the mother-in-law spends in her room.
I could hear her breathing, which allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her heels, I hid in my room.
First of all, she hid the receiver and the TV.
Then she called everyone who communicates with her. This is 6-7 people.
I asked her to talk about anything but the war.
I asked my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end

A British man who fought in the ranks of the Ukrainian army to defend Mariupol says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, a serviceman of the brigade of marines of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is defending Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: twitter page of Eidin Aislin, a Briton who has served in the ranks of the Ukrainian army since 2018, VVs with reference to family and friends of Aislin, Atlas News with reference to the words of Aislin's friend who talked to him
A literal translation of Aslina's twitter: "We received a message from him: "We tried everything possible to protect Mariupol for 48 days, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian army.
We have not run out of food and ammunition.
Thank you all, I hope the war will end soon."
Details: Eyslin served in the 36th separate brigade of marines of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which takes part in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
BBC journalists spoke to the soldier's mother, Eunice Wood, who confirmed her son had told her by phone that they were planning to surrender.
Military friend Brendan Phillips also confirmed to reporters that in their last phone conversation, Aslin spoke of their unit's plans to surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists from the publication Atlas News contacted his friend who said that the Aislin battalion intends to surrender to Russian forces so as not to fall into the hands of the so-called "Kadyrovtsy" without weapons and ammunition.
The audio recording of the telephone conversation, in which Aslin allegedly speaks with his American friend, who plans to visit Ukraine, was also distributed in social media.
In the conversation with Eislin, he said that they were trying to escape the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Previously, the Briton said that in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company "Wagner".
Easlin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to Syria to fight against terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State."
In 2018 he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took the oath.
His friends and relatives called him Johnny, but he was better known on social media under the nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard. But I also want to know. Are we together or not?

The attackers - Bolsheviks - avenged their losses in the battle.
Teacher Dmitry Pavlytsky, his unknown relative, and teenager Boris Alekseienko were shot.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep pit, which was covered with earth."
According to the recollections, "there was some kind of dead silence in the city."
Rarely, someone from the residents walked from house to house.
The bodies of those killed by the Bolsheviks were constantly being found in the streets

Very interesting tradition, we do the same on Christmas
Last week the Verkhovna Rada adopted bill 7176, which has the name "On the monitoring of potential threats to national security of Ukraine in the field of economy".
It is strange that in essence the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere has turned out to be... the place where members of the supervisory boards of state companies and state banks hold their meetings.
The initiators of the bill consider that the adoption of decisions by the supervisory board of the state company in virtual Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We know about a large number of new dangers for state companies, but we do not know of any company that needs to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the address of its location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear - it's a great foundation for dismantling all the gains of the state enterprise reform after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then returning to direct management.
Such as it was before 2015.
Why do state companies need supervisory boards and who should be on them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill is passed under the guise of patriotism, then tomorrow others may be passed as well ‚Äì for example, the system of public procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
A lot can be blamed on the war.
Incidentally, this initiative emerged even before the start of the war and bill 7176.
On February 22, this norm was also added to the comparative table of draft law 5397.
And in general, the desire to get rid of supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some popularly elected officials for a long time.
Not in order to criticise it as such, but to show the possible consequences of the bill, let us examine the arguments, on the basis of which it was deemed necessary to adopt it.
And then we will make our proposals on how to manage state enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would make remote work by supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk lies in the fact that the supervisory board will not be able to take the necessary decisions, which may paralyze the work of the company.
We agree that such a risk exists, but will it be possible to prevent the transfer of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a pretty cynical situation where independent members of the supervisory board (who make up the majority of the board) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be released.
And this will inevitably lead to the loss of a quorum, necessary for the supervisory board to take any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the necessity of conducting a competitive selection, which usually takes 3-4 months.
Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the proposed bill 7176 will be able to prevent the loss of the possibility for the supervisory board to take decisions, but rather lead to this!
People's Deputy and author of the bill Dmytro Natalukha gives other arguments in favor of the bill.
For example, he points out that "many companies, including the defence industrial complex (OPI), now require relocation" and that "it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information with Zoom from Vienna".
To begin with, practically all state-owned enterprises in the OPK sector in Ukraine have supervisory boards.
The supervisory board exists only in Ukroboronprom, which in essence manages almost all state enterprises of the OPK.
But even in Ukroboronprom, according to the law, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a voluntary basis.
All the power in the "Ukroboronprom" belongs to the general director, who, by the way, will take a decision on the necessity of relocating this or that enterprise of the OPK, which is part of the holding.
In addition, such an argument does not withstand criticism because bill 7176 does not introduce any changes at all to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises in the OPK sector.
Mr. Dmitro also posted an emotional argument on his Facebook page.
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of state companies and banks, but let's try to unravel some of them: "Serious foreign experts leave Ukraine in 2021 at the first mention of the word "war", but remain members of supervisory boards in state enterprises in Ukraine and receive salaries of several hundred thousand hryvnias".
Firstly, this is manipulation ‚Äì most of these members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only come here periodically.
Therefore, to say that they "leave Ukraine" is, to put it mildly, unfair.
In addition, as a result of the pandemic, foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been widespread in world practice, in absolutely different spheres: business, education, medicine, etc.
It should also be remembered that membership of the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have another job and the means of electronic communication helps them in this.
Third, all these statements read as claims against only foreigners.
It is interesting that Mr. Dmitro does not express similar claims against members of supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
Because they also do not know where their companies are located.
To put it mildly, this is far from the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and war - this is just a new convenient occasion.

In the Brovary, Vyshgorod and Bucha districts of the Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, a strengthened curfew will be introduced for 2 days.
Pavluk's direct quote: "In populated areas of the B—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ä—Å—å–∫–æ–≥–æ, –í–∏—à–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—Å—å–∫–æ–≥–æ and –ë—É—á–∞–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ–≥–æ districts, which were under Russian occupation and liberated by Ukrainian forces, the curfew is strengthened!
The restrictions will be in place in these cities and villages from 9 p.m. on April 2 to 6 a.m. on April 5."
Details: According to the head of the regional VA, at the moment it is absolutely forbidden to stay on the streets of populated areas and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during the alarm signal to take refuge.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clean and demine the territories.
Omelianuk called on people who have left these areas to stay away from returning home for now.
On the rest of the territory of Kyiv region the curfew will last daily from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.

Serbia's defense budget has been growing in geometric progression for several years.
Over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the renewal of military technology and the purchase of modern systems, rising 22 places in the list of the world's strongest military powers.
After the full-scale aggression of Russia against Ukraine, the Western countries have taken the warning of a possible deterioration in the Balkans quite seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

Law enforcement officers of the regime of Lukashenka detained three Belarusians, aged 27 and 28, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signaling system near Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Liberty", human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state information agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that three residents of Bobruisk were detained and one was wounded in the night of March 30 with the support of special forces "SOBR".
According to "Vyasni", the men resisted arrest and attempted to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of those detained was wounded and is being treated in a medical facility.
Another was given medical assistance at the scene.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, stated that "acts of terrorism on the railways of Belarus will be stopped harshly" by the use of weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of "BZD" and the administrator of thematic resources "BZD" in "VKontakte" and "Odnoklassniki" Valentin Samasiuke.
Where he is now and in what condition is unknown, @belzhd_live reports.
At the end of March in Belarus, not less than 40 railway workers were detained for diversions.
Reminder: the formation of BYpol, which was declared extremist by the regime of Lukashenko, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out diversions on objects of railway transport and infrastructure in Belarus as part of the "Peramog" plan.
Belarusian "railway partisans" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As is known, through Belarus, Russia is transferring troops to fight in Ukraine.

US bans investment in Russia and imposes sanctions on Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is introducing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest banks in Russia, Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investment in Russia.
This is reported on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, while Alfa Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets in the US financial system and ban US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the US will introduce a full ban on new investment in Russia.
To this end, US President Joe Biden has signed a new decree, which includes a ban on new investment in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
This step is based on the decision made by more than 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The release of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers, such as legal and consulting firms," the White House statement said.
The third step of new sanctions from the USA were restrictions against major Russian state companies in the critical sector.
This would prohibit US citizens from conducting operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the United States.
The Ministry of Finance will publish a detailed list the next day on Thursday.
And finally, the last part of the package is full blocking of assets of Putin's adult children, his wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including ex-president and prime minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and prime minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions cut them off from the US financial system and freeze all their assets in the United States.

All is well.

I clean every week
Unfortunately, I do not have a program, but I will try to figure it out.
I dreamed of being a teacher
My girls can't move anywhere now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask if you could let me know if you hear anything about housing.
I would be happy to rent a flat with a decent girl.
If you know, let me know.
On the other hand - no comment.
Thank you in advance.
You didn't write to me another person Natasha, 54 years old. Write the exact address and how much the courses cost
I think it's better for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I didn't change my last name, it's been with me since birth.
Good day, Mr. Reyarde! I'm sorry, I didn't see. I will do it right now and send it to you immediately.
We are going to the medical commission now

We'll do it somehow.
But how it will be paid for, please, no credits.
Write me directly, and I will help.
We are your partner, or I am not your partner.
I don't even know.
What should I take with me?
Not my day today. The blinds in the living room broke. In the morning. Another one tonight.
I don't see anything from you
I am also very sad
I'll remind you about the texture later
Do you only speak Russian with your dad?
What day does your colleague want to clean the house and how many windows does the house have?
I am ashamed to distract you from your affairs
Good evening, I can't not share with you. There's news from Mariupol about the son - he's alive and in shape.
It's great to read Joe Dispenza, he does scientific research on the impact of external factors and the formation of new neural connections
On the morning of April 12, the journalist of the "1+1" TV channel Natalia Nagrin published a video recording, which was transferred to her by the military of the 36th brigade of marines from Mariupol.
In it, the military say they have no weapons to fight with and a mountain of wounded.
They said that "the bill is by the hour."
Previously, on April 11, the 36th separate brigade of marines, which is defending Mariupol, addressed Ukrainians in Russian.
According to the statement, April 11 may be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command has not been in contact with the fighters for two weeks.
On social media, there were expressions of skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny assured that the connection between the command and the forces of defense in Mariupol is working, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the "AZOVSTAL" plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped a toxic substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons against the "Azovstal" plant, which is held by the "Azov" battalion.
Thank you, I will adjust to you. That would be very good
The situation remains the same for now
2 hours in the car ()) walking, shopping, and back!
It is not important
She forgot what she was going to do
The squadron of Czech drones has started its flights over Ukraine from today.
Almost 50 professional helicoptersüöÅ will be used to detect and some of them - to destroy the enemy aggressorüí•.
Two Carpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" have been sent to Ukraine thanks to the deputy of the Mukachev city council Vladimir Labutenk.
Today, their inter-mountain friends, headed by the chairman of the village council and the coordinator of the page https://www.facebook.com/examplehere/ Vasyl Shchur, delivered the drones to their destination: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian army in different cities, where fighting is currently underway.
In order to use drones as effectively and safely as possible, their location will remain a secret for now.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic say they are not planning to stop any time soon: In the coming days, they plan to send many more interesting "gifts" to Ukraine, which will help to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I'm not worried, everything is fine. I love sweets, but I can do without them
I am worried that we will not make it. A lot of luggage.
I will soon return to Ukraine and continue working
Okay. If everything is okay, I agree
I will do my best, but if there are any problems, I will write to you, if possible?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in the village in Yivov, she saw me and that I was pregnant, but said that there was no housing
Maybe she will be happy and her mood will lift
My phone was repaired today.
And I think that today I even froze on the street.
Drank the pills and tea, feel worse, but not critically.
I'm also sorry, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, send me music that you like.
I'm curious about your musical preferences üòä
mom and dad need to listen
You will find it somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
It was cooler and raining today. It will be warmer tomorrow.
But it's not the destroyed buildings that matter, it's the people who are being abused by the occupiers
In Herson, the occupants mocked the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial in Herson on the street of Peremoha.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore down the flag of the European Union, broke the panels with photographs of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupants tore down the portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the victims of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They took down the flag.
Good morning, thank you for the carol, we did not have such a tradition, so we did not know what to give the children, we only gave them chocolate and cookies, maybe they needed something else

Therefore, we have made great progress.
I will definitely bring vareniki another time!

As I am pushing away from the days and times when there is work to do after the guests, I can roughly say that in April, as I already have an approximate cleaning schedule.
In May - I will be able to say at the end of April or the beginning of May.
I just asked if there was anything being said about it.
Hello, sorry, I haven't written for a long time and I fell asleep a little.
If you don't mind, I could come today?)
or we can meet after your arrival)
He is modest with us, and has been learning a lot recently. He realised that this is what he really needs in life
Hello) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to be working with people at such a high level.
Today I had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the department of economy of the region.
She was very pleased with my work.
Gryshko behaved himself well.
On Monday, I will bring confirmation of employment and cash payment for the crib.

I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you signed up for.
And do they feed the children there, or should I bring them with me?
And now you can ask one question
If you still need help, write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn't want people to think that we were profiting from this!
But for online completion, I lacked two points:
I'll be lying down to rest. Gathering strength and energy. Thank you for today's present. Goodbye.
üòÑüòç What a great idea. I will watch the video now. It will be great because the whole family will paint.
Karazin University calls on employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.

my other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, also helps the army
Gathered a few works for the portfolio.
After the holidays, there will be an internet.
I would like to be your reserve designer.
As far as I'm concerned, the day I didn't go to work is a holiday
Building the headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state."
Literally: "It is not excluded that the Russian Federation's armed forces will carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Pridnestrovian region of the Republic of Moldova with the aim of accusing Ukraine of aggression against a neighbouring state."
Details: The opponent continues to create an offensive grouping of troops for actions on the Slobodian direction.
It is likely that the occupiers will try to resume their offensive in the nearest days.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personnel, weapons and equipment for participation in combat operations on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being prepared at the permanent deployment point of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Army in the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that the mentioned weapons will be transferred to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Recruitment for the 36th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade (Borzya, Zabaykalsky Krai), 29th Army, Eastern Military District, is also underway.
The enemy feels a particular problem while staffing drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The withdrawal of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the opponent will continue to attack objects of transport infrastructure in Ukraine in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of combat operations and destroy or disable them.
Defined units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
Individual units from the 6th Army and the Northern Fleet continue to blockade the city of Kharkiv on the Slobodian direction, and are carrying out artillery strikes against individual districts of the city.
Air reconnaissance of the area is continuing on the Izium direction to locate the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this, the opponent uses the BPLA "Orlan-10".
The enemy attempted to attack in the direction of the populated areas of Dovhenke and Dimitrivka with forces of up to two battalion tactical groups; without success and he withdrew to previously occupied positions.
On the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking control of the populated areas of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhne and Novobakhmutovka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out a storming operation in the area of Zolotoye, without success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue to carry out assault operations in the areas of the "Azovstal" plant and the sea port.
Separate units of the enemy carried out artillery strikes on the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the populated localities of Vysokopillia, Trudolubivka and Mar‚Äôianske.
In the territory of Donetsk and Lugansk regions over the past day, Ukraine's defenders have repelled four attacks by the enemy, destroyed five tanks, eight units of armored, six units of motor vehicles and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Didn't understand your thoughts?
We usually try to catch up, but I doubt
And you want to sleep, and I'm holding you back
are you not against my coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, tell me and I'll understand)
Thank you. We don't watch TV at home and even less so 1+1. We don't need to be programmed)
I turned on the TV just to listen to the Czech language
I'm finishing my monthly tariff today.
Can we do this by phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery
I understand that I can prepare material in this area.
I ask her. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she gives us so many pies.
We will meet with my father later, of course üôèüèª
I read the announcement in Facebook, so Google wrote something on its own. I think the phone number is enough.
Good day, we took the things you brought, but are there things that are small and can be brought to you in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If it's convenient for the director, I'll be able to come to work next week, because I plan to go to the employment bureau to submit documents (if it works out, because the queues are huge) and on Saturday it will rain.
I'm looking for a brigade at the beginning, I really liked chemistry in school, I'm studying Czech to know it perfectly, and my dream is to work for Teva
Old and not very close friends, friends I don't know personally, friends by spirit and mind.
Now hard times have come to you too.
Over the past month, I have spoken to many of you.
Your life, which was never easy to begin with, has been turned upside down, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you admitted that you feel guilt and shame over the actions of your country towards your neighbors.
Because of what you are doing to Ukraine.
Some of you, activists, have been under threat for a long time, and you have been preparing for the final blow.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from the "Memorial".
We'll tell about it later, - Sasha replied laconically, as usual. - Let's walk around the ruins now after the search.
Others - cultural workers, artists, critics, writers - were shocked by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
No one likes Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, and most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: apart from a handful of you - those who worked at the "Memorial", the "New newspaper", "Echo of Moscow", "Meduza", Navalny's organization and a number of other places - how many of you did at least something to oppose this regime?
Apart from participating in rallies, when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of Russian journalist "Late to hide, late to speak"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt - is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are provoked by your long indifference to what is going on around, your apathy and your passive participation, which now, probably, weigh heavily on your soul and heart?
It was not always like this.
There was a brief period in the 1990s when you did have freedom and democracy - messy, bloody, but real.
But 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time there is a revolution, you are overcome by such a strong fear of chaos that you end up seeking salvation behind the back of a tsar, even if his name is Stalin or Putin?
However many people he kills, you still feel safe near him. Why is that?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and making public the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Gestapo, you spared the soul of Dzerzhinsky - and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew itself, reform itself and take power in the country.
When you were faced with the choice between looting the country and bringing back communists, you didn't fight for the possibility of a third option - and meekly accepted the looting.
In 1998 your economy collapsed, and that marked the end of mass rallies for social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then came Mr Putin. Young, energetic, aggressive, he promised to crush the terrorists and revive the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you all voted for it anyway, or abstained from voting at all.
When he started comparing Chechnya to the earth again, most of you closed your eyes to this.
I well remember those years.
I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping those affected by Putin's "anti-terrorist operation," and saw the ruins of Grozny, Katyr-Yurt, Itum-Kali and other cities with my own eyes.
Sometimes, on weekends, I would return to Moscow and have a great time with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: about the torture of peaceful civilians, about children killed, about soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me: "Brad, we're tired of your Chechnya." I very well remember these words.
In response, I was indignant: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, not mine.
I am just a stupid foreigner here.
This is your government shelling one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too hard, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came an economic upswing in the middle of zeroes, driven by rising oil prices and Mr. Putin's willingness to accept that some of the stolen money would remain in middle-class pockets.
Many of you are doing well, some are getting rich, and even the poorest of you have bought new homes and found better jobs.
Prices grew, but is it a disaster?
Moscow shone and sparkled from the chic.
When several opposition figures were killed - Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and appalled at what was happening.
However, the matter did not end there.
When after two terms Putin passed the presidency to Medvedev and took the post of prime minister, you, as I see it, paid little attention to this.
When after several months in power Medvedev's Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you did I meet in the years that followed in the mountains of Gudauta, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we in the West did little if anything.
A bit of indignation, a bit of sanctions; but what does it matter that Russia is flouting international law when the temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market is so great?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the hard 1990s, this was the main thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, finally woke up.
When Mr Putin changed places with Mr Medvedev and returned to the presidency, many of you decided that this was too much, and you took to the streets in protest.
The name Navalny became a byword, you did not leave the streets for a half a year, and the regime eventually felt with horror that it was losing its footing.
After that he struck back.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were imprisoned.
Some received huge terms.
What could we have done?
I hear it so often and hear it still.
The state is so strong and we are so weak.
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Outraged by a pro-Russian president who had betrayed their European hopes, they seized Maidan - and never let it go.
They set up an encampment and prepared to defend it decisively.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they started defending themselves with sticks, armor and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, protesters launched an attack.
Many died, but they won.
The fugitive has become Yanukovych, while Ukrainians have returned democracy, the right to choose their leaders and get rid of them if they do a bad job.
The Maidan was not to Putin's liking.
It was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he seized Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but the benefits were few.
And how many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Somehow a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and began to worship him.
It's hard for me to find a reason because after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of my friends who remained silent.
We are not interested in politics, they said.
And you hide in new books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, just as new after the restoration, which the mayor of Moscow began in 2012 - with their bin bags, free Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.
Truly, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and becomes only more beautiful.
You have barely noticed Syria.
Were there terrorists there, though?
What is IDIL? Even a Moscow-based editor who published my book on Syria slammed it in an interview at the time, saying that I knew nothing about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw with my own eyes how state snipers were cold-bloodedly shooting at children my age in the streets of Homs.
Among all Russian citizens, there were only your soldiers, who started bombing thousands of peaceful citizens in 2015, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Undoubtedly, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
First they came for the socialists, but I remained silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade unionists, but I was silent - because I am not a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent - for I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say anything in my defense."
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did this.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some people really are talking now ‚Äì for example, Dmitry Gluhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zyhar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, risking ending up in a new GULAG or keeping company with Navalny.
As for others, you know best where you live.
Which is why, I'm sure you understand, when Putin is done with the Ukrainians - or if, as seems likely, he can't get his way, he'll come after you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who were brave, but mostly stood alone at the protests, and who have been sentenced to a minor term, but who will soon receive a more serious one.
Out of thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed dissent in social media (even if it was just a black square in Instagram), or who spoke out in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The days when 10 or even 25 years in jail were just a joke are long gone - and now they are waiting for you in your future.
Who will support you then? Who will stay?
The example of Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And what sense, motivation and courage can stop him, however great his advantage on paper.
Considering all this, few in Russia realize it, nor that a war is still ongoing.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news online, have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows that you know.
So be ready.
You understand what it's all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just a joke, your laws are only worth the paper they are written on, you have no independent media left, your economy is collapsing faster than I can write this, you have no credit cards to buy a plane ticket to leave the country, even if there are still some flights available.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try or somehow go, or they'll chew you up.
I doubt that you will see another option.
And yet there remains one.
What finally will topple this regime.
And, possibly, in the conditions that have emerged, you will need less than you think.
Think about this.
The spark will not come from you: due to the economic collapse looming over Russia, it will most likely ignite in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices rise and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if every city goes out to rallies on its own, as has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them one by one.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be transformed into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical instrument - the internet - that the regime can restrict, but which is still working and which can be used almost under any circumstances.
The organization of Navalny was dismantled, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.
You are very many, you are millions.
Moscow police can cope with 30,000 people in the streets of the city, possibly with tens of thousands.
If more than 300,000 come out, she will be shocked.
It will be necessary to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to the matter?
After all, what did he force them to do in Ukraine?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel a familiar fear; those with children will fear for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
I would also be afraid in your place.
In the case of Syria, and now Ukraine, Mr Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to defy their master, those who dare to demand freedom, but really try to achieve it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will be lost in vain.
Your son will make a joke in an online chat room - and be arrested; your daughter will voice her indignation online - and be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and die in a Syrian jail under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years ‚Äì and it will only get worse, growing ever larger in scale.
So you have a choice. If you do nothing, you know what it will lead to.
Act coolly, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were at the lesson on Friday and were told we could come on Monday
We will be at home in the evening
What do you see me as a press secretary
How often do you go to an expensive restaurant for dinner?
Once in a while I go to an expensive restaurant for dinner

I am waiting for new news from her and will definitely inform.
Working as a prosecutor, I thought I was building a career, spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, intellectual work in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a shame to lose the time, but it's a life experience.
I am communicative in my personal life, but I am an only child and I am serious about marriage.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died of heart problems.
I think that to create a family people should love, respect and trust each other.
I have not met such a person yet.

Mr Reihard, I apologise for disturbing you in your free time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natasha's playroom and said hello to her today.
She had an unpleasant situation.
But when the children were going home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said she came to look at the things and put them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valery yesterday opened our children's room until 19:00.
Is it really possible?
The working hours of the room are until 16:00.
And it is our responsibility.
But I don't have to open a page very weak internet

The situation with the Russian invasion - briefing by the adviser to the head of the Office of the President Alexei Areshovich (10.04.2022).
An advisor to the head of the presidential office told the story of a heroic act by a senior officer of the border troops in Mariupol - he was surrounded and wounded, so he blew himself up with a radio station so that it would not fall into enemy hands.
I have a very important question for you: will you help me register my granddaughter who is 5 years old (bronchial asthma) now she has a runny nose and a cough...
We need a family doctor for her who will understand a little bit of Ukrainian or Russian language.
I am very worried about her condition and immediately need to see a doctor.
We live in the Czech Republic, Doln√≠ Chabry. We need a doctor who is located here in Doln√≠ Chabry or somewhere nearby, possibly Brno, but not far from the metro so we can get there.
The butterfly exhibition was very popular.
The moths settled on the children's hands and feet.

Mom has been standing there since 4 a.m.
It is possible that the hostess will leave her phone for communication.
For me, the best option is this house in Prague 8.
The director did not say anything to me about the possibility of sponsorship payment for the child's meals.
Gave me such data for payment.
For part of March and April, I have already paid for food.
Would it be possible for you to help me pay for May and June?
What do I need to do?
Should I turn to the school director with this question?

I don't know what to do.
We need to go to the embassy periodically, I'm waiting for when they can redo the documents, I'm going to ask. I'll look for it here.
