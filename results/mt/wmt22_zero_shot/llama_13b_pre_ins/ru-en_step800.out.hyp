In my opinion, the literature program was formed by ladies of the Balzac age based on their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very same Balzac-age ladies.
And psychology and the torments of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for adolescents.
Teenagers are generally not interested in the psychology of the characters.
Thank you very much, it is very interesting.
Maybe the roses were plush to depict a specific variety?
There are roses of such a shade and with such a structure of petals, reminiscent of velvet, as a rule, dark red, burgundy tones.
And the white roses look different: their petals have an atlas or silky sheen.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige mattress 105x195.
The "Micropack Prestige" model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different sides: a medium-firm surface made of latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, and a moderately soft side made of natural latex.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of a sleeping person, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model are the breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for breathability, is naturally ventilated like coconut coir.
Thanks to this, the healthy microclimate of the sleeping place is preserved.
The warranty period is also extended to the mattress.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, but the service life of the mattress is longer.
Dust and dirt protection is provided by the detachable Jacquard cover, supplied with the set.
Buy a pair of orthopedic pillows - they are recommended for maintaining the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose – coconut provides anatomical support for the spine, latex relaxes muscles.
Include the brain and hunt down such relatives!
It's better not to have them at all...

Andrey, they have explained to you that pensioners work in schools, they will not work in a team.
The teacher of informatics will also not be able to help, as he has not been taught it, the school is playing games in Windows.
So no support.
I remember these dinners and guests at my parents' house with horror.
Guests are standing at the door, and meatballs are still frying on the plate, while the mother is sweeping the floor.
Lord, I have sat down without strength.
And then take the dishes away, and clean the house.
A week before the holiday you drag the products, two days slaughtering, day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
It's a good idea to take a torch with you.
I don't like holidays and guests since then.
I even set the table for my family on a minimum.
And I make sandwiches for them, I bake very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth vaccination against coronavirus inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with new force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, two or three doses of the vaccine against the coronavirus are unlikely to be enough for full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigelt, is convinced of this.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11.
We expect that a fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the fall," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigelt hopes that the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with the flu vaccination".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination may help in the fight against the spread of the new "Omicron" coronavirus strain.
And the new version is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with "Omikron" is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, manufacturers BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection from infection with the new "Omicron" variant of the coronavirus.
Research by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that with two doses of the vaccine, effectiveness was significantly lower: "The neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
“This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron strain infection,” BioNTech and Pfizer highlighted.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the president of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Zalzberg, is calling for the interval between the second and third vaccination to be reduced.
Furthermore, as Zaltsberger believes, accelerated vaccination will affect the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
Israel's experience is very convincing in this regard, the expert stressed.
Vobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vibe, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from the company Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs in that it was originally created with the use for ice fishing in mind, and not just for snagging.
These vibes have a greater specific weight than close analogues, which certainly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting novelties.
Another recognizable feature is the upper pickguard made of sturdy and elastic plastic, providing additional vibration colors when playing vertically or horizontally.
As a "winter vibe" when fishing in steep Bet-A-Vib demonstrates quite aggressive game.
Frequently, the most captivating is simple monotonous animation, that is, the movements of the needle up and down almost without pauses.
When planning a deviation from the vertical axis, it is not very great, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, overgrown with underwater vegetation, kelp and other obstacles, for which it is possible to catch.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when catching winter cod and large perch, and especially in mid-winter, when a precise and aggressive presentation of bait is required.
Reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly unravels and returns to its original vertical position.
Bet-A-Vib is used just as successfully for winter fishing for lake trout.
To satisfy her whims, you can choose between two modifications: with a noisy capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It was also noted that Bet-A-Vib game can excite a passive pike, even if it does not react to a live bait.
With the Bet-A-Vib, you can cast a wide net.
This weave is easy to understand and not fussy, combining well with leather and woven cords of even the largest diameter.
For catching perch, pike, ide or bream, in addition to a uniform bait, a "step", sometimes with "chirping" on the bottom, is also effective.
If you are catching in snagged areas, you can change the point fly to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of snags.
Among its peers, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most reliable and, consequently, one of the most noticeable.
It can be used with equal success on relatively small and on quite deep sections.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young idlers are sitting on the shoulders of old parents.
The "golden youth" - clearly expressed layabouts in the majority, who can do nothing and don't know anything.
A dull life inclines to idleness.
Mishustin may have had this considerable part of the population in mind.
You, of course, are joking.

In Libya, 7,000 Russian mercenaries have been announced
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) "Wagner" in Libya.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khalid al-Mishri.
At present, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the "Wagner" private military company in Libya.
They have planes too.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 fighters at their air bases in Ghardabiya (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," Anadolu quoted him as saying.
Haled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "installing their man in power" in the Central African Republic.
Preserve presence
According to the publication's interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya."
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the air base and port in Sirte, as well as the air base in Jufra, the publication notes.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where else can mercenaries be hired
According to the agency, "Wagner" is supposedly operating in nine countries in Africa - the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, "Vagner's" subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use mineral and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," the article says.
According to the media, "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed in law enforcement agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters do not appear in personnel lists.
This company is under US sanctions.
Recall that ambassadors of 27 EU countries earlier approved restrictions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the Council of the European Union will approve this decision on December 13.
Situation in Libya
The High State Council of Libya de facto is the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions and dominated by Islamists, TASS writes.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single day of voting for the election of parliamentarians and the head of state from December 24 at least to February 2022.
"With less than two weeks to go before the election, the chances of it being held on time are rapidly diminishing," the report says.
Against this backdrop, the Libyan Higher Election Commission has postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports.
Russia's foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% think that failures predominate.
Examples of successes - "We defended and restored peace in Syria," "Nord Stream-2 solved," "The whole world was scared by our powerful weapons," "Crimea was ours."
The main failures are the "conflict with Ukraine," "confrontation with Western countries," and "isolation from the world," the study by the Foundation "Public Opinion" says.
The government of Dubai has fully refused paperwork - all government services have also become digital
The government of Dubai announced a full refusal from paperwork and transition to digital technologies.
All public services for the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This was reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
Today marks the start of a new phase of digitization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, said on Saturday.
From now on, internal and external document circulation in all government institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The initiative affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, the police, municipal bodies, courts, and so on. Many commercial structures also joined the initiative of the government.
The transition to e-government and digitization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, the authorities estimate that 33.6 million sheets of paper have been saved, which is equivalent to 14 million hours of human work and 353.8 million dollars.
Earlier, Mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin stated that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Well, yes, about dates of birth and how old the kid is, it's all nonsense, about the class and the group in the kindergarten too.
I don't believe that such things happen.
And if they do, they clearly don't give a damn about anything, including their family.
My mother, her two brothers and grandfather with grandmother lived at 3 Vladimirskaya, the first floor without grilles.
They first knocked on the door, then on the window, then decided not to waste time and broke the window and got in, but the grandfather had a baseball bat and they got it.
These people definitely knew that someone was home...
Production and export of cars in Turkey fell below the level of 2020
Production and exports of cars in Turkey fell sharply in November against the backdrop of the devaluation of the lira.
According to Bloomberg, citing data from the Turkish Automotive Manufacturers Association, the industry's figures for the first 11 months of the year were worse than the previous year's result.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 vehicles were released from factories in Turkey, which is 20% less than in the previous year.
Some 759,000 vehicles were exported, which is 25% less than in the same period last year.
And if in the first 10 months of this year the Turkish automotive sector demonstrated positive dynamics compared to the previous year, then according to the results of 11 months of 2021, the release of cars turned out to be 0.3% worse than the previous year.
The reason for such a decline was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 MSB subjects received a deferral on credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov spoke about the situation with the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform" reports.
According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on regulation and development of financial market, in the current year in execution of the instruction of the Head of state from April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency from April 9, 2021 No. 127 "On approval of the Order of providing postponement of payments on loans of subjects of small and medium business" was issued, - Alihan Smailov wrote in his answer to the deputy's inquiry.
He reminded that the order on the postponement of payments on loans provided for the postponement of payments on loans by banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities to subjects of the MSB, including IPs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The period of deferral ranged from 30 to 90 days, depending on the choice of the MSB subject.
In the borrower's statement, the term of the loan could be different.
During the suspension of proceedings against the borrower, the claimant's work was suspended, notification of the need to repay the overdue debt was suspended, and the creditor was not allowed to charge commissions and other payments," the first deputy prime minister noted.
In 2021, applications for deferral of payments on loans were received from 603 borrowers-subjects of MSB, of which deferral was received by 553 subjects of MSB for a total of 9.7 billion tenge.
In the MFO, applications for deferral were filed by 131 MSB subjects, of which deferral was granted to 95 subjects for a total of 105.8 million tenge," Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puryazev suggested that people with a weak immune system can easily carry the "okmion" strain
The doctor suggested that people with a weakened immune system might be able to fight it off more easily than those with a strong immune response
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the "okmion" strain of the coronavirus may be dangerous.
The reason is to be found in the conditions under which the virus arose.
Scientists believe that "okmion" was born in the body of an infected HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
That is, he did not encounter any resistance from the immune system.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no immune response, it became very fast.
Apparently, he had these spike proteins, thorns, maybe more than necessary, their antibodies were not shortened during the mutations, - commented a pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor surmised that people with a weakened immune system may be able to tolerate "okmiron" better than those with a strong protective reaction of the organism.
It turns out that a strong response of the organism to anything, to any infection - is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when a 30-year-old dies, while 60-year-olds carry on as if nothing had happened.
The immune response is furious in young people, it is completely inadequate: where it was only possible to threaten with a finger, it hits like a cannonball, - Sergei Puryazev concluded.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the worst of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the first case is successfully treated and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to buy only the symptoms - all hope for the organism.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the organism - this is fever, weakness, malaise.
Then come respiratory symptoms: difficult breathing, a sore throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also be a sign of a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old may be vaccinated by the end of the year.
Virologist and head of the genome engineering laboratory at MFTI Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from the coronavirus.
Among teenagers who go to school, the number of contacts is maximized.
This is the most socially active layer of the population, just like the children who attend kindergartens, said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and the head of the genome engineering laboratory at MFTE, to "Moscow 24".
Great thanks to the author for this article.

Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of the coronavirus
The authors studied the fatty tissue remaining after bariatric surgery and found that the fat cells known as adipocytes can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in the fatty tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and demonstrated a strong inflammatory response.
Researchers also examined the fatty tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and found traces of the virus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that viruses such as HIV and the flu can hide in fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir to try to evade the immune system.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of this.
Biologist told about reasons of dementia appearance
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Golosheykin named the reasons for the appearance of dementia and told about the ways of its prevention in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, this disease affects more than 55 million people.
The syndrome is characterized by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty navigating even familiar surroundings.
Golosheykin noted that dementia is usually caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of such factors as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity can be played," he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, disruption of the sleep regime and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first symptoms, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and reduction of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease or one of the risk factors for its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the disease, WHO recommends maintaining a healthy weight, training cognitive skills and abilities that require memory and logic.
Previously a professor at the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the FG AOU VO RNIMU named after
N.I. Pyrogova, head of the Department of Cognitive Disorders at the Federal Center of Brain and Neurotechnologies, Anna Bogolepova, told about the reasons for memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30,000 illegally exported artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the government of Care has managed to return to Egypt about 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, by Shaaban Abdel Gawad, the chief inspector of the Department of Restored Antiquities at the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, on the Al-Hayat TV channel.
Since 2011, Egypt has managed to return 29,300 artefacts.
This year alone, 5,300 artifacts from ancient Egyptian civilization have been discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gawad clarified that all the artefacts smuggled out have been registered in the archives.
Currently, department employees are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts "track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian websites and social networks.
The chief inspector said that after the return of cultural values, they are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts is an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium that is now part of the collection of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol for help in finding the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, which was sold at an auction in London.
The auction house Christie's held an auction on July 4, where a bust aged over 3,000 years was sold for $5.97 million (around 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent from Egypt.
Egypt also claims that the artefact was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the god Amon, has been kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is a mystery.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of ancient monuments illegally exported from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of contraband antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
“Crimean Tatars are not taken into account” – and this is right, because Crimean Tatars (232,000 people) are a separate nation (related to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (of Kazan) live in Crimea (see the census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this nation consists of two words!
The only thing that unites them is the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, the Financial Times writes.
The reason for this is that in Europe and the USA the Swiss bank does not provide its employees with corporate devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, a bank can review information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work-related tasks.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management set a deadline for employees to get acquainted with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego."
He is no longer a member of any literary groupings, he has no truck with imagism, he is his own man but he is known, he is in demand, he is sometimes roundly criticised, even viciously, but the reading public is prepared to carry him on its shoulders.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them - true masterpieces, the "Persian Motifs" cycle was completed, the poem "Anna Sneegina" was written, 8 books were published, including the collection "Russia Soviet".
And the main success - at the end of June, the State Publishing House concluded a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
No modern poet has been granted such honour as Sergey Aleksandrovich, he was the first!
In addition, this promised very good money - the contract stipulated a monthly salary of 1000 rubles for 20 months (the factory director, for example, received 300 rubles a month, an engineer - 200).
The funds were needed more than ever that year.
Yesenin married Sofia Tolstoy, the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, and had to arrange his family life, support his sisters Katy and Sasha, and his mother.
It seems that life is being arranged, that there is something to be happy about, but for him everything is mainly shaded in dark tones, as if a nightmare had materialized from the poem "The Black Man" (composed in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death):
My friend, my friend,
I am very and very ill.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is the wind whistling
Over the empty and deserted field,
Oh, as in September,
Alcohol affects the brain.
Many of his acquaintances noted that Yesenin looked bad, pale, and obviously ill.
There are more and more outbursts, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason, probably, is not only alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was put to Sergei Alexandrovich, there were no reliable documents left.
For example, from May 1923, when, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American actress Isadora Duncan, Yessenin was treated in a clinic in Paris by Professor Petr Gannushkin (again, Yessenin will return to him two years later, in Moscow).
But as for testimonies of the poet's drinking bouts, scandals on this account, and reports to the police - there are dozens of memoirs.
With the beginning of the 20s, the terrible romance of the poet with the green snake rapidly developed.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin lived for a short time with his friend, the imagist Ivan Starcev.
It's amazing, but with his very decent income, Yesenin never had his own place to live, neither in Moscow nor in St. Petersburg, he would find himself in rented flats, hotels or with friends.
Starcev recalls:
He came only to sleep, and in most cases in an unconscious, drunken state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Yesenin fell on the staircase...
Falling, he scraped his face and shrieked.
Coming to his senses, he began to cough unceasingly, spraying the entire cloth with blood..."
And even Esenin himself after his travels around Europe and in the USA (at that time there was a dry law in the States, but Duncan took a decent supply of spirits with her) admitted:
I didn't see anything there, just pubs and streets...
I'm already at the end and I've stopped remembering people...
Well, and drank, of course...
And I drank because I was lonely."

His son is almost 16 now, and he hasn't had the urge to smoke for a long time.
All his energy is directed at choosing what he will do to make a living.
He's much more responsible than I was in his or my husband's, who had periodic brushes with the law before we married.
The father takes care of his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strange love".
Why did the girl cry at the exam when she hadn't even failed it?
Why did he not tell his daughter that it was not a school.

Poland's Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus is using migrants as "weapons" against the EU
Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus is using migrants as "weapons"
Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski said that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such "operation" next year.
The statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus have "temporarily stopped Lukashenko," but he is "actively seeking new ways."
The Polish official also believes that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon "in many parts of the world."
As reported by the website kp.ru, the European Union had earlier introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 physical persons and 11 organizations.
In Europe they stated their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic "if the situation in the country does not improve".
In response, Minsk introduced a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

At social events in 2021, barathea jackets dominated.
Perhaps the first to declare his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
In September, at the premiere of the film "Not Time to Die," he appeared in a velvet mauve jacket and traditional "Bond" bow tie.
Prince William followed his example twice: he first appeared at the ceremony of awarding the environmental prize The Earthshot Prize wearing an inappropriate green baroque jacket, and then chose a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety Charity.
A couple of weeks ago the trend caught up with Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to collect the seventh "Golden Ball" in a Dolce & Gabbana suit.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same way.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for silk men's shirts in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, who provided the information to Gazeta.Ru, they have become 1.4 times more popular.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with padding and draped silhouette, the main colors are dark-beige, dark-brown, dark-blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively shirts - suits they choose less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, jackets made of velvet can be found in almost all brands this season - including Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most coveted model is considered to be Gucci, in which the ambassador of the brand Jared Leto appeared in one of the premieres of the film "Gucci House".
Choosing an expensive brand of pyjamas, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special technology of interlacing threads it is possible to get a dense fabric with a velvety outer texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but they also serve less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but appropriateness.
A velvet jacket requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a formal event, explains Vakoshkin. - It will also do for those cases if the dress code in the invitation says "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion for choosing a velvet jacket is the status of its buyer.
A man in a velvet blazer, above all, should have a proper advanced wardrobe with a surplus, - say the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Krasavchik Brammell". - Owners of velvet blazers, as a rule, belong to the category of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to secular events, where a dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakoshkin suggests combining a jacket made of brocade with the same elegant items of clothing: classic trousers with stripes, monochrome shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Krasavchik Brammell" are sure: it would be inappropriate for a rank-and-file employee to appear at a corporate event in a velvet blazer, but if we are talking about "a manager from among those who run the event" - "then yes, such a thing is in theme for him".
If an employee is demoted, but the goal is to move up in a complex corporate hierarchy or to get a financial bonus, it is better not to wear a silk shirt.
Management will definitely appreciate the phrase "not for the sake of fashion" - editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion believe.
Very ambiguous feelings about the voice.
It's an unnatural tone, so strained.
And it does not associate with the sweet face of a young girl.
If I'm honest, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But I wish you all the best in life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well lobbied, i.e. paid for.
Billion-dollar investments.
Were they sad?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy is also out of fashion - gas, oil and coal were cheaper to buy than they are now.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
Coin drops.
And who is flying then?
As usual - a regular customer.
Does the sheriff care about the problems of the Indians?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots, "sleeping" through the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good mood.
I didn't see a single beautiful person in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity within average passengers.
Perhaps if such characters are so confident in their beauty as to want to show it off to the entire train carriage, then they probably won't be bothered by such comments.
But only due to mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties", but not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who knows his slavery and fights against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave who does not know he is a slave, and who lives in silent, unconscious, and speechless slavery, is simply a slave.
A slave, whose saliva flows when he describes the pleasures of slavery and exalts a good and generous master, is a slave, a toady."
The immunologist said that revaccination after 4-5 months will help protect against the "omikron" strain of the coronavirus.
Vaccination after four to five months may protect against the new "omikron" coronavirus strain.
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kruglov, who called the vaccination after six months, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period"
“Under previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure after five months, and people with chronic diseases - after four,” the expert said, calling to carry out revaccination parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kruchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or he has recovered and been vaccinated, or he has been vaccinated and recovered, then he has "hybrid immunity," that is, a lot of antibodies and enough to neutralize," the expert clarified.
The "Big Seven" warned Russia of "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The countries of the "Big Seven" (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the USA, France and Japan) published a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that "military aggression" of Russia against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow dearly," but concrete measures in the document are not described.
We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement says.
Ministers then call on Russia "to de-escalate, to use diplomatic channels, and to abide by its international commitments on transparency in military activities," as President Biden said during a video call to President Putin on December 7.
We reiterate our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in the east of Ukraine," the foreign ministers of the "Big Seven" also said.
The use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price to pay," they warn.
We reiterate our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation to provide a comprehensive and all-round response," the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, stated that Russia would face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "a united voice of the 'Big Seven' countries, which account for 50% of global GDP, and which clearly stated that the invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia."
Pfizer's vaccine was considered 32 times less effective against the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was deemed less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
We see that in most people there was a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant," Professor Malik Peiris said.
At the same time, the scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against a severe course of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the pandemic based on the influence of the omicron strain.
The authors of the study concluded that the omega strain could cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and increase mortality if no additional measures are taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the delivery of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of former Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition of lethal weapons by Kiev within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times newspaper on December 12, Reznikov reminded that in the previous month Germany had vetoed the purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles for shooting down drones by Ukraine.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to acquire the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with its allies.
In particular, the US, Britain, Lithuania and France are mentioned.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Angela Merkel on the resumption of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andrey Melnyk, said that Kiev should not wait for arms deliveries from Berlin under Chancellor Merkel.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons with the risk of military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the "occupation of Russia" part of Ukrainian territory.
Such a "non-logical" position, the diplomat is confident, Germany will maintain and with the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky stated that Kiev is expecting assistance from Berlin in equipping the naval fleet.
Ukraine is counting on Germany to be its "partner in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the Republic, where he spoke out in favor of selling defensive weapons to Kiev.

A table appeared on the screen, showing what country produces what percentage of these semiconductors (presumably, microcontrollers).

I'm sorry for her, she lived her life in anger.

The foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, according to the final statement of the parties.
Participants in the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of Russian armed forces on the country's borders.
There should be no doubt in Russia that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and costs," the statement, published on the British government website, says.
Ministers of the G7 countries and the High Representative of the EU noted that "we are united in our condemnation of Russian military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine."
British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss warned of "big consequences" for Russia if it invaded Ukraine, at a press conference in Liverpool.
We have clearly stated that there will be significant consequences to any invasion...
G7 wants Russia to abandon aggression towards Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis due to the buildup of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
The talks were about negotiations in the "Normandy format".

Ways to return money stolen through online stores have been revealed
There are several ways to get your money back after it has been stolen through an online store, and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by experts in information security in a conversation with RBK.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of major losses in the event that the bank card falls into the hands of fraudsters, it is recommended to store the main funds on the card or bank account, which are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend opening a separate card for purchases in the network.
If money was stolen during purchases in stores not using 3D Secure technology, you can start the refund process.
According to the rules set by the payment systems, responsibility for unauthorized transactions carried out without using 3D Secure lies with the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service, a representative of Promsvyazbank specified.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert from international payment provider Ecommpay, stressed that the buyer has the right to submit a claim to the bank to dispute the fraudulent operation not later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be contested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores return funds to the client themselves, if the order has not yet been delivered.
On November 19, member of the Public Chamber, director of the League of Safe Internet Ekaterina Mikulina reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 complaints were received about various fraud cases: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online scammers.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss "Nord Stream-2" and EU legislation
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, arrived in Warsaw for talks concerning the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream-2".
Although Scholz stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would call on Scholz to speak out against the "Nord Stream 2" pipeline, which is planned to deliver Russian gas to Germany via the Baltic Sea, bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravetzky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for the dispute.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, establishing that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its supreme court ruled that national legislation has priority over EU rules.
The new German government, which was sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not undertake public commitments to stop the work of the "Nord Stream-2" in the event of an invasion of Russia in Ukraine.
American officials told members of Congress that they reached an understanding with Germany on halting the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior congressional aide said Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz warned of the consequences if Russia violates the border of Ukraine, and this position was confirmed by representatives of the "Big Seven" on Sunday.
Dmitry, look more carefully.
The view from the window is the same, the size of the window hasn't changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the room has been removed, so you can see part of the second window.
And those who are not familiar with the initial planning.
And I know such apartments and I see very well how they have been replanned.
I wish them all the best.
It is always surprising when they write about means to clean the shell, the toilet, the skirting boards, the taps.
You have them once a year at Easter, don't you, when you have to wash them.
Just don't pollute.
Ministry of Culture wants to give writers residences
In the future, the state will transfer federal property, inherited from the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Literary Fund of the USSR, to the support fund for Russian writers.
Residencies for writers will be created on this basis, "Parliamentary Newspaper" was told at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which will become the founder of the fund.
The Ministry of Culture is preparing a presidential decree on the creation of a Foundation to support Russian writers.
It is specified in the explanatory note that the fund will be in charge of, among other things, taking care of the targeted use and preservation of buildings and constructions that once belonged to the Soviet Union Union of Writers and the Literature Fund.
"A significant number of objects of immovable property, previously belonging to the Literary Fund of the USSR, have passed into the ownership of the Russian Federation, including objects located in the town of writers Peredelkino, the Komarovo settlement in the Leningrad region and others," "Parliamentary Newspaper" was informed in the press service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The project bill orders to reflect in the foundation's charter that it is "established for the purpose of assisting literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers."
What is meant by the "creation of conditions for creative activity" is the creation of writer's residencies based on the transferred assets in different regions of Russia, where there would be comfortable conditions for creativity," explained the Ministry of Culture to our publication.
520 rubles for one sliced tomato?
Sour dough bread - this is a loaf of bread in its purest form, straight from the pack for 550 rubles.

Doctors warn of the dangers of long-term use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yarceva and Sergey Tokarev warned about the dangers of uncontrolled use of fibrinolytic drugs after the coronavirus infection COVID-19 and before vaccination against the coronavirus.
Irina Yarceva, a therapist and immunologist, said that independent prevention of possible thrombosis after COVID-19 may cause a stroke.
Yarceva explained that blood thinning drugs are not prescribed to everyone, but only if the patient was hospitalized, was in the hospital, and had complications.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood thinners that prevent excessive clotting) based on indications.
She said that there is currently an epidemic of madness - all sorts of anti-coagulants are being drunk for long periods and people are experiencing haemorrhagic strokes (bleeding in the brain) as a result.
Sergey Tokarev, the chief prophylactologist of Ural Federal District, the scientific leader of the Society of Specialists in Preventive Medicine, Doctor of Medical Sciences, in an interview with URA.RU said that nowadays Russians often use anticoagulants chaotically and before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the Internet and start self-treating.
There are citizens who, a week before vaccination, on their own initiative start taking anticoagulants.
And doctors notice hematoma during a preliminary examination before vaccination.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found the money in the wall of the church will be paid $20,000
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This is reported in the press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident happened at a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches that faithful Christians can expect wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cole was renovating one of the church's toilets when he discovered thousands of pounds worth of cash and cheques hidden beneath the insulation.
He gave the find to the church and, according to him, did not even receive thanks from Austin.
I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
It appears that the discovery is linked to a theft that occurred at the Lakewood church seven years ago.
Then around $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks, which were kept in the church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of $25,000 was offered for information about the criminals.
Justin Coulombe was not eligible for that amount because the deadline for the award had passed.
Despite that, the nonprofit Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had earlier given a $5,000 reward and later received another $20,000 in donations from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
Earlier, it was reported that police interviewed Pastor Joel Austin about money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person."
That is why there is such a negative attitude towards her.
And it's not that "she is financially significantly richer than all the writers," as they write here.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone behaves so brazenly, so provocatively, as this Madame.

In Brazil, a judge of the Federal Supreme Court (STF) ordered the requirement of a valid COVID-19 passport from people entering the country.
This was reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination have been exempted from presenting a certificate of vaccination.
The list of exclusions also includes people arriving from countries where the vaccine is not available.
The situation is even more serious if we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-Carnival and Carnival parties and other events, which implies an increase in the flow of tourists," Barroso said.
Earlier, Brazilian authorities required unvaccinated tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
The scheme of full protection from COVID-19 has been revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, and Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altshtein revealed the scheme of full protection from coronavirus infection in an interview with Ura.ru.
According to him, this can be achieved by introducing injections and using a nasal vaccine.
When the vaccine is administered intranasally, a large amount of immunoglobulin A is produced. When the vaccine is administered by injection, this does not occur.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the organism.
And inside us, after vaccination, the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies) are formed.
And if you get both vaccines, you'll get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's no solution for a dual vaccination yet," the medic said.
The chief prophylactic of Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injection is the possibility to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help to maximize the body's protection in such cases.
Earlier, Minister of Healthcare of the Nizhny Novgorod Region David Melik-Guseynov stated that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new surge of the pandemic.
According to him, such a picture is observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hm...
I used to talk to my dog (who died a long time ago) like this: if you're ready to exchange a warm home, food, petting, love and games for a dripping bitch, go ahead.
But Pesel was trained and generally clever.
I chose my society and went home.
The method shown in the video works in 90% of cases.
Not taken from the ceiling, trust me.
I stopped many owners from running after their dogs, so they wouldn't run away, even though they said that 200,000 rubles were at stake (they were bragging), and I took them by the hand and led them in another direction.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose the owner, and not the dog, which ran somewhere there.
Massive protests against vaccination continue in Europe
In the Austrian capital Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with restrictive measures and the authorities' plans to make vaccination against Covid mandatory.
Unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros from February next year.
Outraged by the government's healthcare policies, Spaniards held a peaceful demonstration in Madrid.
Some held placards saying "This is a false pandemic," "I will not be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a COVID certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, sports halls, retirement homes and night entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was taken by a number of regions in the country against the backdrop of an increase in the number of cases of infection with the coronavirus.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action started peacefully, but then turned into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of demonstrators started throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nicholas S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this issue.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine," probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve this title.
I only agree with Zakharova on one thing: Americans have brought nothing but death and plunder to any country they've touched.

WHO discovered "omikron" in dozens of countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new strain of coronavirus "omicron" has been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The speed of the spread of the virus was reported in a statement by WHO.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the virus has been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has only been actively spreading since the end of November.
WHO also expressed concern about the rapid spread of the new coronavirus variant.
Experts from the WHO express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the "delta" strain, which is the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in absolutely all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in Great Britain.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omikron" will replace "delt" in the coming months.
And the number of people infected in the UK alone will be around 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially there are only a few hundred people infected with the virus in the UK at the moment, with estimates ranging from a few thousand to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "omikron" strain, with more than 2,000 people being taken to hospital every day at the peak.
What the British healthcare system will be unable to cope with.
The situation is exacerbated by the fact that according to the latest research, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "omikron" strain is 32 times lower compared to other forms of the disease.
It is not known how the Russian "Sputnik V" will react to "omikron" - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has only started testing the Russian vaccine on the "omikron" strain.

Interesting Blondie, you're right, Internet communication is quite different, it's easy and unconstrained, but in person you can't say anything.

When you meet your person, then the glances change.
And again, Soviet times are called "the time of demons."
Then people believed in God much more honestly than today.
And they were brought up practically according to God's laws (love for one's neighbour, don't steal and so on).
What is today's ideology - money at any price.
It is hard to believe in Globa's type of faith (and she does not have it at all), but even if so, the time of demons has passed in the 90s...
Our communal apartment in St. Petersburg, that is, in Leningrad, is still alive.
Of course, we're not the closest of friends, but we try to maintain a warm relationship with the older generation.
Perhaps it was due to the fact that there were no out-of-towners in the apartment, the rooms were not rented, and the blockade brotherhood had not been cancelled.
Unfortunately, we see each other more and more at funerals.

What for?

At least seven people were killed and 175 injured in powerful rainstorms that lashed the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia and the neighboring Minas Gerais.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the rescue services.

135 billion dollars went to applications - Hi-Tech
In 2021, users' spending in applications grew worldwide by 25%, while the number of downloads increased by 8%.
The most popular in the world were various video services.
Users downloaded the CapCut video editor the most, and spent the most time on YouTube.
And the number of app downloads and user spending in them showed significant growth in the period from January to November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. Spending on applications grew even more significantly, by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile applications market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from the lockdown and began post-pandemic recovery.
Will such a "return to physical" growth of the economy slow down? Not at all, say the authors of the report.
India is the leader in the number of app downloads: it accounts for about 20% of all downloads.
They are followed by the US (9%) and Brazil (8%).
iOS users, as before, spent more than Android users: iOS accounted for 65% of all spending on applications.
Among the applications, the video editor CapCut took the first place by the number of downloads in 2021.
They are followed by two Indian applications: MX TakaTak video service and Meesho e-commerce app.
Telegram is also in the top 10 by the number of downloads.
In general, judging by the number of downloads, VPN services (two of which are in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to creating and broadcasting video (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak in the top 10, there are two more such services - Moj and SnackVideo).
Most users spent the most time in applications for live streaming and online streaming, according to the authors of the report.
Leading the way is YouTube, with video service TikTok, streaming services Disney+ and HBO Max, and Japanese subscription manga service Piccoma, rounding out the top five in terms of user spending.
The first places by the number of monthly active users are taken by Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok, and the top-5 is closed by the mobile version of Microsoft Office.
In Russia, the leader in terms of the number of downloads per year turned out to be the shopping application AliExpress.
Zenly, which shows the location of friends, and all the same CapCut.
Also in the top 10 are: the online karaoke app StarMaker, online fashion retailer Shein, the Maps for Minecraft PE app, the Didi taxi-ordering service, Pure Tuber, a client for YouTube, the "Dixi" retailer app and the "Selfrade" online store.
People around the world have adapted to the pandemic by switching to mobile life, which can be called one of the main conclusions.
Those industries that helped people be closer, both virtually and in person, achieved the greatest success," said Lexi Sidow, head of marketing insights at App Annie, commenting on the report.
The mobile gaming sector generated revenue of $90 billion in 2021. Leading the way in terms of downloads were casual and hyper-casual games, which have little or no storyline, and minimal video content.
The top three most popular games in the world are Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the most popular games are DOP 2: Delete One Part; Going Balls; and Phone Case DIY.
Previously, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends for the next year, analysts named the growth of the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the growth of financial applications popularity among Generation Z, for example, Robinhood investment application, as well as the further increase in the popularity of metaviral mobile games.

Russians warned about a new scam
Scammers are looking for new ways to scam people via video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon Director of Products Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communications tools is fraud.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings with the participation of the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to precisely reproduce the characteristics of a person's behavior.
Abutalimov added that using a deepfake, scammers can call the victim's relatives via video conferencing or create a video with a copy of a person for distribution with the aim of blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily cause a bubble, since a skilled fraudster can place people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," the expert said.
Leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Vetkol in turn noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to technologies using video.
David, I add.
In what I wrote above, I drew attention to the fact that all this was bought in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow to dress up and wear short skirts, show socks and sandals.
This is a province, but there was such a product in the store.
In big cities and Muslim women were painted, and lies were shown.
And so it is in Dushanbe, a big city, the capital of the republic.
There is a lot of make-up, but no cosmetics.
Five actions to avoid sugar diabetes
Problems with blood sugar levels - one of the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and quite rightly.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a key role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water positively affects metabolism.
Sweet products raise blood sugar to a dangerous level when consumed in excessive amounts.
That is why the first step on the road to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and storing them at home.
The disease is influenced not only by an incorrect diet, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts recommend following a low-carb diet.
Such a diet not only helps to lose weight, but also protects from sharp fluctuations in the level of sugar.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of pasta.
Dietary fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of satiety, the secretion of digestive juices and the absorption of food.

Doctor Pavlova told about "weekend migraine" among workaholics
Several factors may contribute to worsening mood over the weekend
The reason for the deterioration of self-feeling after working days is often "weekend migraine", a well-known doctor-endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior scientific worker of the fundamental medicine faculty of MGU, scientific leader of the System Medicine Clinic Zukhra Pavlova told in her telegram-channel.
According to her, people who work long hours are particularly prone to this, as well as those who experience headaches, exhaustion and weakness on their days off.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue of the week, there are quite a few objective reasons for the negative reaction of the organism to the change in conditions.
Our life fundamentally changes on weekends.
I sleep for a long time, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more, but drink less - the doctor argued. - Because of the lack of coffee, a small breakdown begins.
Because of overeating and lack of water - heaviness and brokenness".
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction, which is called jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in deteriorating self-esteem, Pavlova recommended tracking which changes the most over the weekend.

Scientists from South Africa announced low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against "omikron"
In South Africa, Pfizer's vaccine was said to be ineffective against "omikron"
Scientists from the South African Republic conducted research and reported low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "omikron") corresponds to (the level of) the effectiveness of the vaccine at 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which... casts doubt on the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, - says the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK, with more hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar in common products?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that the product may contain hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition and glycemic index.
The label may contain several dozen names, in essence referring to sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names - glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (sugar obtained from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), maltodextrin (modified starch), agave syrup and so on.
These are all simple carbohydrates, which are mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery products, but also in ketchup, in doctor's loaf, bread and so on.
As stated in Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed products, as well as pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar taste different, but no matter how the ingredient is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is difficult to accurately count the exact amount of sugar, as you need to consider not only the amount of sugar indicated by the producer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits and etc. originally contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, stated that the import of gas is becoming less important for Germany as the country continues its transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045 and become a climate-neutral country.
That is, after 25 years the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role, - the Chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to adhere to the position that Ukraine should transport Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is currently of great importance for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was fixed.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock stated that the certification process of the "Nord Stream-2" gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, during the coalition talks and discussions on the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also noted that the pipeline "does not meet the requirements" of the European Union.

Hackers broke into the Twitter account of the Prime Minister of India
Hackers have broken into the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Scammers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment means, and that the country had already purchased cryptocurrency.
In Modi's office, they asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the prime minister stated that Twitter reacted quickly - access to the account was restored.
The page of the premiere of India has already been hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
At the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results, announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, most residents of New Caledonia voted against independence during the referendum.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted for independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against it.
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia taking part in the election.
As the France-Presse news agency comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," since supporters of independence called on voters not to take part in the vote.
As initiators of the referendum, they spoke out against its holding on December 12, considering that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the archipelago made it impossible to hold a full-fledged and "honest" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this abstention opened the way to the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia after the referendums held in November 2018 and in October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, and in 2020, 53.3%.
As stated by the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last voting and will challenge them in the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, in the Elysée Palace, the President of France Emmanuel Macron should speak about the results of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence has livened up the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
A few candidates for the presidency spoke out in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of European Union presence in the Pacific Ocean."
Eric Zemmour kept repeating that "New Caledonia must remain French."
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecresse, who at the end of October published a column in Le Figaro calling on Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron declared in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility."
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire for the choice of the Caledonians to be the choice of France."
Hello, world!

Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of Russia-US relations.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and made a number of insulting statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of the speech, Hartwell called on Western countries to "stand united against Russia."
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
This article contains a lot of false information," one reader commented to RIA Novosti.
“Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and its NATO allies will never go to war with Russia over Ukraine, another said.

Magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred in the Kuril Islands region
A magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The fire was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded a magnitude 7.5 earthquake in Peru, in which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new generation of drones
Reactive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type will be produced at the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant.
This was reported by the advisor to the head of the Ukrainian presidential office, Aleksey Arestovich, on December 11.
That is, they are capable of acting against air targets, against other drones.
Even against piloted aviation.
They will be equipped with Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the fuselage and so on," - quoted by Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA apparatus, Arestovich said that it was a question of a reactive, rather than a piston, UAV.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceeds it "in all characteristics."
The first batch of BPLA should be produced by the factory at the end of the next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the course of military operations by the United Forces in Donbass.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced that construction of a factory to manufacture modern military drones has begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the Bayraktar Savunma company and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kyiv region, where personnel will be trained, as well as the testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar drones.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum "a big real step forward."
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions escaped in Singapore's Changi Airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from the container with seven lions, which arrived at one of the aircraft.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were heading to.
One of the escaped lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not get away from him because a protective fence had been set up nearby.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of employees of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which manages all Singapore zoos.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and wandered the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home and no one was hurt.
Experts warn of cancer threat from vitamin B9
Research suggests that too much vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by Daily Express.
According to experts, there is evidence that people who do not suffer from a lack of folic acid are less likely to suffer from some types of cancer, including colon cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Beth Kitchin, a dietitian at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, suggests keeping track of how much folic acid you're getting each day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, to monitor the dose and avoid chewing gum and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Since it contains avocado, among other things, Fain recommended that men after 50 eat more of the fruit.
In the UK, around 75,000 people may die from the omicron strain by April
British scientists predict that due to the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus in the UK in the next five months, up to 750,000 people may die if restrictive measures are not tightened in the winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper, referring to a study by experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists, who are part of the scientific and advisory group on emergencies in the British cabinet of ministers, by April 2022, not less than 25,000 deaths will be registered in the country due to the omicron strain, and about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the epidemic, hospitals will be accepting more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Serious measures to tackle the coronavirus may be needed to prevent the NHS becoming overwhelmed if the omicron strain turns out to be more infectious than the delta variant and currently available vaccines do not offer complete protection," said mathematician Dr Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK's Health and Safety Executive said if the current rate of spread of the omega strain continues, there will be around 1 million cases in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the omega strain may become the dominant one in the UK.
At present, 1,898 cases of infection with the omicron strain of the coronavirus have been discovered in the UK, including 633 in the last 24 hours.
Meanwhile, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

Demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter in the world
Construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records around the world, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and fight climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1200 units - a quarter more than in the previous year.
In the era of fighting climate change, it is hard to imagine that the number of people willing to spend £50m-plus on a floating fortress will not diminish, the Guardian reports.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn't been this kind of frenzy in the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with partners in business personally, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted by phone.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that the yard is already taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, just to have their yacht ready at least a year or two earlier.
People just want freedom, and the super-rich can afford it, he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior by the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, space travel, yachting or flying in private planes cause irritation in society, since the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act, and propose new taxes and rules for the super-rich, though they understand that with so much money on the move, actually doing so will be extremely difficult.
However, it is only the number of super-yachts ordered that is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1200 ships, 27 have a length of more than 100 metres.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building the yacht REV Ocean, which is 183 metres long.
After launch, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
There is a "moon pool" on the yacht, as well as a submarine for exploring the depths of the sea.
On existing super-yachts, helicopter pads, open-air cinemas, and even a boxing ring on the McGregor yacht have become commonplace. Professor Richard Wilk, an economic anthropologist at Indiana University, says that compared to the total amount of carbon emissions, the carbon footprint of the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has symbolic significance if you consider that there are slightly more than 2,000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of superfluous consumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the carbon footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than that of an average person on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tonnes of CO2 a year, then the biggest polluter of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tonnes of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission trace fell on his yacht Eclipse, which is 162.5 meters long.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give instructions to sail the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not elicit much sympathy from other people when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no room for their giant ships to dock.
It's also hard to understand her appeal to build marinas for yachts up to 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol, leading to the development of colorectal cancer, has been determined
American scientists have determined how many alcoholic drinks per week increase the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that drinking four or more portions of alcohol in a week is linked to an increased risk of developing cancer.
The likelihood of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
In addition, the risk of developing colon cancer is higher in moderate drinkers than in women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact reason for the development of such cancer, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, if not all, lovers of dogs are convinced that these creatures are very smart.
But even they have no idea how developed four-legged pets actually are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how developed the intelligence of animals is.
Though a dog's vocabulary isn't as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that a dog can understand up to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' work was published in the journal Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, they don't understand politics, economics and art, but they often manage to dupe their owners.
Experts believe that representatives of some breeds show the best results in understanding human language, but there is not enough statistical data to make precise conclusions.
Thus, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and are not inferior to a two-year-old child in their ability to learn.

Ukraine is preparing to trade with the US and Russia
The US and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's accession to NATO, analyst Alexander Kozhevnikov said in his article for the publication "Glavred".
According to him, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations on the guarantees of the United States regarding the fact that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries "to join wherever they want."
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you would not haggle, you would just report the proposer.
And as far as Ukraine is concerned, it's "trade," the analyst wrote.
Kozhevnikov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine and is striving for dialogue with Kiev.
The preparations are carried out secretly, rapidly and immediately switch to offensive actions, without waiting for the group to be discovered and the forces of resistance to be deployed," he noted.
China stimulates development of railway transport sector
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Railway Transportation and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition 2021, held in the city of Zhuzhou, Hunan Province / Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical failures, said the company's representative Hou Zhazheng.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure the reliability and availability of rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its exports of railway transport vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-storey high-speed electric trains developed in China rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd for export to Europe.
These trains will operate at a maximum speed of 200 kilometers per hour on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train, developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey, began.
The train will move along the subway line connecting the center of Istanbul with the airport in the city.
The metro line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
China's railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness, said Feng Yaoshan, head of the Department of Trade and Investment Promotion of the China Committee on Promoting International Trade /CCPIT/.
This sector represents China's main competitive advantage in the global market for high-end equipment, said Feng Yaoshan.
After more than 60 years of intense work, China has created a leading railway equipment manufacturing system with a full range of supporting facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoshan, the country ranks first in terms of electrification of railways and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Goloyashkin in an interview with radio Sputnik listed early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of moderate cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, planning, and reduction of abstract thinking.
At present, there is a discussion about whether hearing loss can be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease or one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the expert said.
Golosheykin stressed that the causes of dementia may be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the cerebral vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that at present doctors do not know effective ways of treating dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, the risk of developing dementia can be reduced by studying foreign languages and active communication.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with the help of games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logical thinking
"There are recommendations on the use of various BADs, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being debated in the scientific community," Goloyshakin said.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies requiring intense involvement of memory and logical thinking," Goloyashkin said.
Earlier, a British charity researching dementia said the disease was affecting more and more people in their 40s.
Doctors named early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign is problems with vision, which makes it difficult for the patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing dementia is aphasia - a condition in which a person cannot find the right words to say what they want to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the panel of doctors set up by the Georgian ombudsman, told journalists.
His neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
The stable problems are problems with mobility, coordination, and character volatility," said the specialist, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and that the ex-president now needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psychological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia, - Toidze noted, requiring that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage the receipt of medical assistance after employees of the penitentiary service subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to cancel the punishment and restore his previous rights.

Protests in Spain against COVID passports
Protests against mandatory vaccination took place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, the Europa Press news agency reports.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action amounted to about 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, the Covid passport has become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, sports halls, retirement homes and night entertainment establishments.
Many protesters came to the action without masks.
The slogans on their placards accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the citizens' choice.
In Valencia, vaccination certificates will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship, calling vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of infection with the coronavirus have been identified since the start of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia also plans to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people.
The government submitted bills on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit places where mass events are held, cultural institutions, objects of public catering and retail trade with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or postponed disease, or a medical certificate of vaccination.
Such rules will be established for trips by train and plane.

A steep climb: how the Chinese are becoming skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create world-class resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to participate in winter sports, which will allow the collection of the 1 trillion yuan indicated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of underdeveloped and remote provinces.
Taivu Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, located not far from the site of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming more and more popular with the Chinese.
In addition to constructing infrastructure in the region, work is being carried out to plant trees: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where the resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide comfortable and interesting holidays at Chinese resorts so that all newbies become regulars.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Adviser to the Games Justin Downs says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every winter more and more Chinese are sent to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite significant changes, it will still take many years to create a ski culture here, Downs said.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
70-year-old Gao Mankong lives in Chunli, not far from the site of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, and now no local residents are unemployed.
More and more stores are opening in the country that sell clothes and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes they are opening points for public catering with dishes of national cuisine.
Taiwan now even has a testing station for COVID-19.
China is striving to create a prosperous winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders of the largest international competitions, and its resorts and equipment must reach the global level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, according to WHO
More than 500 million people worldwide could be plunged into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed progress towards universal health coverage, the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the December 12 International Day of Universal Health Coverage, WHO and the World Bank published two complementary reports.
In them, they stated that the pandemic had led to disruptions in the provision of medical services, and had caused excessive strain on the healthcare system.
In connection with this, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population with immunization decreased, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic had caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s," making it harder for people to pay for treatment.
This situation is pushing more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their pockets."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic had plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people had virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwan's minister was disconnected from the broadcast at the "Summit for Democracy" at the request of the White House
The appearance of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology Audrey Tang at a panel discussion during the U.S.-organized "Summit for Democracy" was translated into a no-video mode, according to a recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters news agency, citing sources, reports that the picture was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to their statement, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from China, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tann was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries around the world by the level of civil rights protection.
Taiwan was marked in green as "free", while China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were marked in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture from her side was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government."
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
According to Reuters sources, the map shown by the Taiwanese minister could contradict Washington's "one China" policy.
One source in the agency said that after the map was shown, the U.S. National Security Council became angry and called the State Department, accusing it of treating Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Summit for Democracy" was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
At the "zero day" summit, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained via corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council, Yuri Averianov, stated that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

China is strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where there are land entry points
The State Council of the People's Republic of China has issued a circular, ordering to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where there are land ports, in a bid to further prevent the import of the virus from overseas.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative result of the test for nucleic acids of COVID-19 obtained within 48 hours before departure.
Those arriving in cities where there are land border crossing points must undergo at least one test for COVID-19 nucleic acids upon arrival.
The document says the requirements will apply from the date that the relevant provincial-level administrative units designate and publish the zones of the cities in question until March 15, 2022.
It is also noted that cities, in which there are land customs points and which meet certain conditions, may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

In the MID they spoke about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the USA
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov evaluated the prospects of the Moscow-Washington relations in an interview with "Izvestia".
He noted that the long path of interaction led to sad conclusions, and problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
One-sided negative predictability exists, but in terms of some prospect of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
It's a sad commentary on the long journey we've traveled with this administration, and with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not begin yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Riyabkov, the problem is that the United States is trying to impose on Russia approaches to a number of issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he did not dare to give optimistic forecasts about the prospects of improving relations and did not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, there has been no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to act responsibly on issues of international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and that Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated at a meeting with American Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow is ready to resume dialogue with the US.
Virologist warns of the dangers of nasal vaccination from COVID outside hospitals
Those who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 may experience an allergic reaction and require medical assistance. Therefore, the first points for vaccination with this preparation should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by the TASS virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of the Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize points of vaccination with a nasal vaccine in airports and shopping centers, but I would do this only in medical institutions at first.
The thing is that the probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine exists, it is small, but it is desirable that a person sit next to the doctor's office after this.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy drugs that work in literally a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when there is experience in using the preparation.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine it is important that it gets into the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
There is also a risk that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person being vaccinated sneezes after the injection.

Serbia produced 2 million doses of the "Sputnik V" vaccine
The "Sputnik V" vaccine is the most popular in Serbia.

Then the police stopped us.
The column was organized, and their car broke down.
It needs to be towed.

In the UK, 1,239 cases of the omega strain of the coronavirus were recorded in a day - RT in Russian
In the UK, 1,239 cases of infection with the new omicron strain of the coronavirus were identified over the past day.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the "omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with the new strain of COVID-19 in the UK has reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted in a pessimistic forecast that 75,000 people could die in England by April due to the coronavirus outbreak caused by the "omikron" strain.
Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that introduce anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continuing "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including the alleged "invasion" of the country.
It is impossible to introduce some restrictions against Russia and not to suffer yourself - said the official representative of the Kremlin in the air of the "Russia 1" TV channel.
Peskov asserts that this "is understood by everyone in the world."
Earlier, it was reported that the US is considering imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the EU plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, head of Sberbank German Gref is sure that this is impossible.

Remember that children under the age of 3-5 still have open channels of communication with the subtle world, and the child may know more than you!)
Residents of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported by the French TV channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% voted against independence.
3.51% of the population of the archipelago in the south of the Pacific Ocean supported independence from France.
Annulled the results of 2.99% of the ballots.
The level of participation in voting on this day was very low: about 55% of the population of the archipelago came to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by calls from separatists to boycott the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
Most residents supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
Some 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has a special administrative and territorial status.
There is an agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia from 1998, according to which the region can hold a referendum on its independence twice with a difference of two years.

WHO preliminarily considers "omikron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily believes that "omikron" is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there are data on the decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in the case of a new variant of COVID-19.
According to information on December 9, "omikron" is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic protein profile of the "omikron" strain allow us to assume a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against the infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary data from South Africa, it is expected that it ("the severity of the disease") may be less severe than with "delta", - says the technical report of WHO.
The organization notes that all registered cases of infection with "omikron" in the EU are currently mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, according to preliminary data, the new strain is spreading faster than "delta".
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They had been "previously vaccinated," the Gamaleya Center said.
Head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova stated that there is no reliable information about the new coronavirus being less dangerous than the others.

Four scenarios for Zelensky have been named in Ukraine
Ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
According to him, the head of state may remain without support from the West, as well as possibly make compromises on Donbass.
This was reported by Denisenko on Sunday, December 12, in an article on the "Glavred" portal.
The first version, which Denisenko called "an ideal storm," assumes that Ukraine will stop supporting key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
At the same time, there is a reduction in prices for key goods that we traditionally export... There are also internal protests and resistance to the authorities from key FPGs (financial-industrial groups). - The ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in case of high turbulence in global politics, when Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Under such circumstances, the Ukrainian leadership may make compromises on Donbass, which could lead to confrontation within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position was weakened, with a probability of such a situation of 50-55%, according to the former MP.
The third scenario for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation between groups of the population that disagree with Zelensky and the president, which can lead to the capture of control over the power block and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
In this scenario, Zelensky will start "reshaping power," Denisenko added.
Another scenario - the transformation of Zelensky into "the father of the nation".
This may be due to some event which will be a strong shock for the society.
The event should be sufficiently large-scale to provoke a response from external partners and increase support for Ukraine, Denisenko said.
This scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological catastrophe or aggressive actions by Russia, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is precisely the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record low levels, making up 19.3%.
This is the lowest rating since he became head of state.
Analysts predicted that in the event of the nearest presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for ex-President Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, only 19.3% of those surveyed expressed support for the president.

Thank you for the story about the great athlete, I didn't know that Elena Shushunova died, it's very sad to find out.
I remember how I cheered for her at the Olympics in Seoul, and for us, residents of Primorskiy Kray, this was a live broadcast, real time.
There was so much passion, emotions were running high, I remember the joy when Elena won.
We were also delighted with the other victories, as we cheered for Salnikov, for the footballers, for all the Soviet athletes at the time.
I saw a documentary on TV about one of the Central American countries, and they were loading pineapples onto the ship in barrels.
The pumpkins were huge.
I have worked on harvesting and loading pumpkins in the Astrakhan region many times in my youth, and have never seen pumpkins weighing more than a pound.
I buy pumpkins weighing 4-5 kg straight from the garden and not earlier than the beginning of August.

The lower part of the cup is reinforced with a non-elastic transparent fabric.
The lateral internal part of the cup, in the area of the stitching of the bra, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is precisely this element that allows you not to stretch the lace.
The wealth of embroidery can be appreciated by the feast on the line of décolleté and under the breast.
The vertical fibres in the side panels made from one-layer microfibre do not allow the fabric to twist on a large scale.

Poet arrested for action on Red Square: "For a quote from Evtushenko, they give you 10 days, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student of the Higher School of Economics was detained on Red Square with a poster, on which was written the hashtag #poetrussia.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander for an administrative offence of repeat violation of the procedure for holding a public event.
He was detained for the first time on January 23 on Pushkin Square at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
The goal was to attract attention to poetry as a whole: unfortunately, interest in it has nowadays been lost in Russia, and there is a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their verses and use this hashtag, explains Alexander.
We spoke to the young poet to find out the circumstances of his arrest and to delve more deeply into the meaning of his message.
How were you treated by the police when you were detained this time and earlier?
What did they ask in the department and how did they comment on your action?
This time the employees were more correct, the detention was maximum, polite, as if it sounded funny in some context of this word.
At Pushkin Square they took OMON officers and took them without mercy.
They asked the standard questions about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
Apart from the ventilated orangutan, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew where this was going.
And if after the action under this hashtag start writing their poems, even a few people, I will not sit idly for 10 days.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak to each other in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events they speak in the language of the surroundings, so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian perfectly and still uses an interpreter.
And at official events, a stenograph is taken down by hand, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.

Thanks to its high content of fiber, it is useful for the digestive system, and regular use may also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for maximum benefit, the root vegetable is best stewed or boiled, rather than fried in oil.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, just like other high-glycemic index foods.
These are products containing carbohydrates that break down quickly into sugars, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic drinks, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in their production in personal subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the current shortage of products can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates removed from "Yandex"
Candidates for departure
In 2015, right holders from the RAEK/Media cluster made a list of 100 largest pirate websites in Russia and most of them have ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, the Director of the Institute for Internet Research.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - have managed to survive thanks, among other things, to regular changes of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in search results as both "Yandex" and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Game of Clans" and "Tenderness," directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series from the largest video service in Russia (AIV).
Kinogo, which is also available to searchers, allows you to watch the animated novelty "Enkanto", but judging by the quality of the video, it is a so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the TV series "Univers. 10 years later" of the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-media") is available.

Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, "Actual Camera" reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions starting in five years is to assess the suitability of Venus clouds for life, and then search for life there.
Tartu scientists have developed instruments for measuring the acidity and oxygen content of Venus clouds for the project.
It was previously thought that Venus' clouds were too acidic for life to exist, but it is likely that Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Assuming that we find life there, the main question will be - is it similar to life on Earth or is it different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that life on Earth did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, it is possible that life originated on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project, Mikhkel Pajusalu.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The theme of metaverses became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Therefore, business in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in creating their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
It is necessary to regard metaphysics as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend for creating remote interactions in the conditions of the pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the one hand, this is the result of businesses' desire to develop ecosystems and adapt their business models to them.
The third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to digital format.
Anna, you are right, changing the diet is a conscious process.

You can eat it by the spoonful, taste it - and that's enough.
After all, there are ten days ahead, and you can prepare any tasty and useful dishes.

British economist could not give forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022, as he believes such attempts will end in failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the situation.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, while inflation ranks second, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the increase in prices for goods was temporary or not.
As an expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of central bank infinite generosity has run its course" and it is time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking into account inflation, will correlate with expected GDP growth.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, continuation of ultra-soft economic policies could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the issue of productivity growth, as well as increasing poverty and changing climate, O'Nill summarized.
Earlier, head of the global research department "Open Investment" Mikhail Shulgin said that positive expectations for the dollar in 2022 remain, while potential growth will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar, Shulgin named monetary policy of the Fed, dynamics of oil prices and concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Forced to agree.
But there is one thing to be happy about: if you compare yourself with yourself, there were fewer containers five years ago.

Russians gave dealers around 4.5% of the country's GDP
At the end of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 78.4 billion rubles on purchasing new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period of the previous year, according to the statistical data of the agency Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - approximately the same sum (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the pandemic.
At the meeting of heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that such a sum is equivalent to more than 4.5% of the country's GDP in 2020.
On the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is in the lead.
In the first 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars for a total of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than in the same period last year.
The Hyundai brand's relative, Kia, saw its sales increase even more - by more than 35%, and revenue from car sales was valued at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is in the lead in terms of increasing the average price of a car - over the year it grew by almost 21% to 19.4 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had a stronger price increase dynamics.
At the same time, sales of Korean brands did not increase significantly: according to the statistics of the Committee of Automobile Manufacturers of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars than in the same period last year.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Toyota closed the top three by sales volume in monetary terms. Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand over 10 months, which is 14% more than a year ago.
Mercedes-Benz follows in second place with 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand's sales volume grew by 37%, and the average cost of a car also increased by almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles.
Mercedes-Benz is currently observing good growth in sales and the average price - more, for example, than at BMW - which is why financial capacity is growing more strongly, explained Tatyana Arbatskaya, Director of NAPI. -
Fantastic growth rates in sales are being demonstrated by Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year."
Russia's Lada demonstrated medium-paced growth in terms of revenue (plus 28%), and Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand over 10 months.
At the level of the previous year, there are companies whose sales in units in 2021 fell: for example, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in the red - for 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on off-road vehicles and pickups of this brand, versus 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with deliveries of auto components and disruptions in production, affecting the entire global automotive industry, auto companies continue to make continuous price corrections - the same "AvtoVAZ" raised the price of Lada models seven times over the year, the last increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
They regularly revise their prices for their products and other car manufacturers.
The volume of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to grow - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation and car manufacturers' desire to recoup past losses are also contributing to this, experts believe.
In conditions of a shortage of cars, I think that many car companies have even been able to shift some of the costs of previous periods to consumers, which they were not able to include in the price of cars earlier,
says analyst Vladimir Bespalov from VTB Capital.
I think that in financial terms, car manufacturers feel themselves to be in a very strong position, with high marginality of sales."
This is indirectly evidenced by the growth rates of car prices, which are expected in 2021, the expert says.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative and monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
As the supply of opportunities to increase prices grows, their availability will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian automotive market will continue to grow even in the next year, even if the growth rate of the cost of vehicles slows down, automotive manufacturers will be able to receive their income due to volumes, says independent automotive consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, auto manufacturers are now striving to get the biggest profit from each sold car, says Burgazliyev. -
An increase in the volume of production of machines is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the hype is also fueled by uncertainty among citizens about the future.
Against the backdrop of the current market situation, cars have become a good investment object - a car purchased a year ago can now be sold for more than its initial cost, an expert concludes.
Biden spoke about the transfer of US troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in case of "invasion" by Russia.
This statement was made by the President of the United States Joe Biden.
“Never before have there been such plans,” the head of the White House said in reply to a journalist’s question about whether the USA had rejected such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops in a unilateral way to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the US will deploy forces to Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Estonia).
We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those countries that we have a sacred obligation to defend from any attack by Russia - said Biden.
Earlier, press secretary of the Russian president Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intention to invade Ukraine.
At the same time, he indicated that Moscow considers the problem to be Kiev's use of drones supplied by Turkey for military purposes, as well as the fact that "American weapons are getting closer to our territory."

If a scammer calls from such a number, for example, "an employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another law enforcement agency, it is ineffective to hang up immediately, and it is unlikely to be included in the black list.
Because to confirm his lie about the involvement in the power structures, he quickly repeats the call and continues to scare and persuade.

Film by student Alexander Sokurov received European "Oscar" for best editing
Nominated for an Oscar, the Russian film "Punching the Clock" has won the award of the European Film Academy (also known as the "European Oscar") in the "Best Editing" category, reports "Moskovsky Komsomolets".
The jury of the competition, voting online due to the complicated epidemiological situation, evaluated the outstanding mastery of the creators of the film.
The maximum number of awards went to the film "Where Are You Going, Aida?" by Jasmila Zbanic (Bosnia and Herzegovina).
The main character of the film is a translator for the UN mission who tries to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama "Crushing Blows," directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's master class), this film is about the complex relationship between a powerful father and his grown-up children who want to break free from parental control in North Ossetia.
Earlier it was announced that this film was nominated for the "Oscar" award as the best film shot in a foreign language.
