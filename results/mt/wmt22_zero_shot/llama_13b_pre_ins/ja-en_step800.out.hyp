I don't really feel like watching TV because of that...
Isn't it ridiculous for a talento to become a TV personality?
Yesterday, I watched the anime "Iroha" on Netflix, but there were many scenes where the staff laughed from behind when I said something uninteresting.
There is no doubt that it is quite amusing to say that "I am saying this because I am an entertainer" in a quite obvious way.
However, if the staff don't smile, the artist's displeasure will spread, and the job will become unpleasant.
Once upon a time, the entertainment industry was as segregated as black-owned businesses, and the egos of some celebrities were as inflated and off-putting as racist tendencies.
On the other hand, the fact that entertainers themselves are proud of their job and talk about "how to support entertainers" one after another is also amazing.
Although the income is quite small until it becomes possible to sell, it is said that the job of an entertainer is a top-class job.
There is no justification for the legitimization of the exaggerated presence of celebrities and the beautification of their careers in the media and society.
I'm frankly saying that there are some parts of my job that are quite tough, but when I touch the entertainment world, I feel like it's becoming more and more unreasonable.
I'm sorry for what I said.
I felt that my body would be better off if I didn't go outside...

Merchandise ordered at Tsukumo Net Shop was carelessly exchanged
Summary: If you order a wireless mouse and feel relieved, the wired version of the mouse you ordered will arrive, and if you hope to return it, you will be told to send it back.
It's not just the trouble with availability that makes the topic of self-made PCs, but it's still worth writing about it.
The discovery that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was sold for 3,280 yen (excluding tax) at the one-day sale of the Tsukumo Net Shop, which started from the previous Golden Week, was a sensation.
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I also checked the page of the wired version, which was 5,071 yen (Rinku Town), and I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake.
The order mail came normally, and the shipping mail came on the next day.
The name of "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT" was written in the purchase record of my page and these two emails.
Since there was no mistake in the delivery from the order to the cancellation notice, the wireless mouse ordered was expected to arrive at this point.
There was a problem with the delivery from here, and an email saying "there was a difference in the registration of the goods" came a few hours later.
According to the email
It was sold at a discount as a wireless version, but it was actually a wired version.
Since it has already shipped the wired mouse,
1. Refusal of acceptance and total cancellation
2. Return the mouse only for a refund
3. Using a wired mouse
Choose your response
The merchandise pages are separated into wired and wireless versions, and even the purchase record and mail are written in the wireless version, so it seems that it is carelessly replaced with the wired version.
I bought the goods without knowing the difference between what I bought and what I didn't buy, and if I return it, will it not be too cold from here?
So, I'd like to ask for your cooperation in receiving the money at last.
Do you think it's hard to get along with a bad person when you're dating and looking for a partner?

Alone for the second time... The only bridge connecting the region is washed away by Typhoon Trami and torrential rain The residents have tripled their emergency food supplies <v>-</v> Fukushima, Japan (Fukushima Television) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Matsumoto, who lives in the highland region of Jari, Fukushima Prefecture.
What had a major impact on the living of 8 people in the 3rd generation was the East Japan Typhoon in 2019.
Motonobu Matsumoto said, "At first, I felt like 'Wow'.
I was so worried that the bridge would be broken or washed away by the flood" The only road connecting the highland region, "Highland Bridge," was washed away by the tsunami in East Japan, and 30 people in the 11th band of the region became isolated.
Residents who had their water supply cut off were forced to carry out their daily activities using the JR railway, to which passage was not generally permitted.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "If it is an ordinary case, the police will come to the scene by car. So, I felt the inconvenience of traffic means and the difficulty of cars. The emergency bridge completed in one month was isolated again for several days because of the heavy rain that lasted for more than 3 months.
It has been two years since the disaster, but Matsumoto continues his countermeasures.
Mr. Matsumoto said, "I think there are 10 cases.
First of all, I would like to ensure the safety of anything on the 2nd and 3rd." Food that can be used for cooking, such as ramen and canned food, is about three times more abundant than before the disaster.
Ms. Matsumoto said, "I didn't know whether the disaster would strike me at any time, so I'm relieved to have a little reserve and do something for others." On the other hand, Yaizu Town, which has experienced "unexpected disasters" in which the bridge was washed away.
Starting from 2021, in order not to forget the lesson, the town has made its own efforts.
Takayama City, Education Department, Gokayama Ryuichi, Director: "We have scheduled the day for the prevention of disasters in Takayama City as 'Disaster Prevention Day in Takayama City'. We would like to think about the preparations for the prevention of disasters on October 12 every year from now on. An announcement has also been made.
I think that the awareness that unexpected things can happen has increased compared to before."

The collapse of the "building condition survey system" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
● Aiming at the activation of the second-hand housing market Newly established "building condition survey" system The second-hand housing transaction is prosperous.
The price of building a house and that of a mansion has risen, and the reformed market is also inclined to expand.
While the trend of people staying home is on the rise due to the Covid-19 pandemic, words such as "in front of the station," "near the station," and "directly connected to the station," as well as "large-scale" and "tower" represent properties that are popular and relatively inexpensive new properties are also on the rise.
【View the images of this article】 Compared with overseas, however, the existing (used) housing circulation in Japan is still at a low level.
For this reason, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) revised part of the House Building Transaction Business Act in 2018, and started a building status survey targeting the transaction of safe and secure secondhand homes, called inspection (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common / 001219900.pdf).
This is a system for notifying the buyer of the status and condition of the building, including the deterioration of the building, based on the inspection of the construction engineer who is familiar with the residence.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
The seller was able to avoid the claim for compensation after the sale by having the property inspected before the sale, which made the buyer feel reassured.
This is what leads to the differentiation of competing products.
On the other hand, from the viewpoint of the buyer, it is a system in which the state of the second-hand housing to be purchased can be grasped and purchased at a discount, and it is said that it is a great system at first glance.
In the current system, the main responsibility for conducting building condition surveys lies with the sellers.
In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the fact that only the notification of the inspection system has become mandatory.
In other words, real estate agents, who are responsible for mediation, are required to explain whether they can "introduce architects who survey the building conditions at the time of real estate mediation" or not. However, the implementation of this obligation is not mandatory.
● Leading the inspection of the seller's risk concerns On the other hand, when looking overseas, in active markets such as the United States and Britain, similar systems have already been established.
In the preliminary stage of the housing sale, the system requires the buyer to entrust the building inspection to specialists who are called "inspectors" and "building surveyors".
For example, in the case of the United States, 70 to 90% of inspections of used housing transactions are carried out by states.
In terms of the fact that the "buyer" has led the inspection so far, the Japanese-style inspection of the "seller" main is greatly different in nature.
The seller tries to show the condition of the building as much as possible, as high as possible, and sell it as soon as possible.
On the other hand, the buyers are considering living in the house after repairing it based on the survey results.
Even if it is the same inspection, the purpose and intentions of both sides are different.
As a result, the following points have been pointed out as risks to Japan's system.
The scope of the survey of the inspection of the sales leader model designated by the country is limited to the minimum.
Since there was no detailed survey, there is a risk of falling into important inconveniences. ● For the inspection company, the mediating company (seller) who introduces the responsible case to the company can be said to be a customer.
As a result, there is a possibility that the inspection, which does not report favorable survey results to the seller, is carried out

Was Ginza an island?
Silver Bracelet Speaks 5 Languages (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
Well, it used to be half an island.
As for the evidence ... ... it's amazing how little it takes to impress some people.
Introducing the fascinating bean knowledge in Ginza that makes you want to talk to someone.
Go up to Ginza!
Entering the golden seat for the first time
As you walk around Ginza, you can find the remains of the history carved in the area such as the place names with changing winds, mysterious stone monuments, and a lot of time-honored shops.
Walking while talking with her in Ginza, I unintentionally stopped in front of a silent store.
Did Ginza used to be a peninsula?
The name "Ginza" has become a metonym for bustling shopping streets in cities all over Japan, including Tokyo's Ginza district.
Originally, "Ginza" was the name of the mint where silver coins were made. In 1612 (the 17th year of Keicho), the Ginza Magistrate's Office, which was located in the current city of Shizuoka, was transferred to Edo.
At that time, it was called "Shinryōyamachi", but when it was transferred to Ginza, it was called by the nickname "Ginza".
Incidentally, in the vicinity of Ginza, there was a "peninsula" that jutted out into the sea.
Prior to the Edo era, the area from Nihonbashi to Marunouchi was reclaimed from the river, and a half island called "Edo no Shima" stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of that peninsula is currently in Ginza.
Tokugawa Ieyasu established the shogunal government in Edo, dug the moat around Edo, and developed the area around Nihonbashi.
Furthermore, Komeito renovated the streets and promoted the development of water transportation.
It dug the moat, cut down the hill of Godaidani, and buried the river.
In front of the Tiffany & Co. main store in Ginza (Ginza 2-7, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument indicating the site of Ginza Police Station, so it would be interesting to see which direction your curiosity takes you.
Knowing people, knowing Ginza's "sacred pilgrimage"
In Ginza, there is a "Ginza Hachiman Shrine Parade" known as a "sacred place pilgrimage" that is held every year.
Among the 10 or more holy places, the most eye-catching is probably the "Singing and Dancing Shrine" in front of the Singing and Dancing Pavilion.
There are fewer and fewer people attending the performance.
On the other hand, "Longguang Unmovable Zhen" is on the roof of the Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Birthplace Zhen" is on the 9th floor of the Ginza Terasu in Ginza.
The "Shinmeigu Shrine" and the "Azuma Inari Shrine" and the "Toriiwa Inari Shrine" are located in a quiet place in the roadside, and they are not so noticeable. However, the "Toriiwa Inari Shrine," which is famous for the excellence of its dance and music, is known for the fact that the "Successful Inari Shrine" in the Ginza Bldg. 1F entrance is not open to the public except around the Yotsuya Shrine.
Around this shrine, there are places that worship Fudomyo-o and Jizou, but most of the shrines worship Inari.
The "Inari Shrine" that foxes welcomed in front of the shrine is located in a place where there are many farmers, and it is said that it was built on the premise that farmers have the benefit of a good harvest of "five crops and a rich harvest".
As a result, in cities like Kyoto and Edo, which were prosperous and bustling with trade, it was said that there was great benefit to be gained from trade, and even in bustling streets and Ginza in Tokyo, the faith spread.

POSCO International, a subsidiary of Korean steel giant POSCO, has acquired the Senex Energy project in Queensland, Australia, and expanded its overseas gas field development business - Korean report (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
POSCO International announced on the 12th that it had concluded investment contracts with Senex Energy for the acquisition of shares and with Hancock Energy and Senex Energy for the acquisition of shares.
At present, there are procedures such as the resolution of the shareholders' meeting of Senex Energy and the approval of the local corporation. The acquisition procedure is scheduled to be completed in March next year.
This acquisition is the largest M&A case in the world since Posco International was integrated into the Posco Group in 2010.
The acquisition cost was 77.09 billion yen, of which 50.1% was invested by POSCO International and 49.9% by Hancock Energy.
POSCO International said that the demand for natural gas continues to increase even in the era of energy transformation, and that the blue hydrogen based on natural gas is co-dividing the market with green hydrogen in the hydrogen market. It explained that it has decided to buy and sell this time.
POSCO International said that with this acquisition, the company has secured 8020 million cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas storage capacity, which accounts for 44% of the country's natural gas consumption in 2019. The company also ensured the employment of local workers at the onshore gas field in Gwangyang.

That pain in your knee, maybe it's "osteoarthritis"!?
Different treatments for different reasons (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editorial Department: Recently, my knee has been hurting.
What kind of illness is possible?
Mr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain are various, such as knee osteoarthritis and synovial inflammation.
Moreover, many Japanese suffer from "deforming joint disease".
Editorial Department: Is it because the joint is deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Originally, the surface of the joint was covered with cartilage, absorbing shocks and lubricating the movement of the joint.
Unfortunately, gaining weight and obesity, as well as intense sports, are the causes of osteoporosis.
As a result, the joint was deformed and inflamed.
Editing Department: Is transforming arthritis limited to the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints and tendons of the fingers, wrist, waist, ankle, and big toe.
However, the most common cause is osteoarthritis, which is called "deforming osteoarthritis of the knee."
Editing Department: What kind of structure does the joint have?
Mr. Marusan: The joint is formed by the concave and convex of two bones.
And the part where the two bones face each other is covered with "articular cartilage", while the surrounding bone is wrapped in a "joint capsule".
Editing Department: It's a complicated structure.
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
The inner layer of the joint capsule is lined with a membrane called the synovial membrane, which produces joint fluid.
This synovial fluid acts as a lubricant, and is composed of hyaluronic acid and condroitin sulfate.
It is said that glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are good for lubricating the joints.
Editing Department: What kind of symptoms occur when you have a transforming joint disease?
Mr. Maruyama: The cartilage is elastic and has elasticity. It plays a role in preventing direct bone-to-bone contact.
Well, it's like a cameo.
However, if this is attenuated or distorted, or if it causes inflammation by deforming the joint, it will cause pain.

Actually experiencing the "Kaiji" series gambling & game 3 selections (real sound) - Yahoo! News
The explosively popular manga "Kaiji," which focuses on male characters.
One of the charms of this work is that there is a game of life and death.
【Photograph】 Just looking at it makes me want to put my feet up... Challenge the iron skeleton crossing!
So, this time, we would like to examine the games that can actually be played, or the games that are practiced in the animation.
The pachinko machine "Muun" that appeared in the TV anime "Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji" is full of traps.
In the original work, a ball cost 4000 yen at a high rate.
This "quagmire" had a big trap of "Pin's Forest", "movable fortifications" and "three-section crucifix". It was almost impossible to attack.
Kaiji, however, used every trick in the book, sinking the floor of the building with a vinyl-made water tank in the end.
The "swamp" that appeared in Cage is actually a pinball, and many people are playing it.
Of course, things like "one drink for 4000 yen" do not exist, and the difficulty has been lowered, but it should be possible to taste the mood of Kai.
The "Star Side Party" where the debtors including Kai were implemented was the "iron-bone crossing" of the "human horse racing".
While working on the assumption that the debtor would not fall from the 10-meter-high steel frame installed on the ground, they competed in speed.
Twelve people took part and the top two won prizes, but there were only four skeletons, the safety measures were not enough and the risk of death was relatively high.
This iron bridge has a high level of danger, but in addition to being developed as a VR game, you can get a close experience of it at the "Eggleston Bridge" set up in "Ryutan Seimei Park Miyagi," the home field of professional baseball Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.
This Eggleston Bridge has a height of 20 meters (equivalent to 7 floors of a building), and a single-arch bridge made of iron is built at this site, and "Sky Bridge" and "Victory Bridge" are prepared at its head.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Corea Coala, who has her own YouTube channel, posted a video of herself walking across the bridge and saying, "The Iron Bridge can be experienced in Japan," and became a hot topic.
■ E-Card, a two-player card game.
10 cards are used, including 1 card of the emperor, 8 cards of the citizens, and 1 card of the slaves. The slaves are placed on one side of the emperor, and the citizens are placed on the other side.
This game is very well done, the emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against slaves, and slaves are strong against the emperor.
Kaiji fights against the current of the River Kai with a strict rule in the movie that "he will cut off his own ear if he loses".
Kaiji, who seemed to have read the psychology by sensing and transmitting the change of heart rate and body temperature such as palpitation and fever with the device that destroys the eardrum as hard as an iPhone, won by confusing the roots of the river by cutting his own eardrum to an abnormal value.
The E-Card can be purchased from retailers such as Amazon.
YouTube has uploaded a video of Hikaru, a popular YouTuber, defeating Fujimura Ryu, also a YouTuber, in a card game, which has become a hot topic.
■Would you like to try Kaiji's mood?
No one wants to be caught in a predicament like Kaiji's, but it's also a fact that reading a manga can make one feel a bit better.
Try to feel the world view through the game.
A step towards the new year, and a kind farewell to the deity of the prefecture at Kashima Jingu Shrine｜Mountain News
As preparations for the New Year are in progress at the prefectural guardian shrine (Yamagata City), the great picture horse of the 2021 zodiac animal, "Tora" (Tiger), was displayed.
On the 11th, design students from Tohoku University of Art and Design visited the shrine and held a ceremony in front of the gods.
The shrine has been requesting the original paintings of horses from the art students since last year.
This time, the work of Yu Ishii, a 22-year-old student of the Japanese painting course at Musashino Art University, which was led by Professor Ming Ming was selected.
The painting is 3.3 meters wide and the height of the center is about 1.8 meters.
Towaya described it as "an image of a new year with cherry blossoms in the back."
Standing still and looking at the cherry blossom, the posture of Tran, who wished "to keep the beauty of nature in a rapidly changing world," was included.
Towaya's design is depicted on the general picture of horses.
Gon Nenji, a 44-year-old man in Chiba, said, "I think I'm doing my part to help everyone win the difficult battle."

Let's think about "continuing to live in Tamano" Proposal to the city for four high school workshops: Yamaguchi Newspaper Digital | san-deji
What kind of town will Tama be in 2030?
Student representatives from four universities and colleges in Tsuyama City are participating in a workshop to discuss "Tsuyama that I want to continue to live in."
As a part of the survey and policy proposal activities of the intermediate support organization "Tamano SDGs Miracle Center", we will summarize the voices of young people and propose them to the mayor.
It's always fun.
In response to the Facilitator's question, the students answered, "When I'm with a lot of people," "When I'm drumming," and so on.
It was held for the first time on November 13 at Sunshine City.
Eighteen university students and people in the region talked about "a town where you feel like living," "a town where you feel like staying," and "a town that makes you feel alive" while moving the "island" that each of them had determined as the theme.
Each idea was written on a sticky note and arranged on the modeling paper.
A town with many young people is interesting. "You can't do without trains and buses for the convenience."
There are no common points, and we should talk more.
Though I had thought that Tsumara was unbeatable, the charm is that it is possible to cycle around the seashore, said Tsumara High School third-year student (18) (translated from Japanese).
The 18-year-old third-year student of Bungo High School said, "There aren't many shops, and the transportation is inconvenient, but it's good that there are plenty of nature," and talked about the charm of the region, not only the problems in the area.
The second meeting in December was attended by high school students only, and the content of the proposal was sorted out.
It is scheduled to be announced by the mayor and the education chief next February.
The chairperson of the center's board of directors said, "It is important to cultivate the attachment of college students to their hometowns, and it is also important for young people to take the lead in revitalizing local industries."

The discovery of a new way to stall (Nikkei news) - Yahoo! News
It is indispensable in winter, but it is not so in summer.
It is good to adjust the balance while looking at the folded mirror, but now I don't know where to start.
When I saw the cloth, I thought there must be something new.
The sturdy of the brand "COTTORI (Cotton)" is about 1 meter in length and the size is more compact than the general one.
When I first saw it, I thought, "It can't be that short, can it?"
In fact, it seems that one piece of cloth with delicate patterns is skillfully put together, which makes the whole piece look like a spider web.
The end of the tunnel is in sight.
So, even if you don't connect both ends, you can leave it wound up.
The material is very light and warm.
This year, even without sleeves, the jersey is popular, but many people wear it in combination with a jacket to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it's convenient to have such a stroller.

The documentary of Beatles coming to Disney Plus is beyond amazing
Peter Jackson, who directed the movie, was there
It's a fresh and lively beat that makes me feel like I'm alive...
Because it was just before the dissolution, Gisaburō did his best, but it was not as dramatic as I had imagined.
John, who was trying his best while saying, "I get it, I guess!", Paul, who was a little slow in the uptake and said, "Well...", George, who had a languid air about him and said things in a roundabout way, and John, who was always slow in the uptake and said things in a roundabout way, and the ringo that was so sour it clashed with the rest of the dish... The more I ate, the more I thought, "Hmm, this is pretty good."
So, I didn't want to be in a situation where I hated each other so much that we couldn't even be in the same room, but there was definitely that vibe of, "Well, we might as well carry on working together," which is amazing when you think about it, because it's such a cliché when bands break up and say, "We still remain the best of friends."
And then, when the performance begins in such an atmosphere, everyone can really enjoy it
There was a process of going from a little phrase to asking "What's that song?" to "That song" taking on a life of its own.
In particular, the moment when the title character Get Buck shines is great.
It's amazing how the catchy melody of "Sarigenai Fun Fun Fūn" gradually enters the lyrics of "Zucha♪Zucha♪"
It is amazing to see the process of composition in such a way.
I'm so happy just to be able to watch the performance scene
Even in the third episode, there was only one episode, but the biggest reason for the dissolution at this time was the impression that the environment around Beatles was more important than Beatles itself.
The four of us were so happy to be able to start making music together, but where do we do the live? When we talked about it, some producers and promoters were saying, "Yeah, Beatles are the best in the world!" and we realized that it was easier to say that our hands were tied than to do it ourselves.
However, since the documentary is also interpreted by the director, it is not surprising that Peter Jackson felt that way...
I thought that since Paul was being supervised by Paul, there were many scenes where Paul was bad.

Major damage in the US from Hurricane Sandy (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the night of the 10th (Friday) to the 11th (Saturday) local time, tornadoes erupted in the southern United States.
At this time, a strong cold front has descended on the record warmth, and the state of the air has become very unstable due to the influence of strong cold air, and it is expected that the cloud will develop rapidly.
Warm air flowed in from the southwest in the southern United States, and record high temperatures were recorded.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperature on the 9th (Tuesday, local time) and 10th (Wednesday) was close to 30℃.
In such a warm and record-breaking place, a strong cold front with a temperature of less than -30℃ at an altitude of 5,500m has moved southward, resulting in the formation of an active front with a large temperature difference. The cloud along the front has developed rapidly.
It is suspected that the quake occurred around it.
The southern United States is an area where tornadoes are likely to occur, but most of the cases of large damage occur in the transition from spring to summer.
The dragonfly police report released on January 1 reached 150 times close to the record.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center reported 400-plus whirlwinds and tornadoes just on Thursday (local time).
According to this, there are two concentrated areas in the south of the line from Kentucky to Texas and in the north of the line including Illinois.
In Kumamoto Prefecture, the EF scale (Kumamoto scale) indicating the strength of the quake reached EF3, which is the third strongest level among the six levels, and a sudden gust of 70 m/s before and after was felt.
In future surveys, there is also a possibility of being judged as EF4-5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version of Renewal Fujita scale) adjusted to the state of Japanese buildings based on the Renewal Fujita scale is used.
The magnitude 6.0 earthquake that hit America's East Coast this time was followed by JEF3, which has a high possibility of occurring in Japan.

Calls for a live broadcast from beneath the "biggest" whirlpool in history (Sports Nippon) - Yahoo! News
Regarding the damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on August 11 (August 12, Japan time), "One of the largest dragons in the history of the United States."
As reported by CNN and others.
Biden emphasized that "as a federal government, we will do everything."
The full extent of the damage, including how many people were killed, was not known, he said.
The number of deaths has exceeded 100.
【Photos】 In Kentuck, which suffered from the tornado, a resident is carrying household goods along the damaged house to the road after the tornado On the night of August 10, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least 6 states, including Kentuck, from dusk to before dawn.
The 1925 record of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) in Mississippi is the farthest-reaching damage from a single tornado on record, but CNN meteorologists estimate this one was about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers) long and up to 1 mile (1.61 kilometers) wide.
In the large-scale disaster-stricken prefecture of Kumamoto, the factory that had worked 24 hours a day in preparation for Christmas sales was also greatly damaged.
At that time, 110 people were working there, but the building was destroyed and there was no trace left.
In the darkness, a woman who had lost the ability to move her legs due to the thickness of about 1.5 meters under the gravel, felt the weight of the rescuers searching for the gravel on her back, and appealed for help from the Facebook live broadcast from the smartphone.
In addition to the female screams calling for help in the live broadcast, the sound of "Happy Birthday to You," which was sung in tears as other women screamed in horror, also reverberated.
Anthony Brown, who lives at the convenience store where he works in Mayfield, credits an Amber Alert with saving his 5-year-old son and hiding him in the basement of their home.

It is an old saying that the evaluation system of the star system is different.
While other countries are reducing their carbon footprints based on the Paris Agreement's target of five degrees Celsius, Japan claims that it will increase/decrease its carbon footprint based on the target of three degrees Celsius.
At the reference point, there is already a difference of two stars, and the four stars are "different in terms of the presence or absence of key elements" and "not a masterpiece, but a good work".
If we judge based on the five stars, there are only "works that have no defects" and "works that are of the highest quality in everything" in the same row. So, if there is such a tendency, it is just a flaw in the system that does not suggest the meaning of stars. However, since such a system is actually used now, I think it would be better to give three stars (bad review) without hesitation.
Therefore, those who claim that the statement of this hand should be refuted in the Steam review.

“Hakobune” “Summer fish and seaweed fried in the near sea and homemade tartar sauce” | Leisure & Culture | Shiga Newspaper News | Shiga Newspaper LiVE
Appetizer "Grilled fish and shrimp from the sea near the coast and homemade tartar sauce"
Hakobune, a specialty restaurant in Tokyo that uses vegetables in creative and luxurious ways.
So that you can enjoy a restaurant-style meal at home, " is what Mr. and Mrs. Yoshitaka Yamada (39 and 38), who opened their restaurant last August, had in mind.
One of the popular menu items of the obentou is "Grilled fish and shrimp with home-made tartar sauce near the sea" (1,000 yen).
The fish chooses the best at that time in the market.
“Fry is seasoned with ingredients that can be tasted, and is thinly coated with pancake batter only” (Mr. Yoshitaka). Ebi Fry’s crispy taste can be savored directly.
A bowl of rice was served, topped with four kinds of vegetables in season, and a soup made from Hinohikari rice grown in Saga Prefecture.
Vegetables are made at home and sold at direct-sales shops in the prefecture.
Vegetables vary depending on the season, but Mr. Yoshitaka has studied French cuisine, and dishes such as rape and ratatouille add color.
On the other hand, there is a "taste that makes you want to eat it again and again" (Yamamoto), and a wide generation is happy with the Japanese-Western harmony.
Another popular dish is the "Hamburg steak made with minced beef from Japan" (1,000 yen).

Overall, it is not bad, but there is still room for improvement.
It is regrettable that it is easier to use when there are fewer people or when it is sent to the end.
Specifically, it is thought that it would be good to make a dedicated lane or ask people not to walk on it.
However, there were not many people on the train, and I thought it would be a good idea to take a ride while enjoying the scenery.
Whether it will be mainstream in the future or not, I felt a sense of uncertainty about the future from the vibration and the discomfort of the surrounding view. It was not an easy ride because I was not used to it.
I was so embarrassed.

The long journey of a family that has dedicated itself to environmental protection in China's border areas (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
（Kato Yoshitaka: Consultant, Asia Business Consulting, Hong Kong Branch） China, with its vast territory, is also important in terms of biological diversity. The number of species of mammals that give birth to live young is first in the world, and the number of plant species is third in the world.
The autonomous body recognizes the value of biological diversity, and not only does the autonomous body carry out environmental protection, but it also promotes the activities of environmental activists.
Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in southwest China's Yunnan Province is also one such area.
Li Wenjing, the younger sister, is now active as an actress. Xishuangbanna is a border area between Laos and Myanmar, and is the home of the "Dai (Tai) ethnic group" who share the same language and culture with the Thai people in Thailand. Many ethnic minorities live in this area.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through various countries in Southeast Asia, is flowing.
Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in southwest China's Yunnan Province Xishuangbanna, which covers slightly more than 0.2 percent of China's total area, is home to about 25 percent of wild animal species and 20 percent of plant species.
This time, I met Mr. Li Menghua, who has been carrying out environmental protection activities in Xishuangbanna, and had a talk with him about the content of the activity.
■ A German couple starts environmental protection activities together - They have been engaged in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What was the impetus for that?
Li started his environmental protection activity "Tian Qi" in 2000.
That was my husband Josef Margraf.
Her husband, who was born in Germany, came to Sri Lanka to work on a joint scientific project between the UN and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest in China and boasts a number of biological diversity.
On the other hand, however, economic development has lagged behind.
Therefore, in order to lay the foundation for industry in this area and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China, large-scale deforestation in the tropical rainforest has progressed.
Her husband was dispatched to Germany for the recovery of natural resources and the research of biological resources.
And I got married to the reporter I've been dating.
― It seems that Mr. Li did not have any interest in natural conservation before.
Mr. Li I was born in Sichuan, but I have never been interested in the significance and biodiversity of tropical rainforests.
Therefore, I have been promoting the project with my husband.
Even if the face is neat and the back is particularly high, it is amazing to see a person with an oral.

【Omotesando/Personal belongings】The reason why MOD became the cause of CTD in its self-contained environment took about a month and a half to determine
The CTD, which occurred due to a number of reasons during a period when stable data was available until March, was very consistent in terms of time when it was slightly examined during the holidays at the center.
What was the reason for not being able to log analyze with .Net Script Framework (it would be understandable after a few minutes)? Part of the error in the .dll series and the mesh is not left in the crash log.
Timing of main CTD
There is no trace left in the log of all the papyrus and .Net Script Framework, as well as the log of the type of .dll plug-ins that do not leave a trace.
* When an NPC kills/attacks accumulatively: The console kills → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in / powerofthree's SE update restart version) OFF to improve ※ Is there a possibility of getting wet?
When the camera work of killing an NPC is triggered, the basic improvement from OFF to OFF by the PC is made via the .ini: Is there a setting competition between DAR and Nemesis relationships? However, the upper limit of the number of DAR animation is 10,000.
During field movement + some magic (e.g. ice rune) activation, NPC hit: Dirt & Blood v 2.0's SPID use NPC setting (MCM's upper right) is all OFF for 5 consecutive tries to improve.
Was it due to the shader settings of additional protectors and body meshes for actors/NPCs? Note that the default.ini of SPID 2.0 has a syntax error, but the result is intentional. NPCs should have perks applied.
At first, we focused on checking the motion/battle MOD (those with .dll file extension) that attacked the position and OnHit relationship, but the result was such.
At least in English and German and French, there were no similar bug reports.
If there are many people who have the same CTD problem in the Japanese language environment, it may also be useful as a reference.
Cutting and everyone is doing their best.
It didn't seem to bother him at all, and his colleagues were the same.

Thoughts on the importance of psychiatric visiting nursing - Today's visiting nursing has ended
As I have a dual disability, I have been receiving long-term nursing care. However, I have a good relationship with the nurses at the nursing care station where I am currently using.
I talk about various things every week.
Of course, we can do what is necessary for drug management (such as one-pack preparation), but more than anything, it is important to think about how much joyful communication is important for people with mental disorders today.
Today, there was a lively discussion about gender differences between men and women or gender theory.
There were also conversations about men's and women's sexual desires, the reasons why she got divorced, and whether it was okay to talk about such things at a gynecological examination.
However, I also dressed up as a woman.
However, in the case of the visiting nursing station at the psychiatric hospital, it is said that there is no corresponding response to the business from the oba-chan nurses who are not working at the ward. And, it is said that there are cases that the nurses instruct from the top in a perfunctory manner such as "he is a doctor because he is working as a visiting nurse" when the operating nurses come.
What I use is a small outpatient clinic run by a social welfare corporation. I think that I am equal with patients who have mental disorders and that I can do my best as a caregiver.
You are really beautiful.
Those who are receiving a visit from a psychiatrist and those who are considering receiving one are welcome.
Visiting nursing is very helpful for people with mental disorders.
Please follow the doctor's instructions.
And let's choose a good hospital to visit.
In the past, no matter how much I struggled, there was always a way out.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patent, China's 50% of 1 ... "Slow implementation of hydrogen circulation load map" (Central Daily News Japanese version) - Yahoo! News
The South Korean government published a hydrogen circulation map in 2019.
The content was that by 2022, there would be 65,000 fuel cell vehicles (accumulated) and 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target water price was set at 6,000 yen per kiloliter (about 577 yen).
However, in November this year, the target of 27% (around 17,000 units) of fuel cell vehicles based on the reference was exceeded.
The timetable for the popularization of hydrogen stations for core infrastructure is also 38% (about 117 stations), and the hydrogen price per kilogram is 8,400 yen, which is the same as the load map at the time of publication.
It was found that the government's implementation of the hydrogen circulation map fell short of the target.
全経連 on the 12th published the report "Current Situation and Policy Direction of Hydrogen Economy and Life Cycle."
According to the report, the core parts and materials of hydrogen production mostly depend on the United States and Japan.
The carbon fibers, which are the core material of fuel cell vehicles, are supplied by Toray (Japan), the platinum catalyst is supplied by Kyocera (Japan), the membrane is supplied by DuPont (U.S.), Gore (U.S.) and 3M (U.S.).
The number of hydrogen technology patents held by the six countries that lead the world's hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% (since 2014).
In terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (2014-2020), South Korea ranks fifth in the world.
However, the entire industry conveyed that "in fact, six countries account for more than 70% of the world's hydrogen market, and actually, among competing countries, it is at the bottom."
In terms of national patent rankings, China, the United States, the EU and Japan come first, second, third and fourth, respectively.
Since 2017, China has surpassed the United States and widened the gap.
The number of patents registered in 2020 was 1033 in South Korea, surpassing Japan (974) to take 4th place, but China (4721) was at a 22% level.
The All-Japan Federation of Employers' Associations proposed that "hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large-scale investment and research and development tax exemption."

Is it a crime to sell goods at a higher price than the set price?
Today, PS5 was sold out at 70,000 yen at the store.
It is legal.
For example, when the price of the branded goods is higher than the fixed price
For example, when a painter becomes famous, the value of his or her work is expected to increase.
Ps５ is selling at a low value even though it is selling at a high value.

Making TV programs in the style of TV programs Making TV programs in the style of TV programs: Talking points for councilors in the midst of council reform: Hokkaido Shimbun Digital Edition
The town council of Tachikawa is making a strange chirashi to guide the convening of regular meetings, and introducing a "communication notebook" for citizens to evaluate councilors. The town is taking on a unique council reform.
The town council election is a three-term consecutive non-voting election. It is aimed at making the townspeople concerned.
In order to publicize the Sunday meeting held on the 12th, 1,800 copies of the new Chirashi were distributed to the press on the 9th.
From morning to evening "Giron" "Philosopher's Room" "Zawahiri Investigation Series"...
The town council's chirashi, which was handed out to all households on the 9th, has a wordplay that references popular TV programs.
Masahiko Komura, a 43-year-old member of the House of Representatives who took part in the creation of the new party, said, "I want to laugh and run for the House of Representatives."

U.S. military aid, including ammunition, arrives in Ukraine (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
（CNN） U.S. Department of State officials reported that weapons including small arms and ammunition arrived in Ukraine based on the plan for assistance in safety and security, which was approved by President Poroshenko.
Military assistance is considerable, at $60 million (around 6.8 billion yen), and the final equipment to be delivered to Ukraine this year includes four radars to track the launch sites of missiles such as the Iskander.
According to the Carrie report of the U.S. Department of Defense, these aids included weapons that kill people such as the anti-tank missile "Javelin".
The military support was aimed at strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities, including the reinforcement of troops by Russia in the perimeter of Ukraine.
The United States has stepped up its vigilance against the movement of the Russian military and is consulting with other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It is also working on a response plan in case Russia invades Ukraine.
When Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House on September 1 this year, Poroshenko was in power.
Military assistance to Ukraine from the United States has reached about $45 million this year.
Since Russia's annexation of Crimea, the total amount of assistance to Ukraine has risen above $250 million.
The U.S. military is also fulfilling the training mission of the Ukrainian army.
In the previous month, the state troops of Florida in the US were dispatched to Ukraine to take part in a joint military exercise with troops from other countries that supported Ukraine.
According to the statement of the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Special Operations Command in Europe plays a significant role in the training and assistance of the Ukrainian special forces.
The number of U.S. special forces operating in Ukraine is classified as a secret of the operation.
On the 7th of this month, the President of Belarus had an online meeting with the President of Russia, but the situation in Ukraine had deteriorated.
The United States is also preparing to impose strict economic sanctions when the invasion occurs.

The sequel and gift tax "correction" of prohibiting pre-birth donations, a direct hit on Gan Liangming, former chairman of the Taxation Committee of the Liberal Party!
The first special issue of "Weekly Diamond" on December 18 is "Talk with family at the end and the beginning of the year!"
It is called "fetal surgery and fetal intervention".
In the midst of the discussion on the integration of the succession tax and gift tax, the outline of the tax reform in 2022, which had been a matter of concern, was approved, but in the near future, the possibility of prohibiting lifetime gifts, which is the king of the succession tax measures, is high.
What changes will be made to the rules of succession?
Together with the direct hit to the former chairman of the Tax Commission of the Liberal Democratic Party and the member of the House of Councillors, Akira Amari, we will impart the technique from the basic principle of reducing tax burdens to the end of the fiscal year.
（Diamond Editing Department, Miyawara Kazuya）
from the owners of the assets to the employees of the companies in the urban areas to use the pre-natal donations as "restricted donations" "From the perspective of taxing more integrally the inheritance tax and gift tax, and aiming at the construction of a neutral tax system for the selection of the timing of asset transfers, we will push forward a thorough study."
In one of the documents of the 2021 tax reform plan announced by the party last year, the fluctuation has spread to the middle class in addition to the wealthy.
This is because that what was said was to change the rule of reciprocity and prohibit the "give and take" before birth in order to drastically increase the surcharge.
The ironclad measure of tax breaks for high-tier progressive taxes is to "reduce the assets subject to taxation."
Its strongest selling point is that it benefits not only those who own homes in the three major metropolitan areas, but also those who pay a small amount of succession tax despite not owning homes in the three major metropolitan areas.
The discussion on the integration of the "sales tax and gift tax" that collapsed in the middle.
What has been approved in the 22nd tax reform of December 10, 2019, which has been the subject of the fastest introduction, is as follows: "To review the current system of intergenerational gift tax and the system of gift tax exemption." "The gift tax exemption measures are a system that does not seek any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family to the extent of the ceiling." etc. The direction to integrate them has been clearly stated.
In this edition, the former chairman of the Tax Commission of the Liberal Democratic Party, Akira Amari, spoke.
It is a bit important to keep the same level of tax burden no matter when the assets are transferred.
Underneath, (through integration) what kind of problem is coming out, and where the simulation is being carried out," the fastest correction will be left with only three chances.
Even if so, in the near future, it would be a mistake to move in the direction of invalidating the pre-birth allowance as a fiscal stimulus.
What are the rules for succession tax and gift tax?

My True Brother will be broadcast on the ground wave from January 10, 2022. Yoshitaka Yamada "I'm looking forward to it!"
The FOD original drama "My True Brother" starring Gocchan will be broadcast on Fuji TV on January 10, 2022 at midnight.
【Photograph】Yoshitaka Yamada as Hiroin, the protagonist of the manga serialized in "BE LOVE" by Shogakukan Inc. since 2018, which is the original work of the same title as the manga by Morie Satoshi, which was serialized in "BE LOVE". It is a pure love story of a man and a woman who carry the past.
The main character's name is Hari, and the name of the heroine is Shizuku.
The university student met his predecessor, Ali, who was working at a part-time job.
Hayato, who has been suffering from insomnia, is a mysterious young man who is able to fall asleep on someone else's shoulder.
Risai, who looked like a brother living apart from his parents after their divorce, was attracted to Hiroshi, who looked like a brother, but was Hiroshi a killer?

【NFL】The team that won 3 passes in 1 tryout (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this match, John's pass = Peyton's pass was just 3 times.
This is the fewest number of passes thrown in a game by the Bills in the past 50 years in the NFL since 1974 when they had two against the New York Jets in Week 3.
In 1974, O.J. Simpson, a phenomenal running back who exceeded 2,000 yards in a season for the first time in history in the previous season, played for the Bills.
Bills sacked Simpson and fellow RB Jim Braxton for a loss.
The biggest reason for Patterson to make such an extreme offer was the weather.
Buffalo is located in a town near the Canada-US border and is almost the same latitude as Hokkaido's Sapporo.
And on this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius degrees before and after Mogi, and the wind speed was 18m/s; it was snowing before the game.
Billz was local only and did not change the playlist much.
Ran was 25 against 30 passes.
Aren's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception, and it was impossible not to score.
There were four break-ins in the 10-game offensive series, and there were opportunities to score.
In particular, the third quarter ended with three consecutive red zones.
However, they could not get more than 3 points in three games.
The goal before the final whistle of the match.
The Bulls, who were trailing by 4 points, committed a turnover at 3rd & 9 to become 3rd & 14.
It was 18 yards to the goal.
At 3rd & 14, QB Aaron was surrounded by the Pittsburgh defense and came out to the right from the pocket.
And he threw away his pass in the end zone by targeting TE Donnel Pumphrey.
In this play, Ace WR Stephen Diggs, who was free in the end zone to the right of the goalpost, was not seen by Aren.
On 4th and 18, Aren went after WR Gabriel Davis, who was left wide open from the left end zone, but the pass was batted down by DB Myles Bryant of the Bears at the line of scrimmage.
Brilliant had been covering Billings' WR call-up Beamer, but when he saw Allen's movement, he released Beamer and reacted to the pass.
Aren, who caught two receivers, threw two passes to the end zone.
The fourth down pass was probably decided, but the third down was not necessary to aim for a TD.
It is possible to win the first down with two plays.
Since it was only the 2nd inning, I thought that if I could make it to the 4th inning, Arano would be able to show his capabilities as a reliever.

Sponge
Even if it is replaced as frequently as possible, it is a sponge as long as it is not replaced as frequently as it is recommended.
According to a study in 2017, even if the kitchen sponge is sterilized every day with an electronic range, it is known that bacteria are breeding a lot (it is still recommended to sterilize with a range).
The German researchers who carried out this study are advising people to change their sponges once a week to keep them clean.
Mana board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has pointed out that if the scratches and grooves start, it should be replaced with a new board.
At first, it was difficult to keep the wound and the groove clean because bacteria were breeding.

FlashBIOS does not end
I bought the Ryzen7 5800X in September and replaced the B550 and Tomahawk with it.
I went as far as the BIOS setup screen, but when I saved the settings and restarted, a black screen with a white cursor flickering intermittently appeared.
It is not possible to rewrite using FlashBIOS even if you think that BIOS is damaged.
According to MSI's blog, it seems to end at 5 minutes, but it does not end even after 1 hour.

It has nothing to do with Gaijin.
It's better to say it early, "Why do you call me only/What's wrong with you?"
Is it because I'm an outsider that I don't have to care about it? It's better to say that it's simply unpleasant.
I don't think I've ever thought of a dream that makes me feel uncomfortable.
I've been living overseas, but the Japanese who went out were all included in the narrow-mindedness of Confucianism. I didn't know what to say to the local people.
If you see an Omi person, you would think that they have a sweet nature without any malice.
Even among my friends, there are a lot of people whose last names are written in katakana. I wondered what to call them when speaking in Japanese.
If you have friends, it's not so bad.
At first, I thought I would do it purely, but it's not because it's an exceptional case that has to be dealt with.
I can't speak Japanese because I'm not Japanese.
Henshū: I don't care, but my white friend who came back from overseas always raises his glass higher than others at a party.
It is a good habit to be aware of the mistake and try not to do it again. It is a good habit to think that it is a Japanese-like thing to make an excuse for a mistake because I can be forgiven.
Japanese people, regardless of their personality, think that it is troublesome to live with such a person (including me).

It is difficult for those who do not speak Japanese to understand the subtle nuances of the Japanese language.
I don't know what level you are seeking, but if you are seeking a level that does not make Japanese people feel uncomfortable, it is thought that it is good to explore other possibilities.

It is a battle to practice the teachings of "On the Elimination of Demons."
“Compensation for Efforts” is Equivalent to a Human Singing a Song [Starting Commemoration of the Anime “Yokohama Shopping Trip”] (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
Among recent shonen manga, "Demon Slayer" is unique in that it is "full of training".
The fact that there is no battle in the latter half of the story, and that even when it is bright, the characters are working hard, has become a fixed point that the readers like.
It has been two years since Luffy was separated from his crew in the same jump comic, ONE PIECE. However, it can be said that it is a push from the fact that he was soaring in the air with just a touch.
After all, the exoticism of walking on the land is one of the charms of Wanpi. "Staying and practicing at the same place" is also something that is not compatible with the character.
The main character of "Sword of Demon Slaying", Zhang Jiulang, offered a prayer for the life of the brave Mount Hua warrior, who had sacrificed his life to help others, saying, "It is outrageous to take away the rights of life and death from others!"
The weak have no rights and no choice but to be defeated by the strong ... ... .
At the same time, the introduction of "Ikushi" Rinzawa, who whipped the hopefuls of the Demon Slaying Corps, was a virtue of bravery (an underhand way of explaining the intention).
The first contact between Shouji Lang and Reiko was when Shouji asked, "What should I do when my sister eats people?" and Shouji, who was at a loss for an answer, immediately retorted, "Judgment is slow."
Even among the fans, there was a lot of talk that couldn't be ignored.
However, the possibility of being forced to make such a judgment cannot be denied.
It is an initiative to start from the heart.

The mountain is honeycombed with caves and tunnels dug by dynamite and traps set by machine guns, so that climbing it is like a one-way trip to the grave.
Even so, the strong sense of smell of Wana, who was taken care of by people with a sharp sense of smell, made me sneeze. It seems that the "correction of the main character" has become a way to avoid it.
Nevertheless, "I was so surprised that I could all of a sudden dodge it! I was so surprised that my physical ability became so high!" was what Takeshi said to Kazuhiro, but it might be the essence to get rid of the demon by getting rid of the demon.
Ordinary people would not become suddenly strong or be able to use the power and skills they have cultivated until then.
The "equivalent exchange of effort" that does not report anything about the effort that has been made, and only reports the result of success or failure, is a human praise that is different from the demon that holds an unreasonable power, and it is a difficult rule that is consistent in this work.

In such a case, there is no need for me to say "I'm sorry."
In other words, I think it is a "game" to try to gain more benefits with less efforts.

South Korea's Samsung Electronics has set up a new "DX department" that integrates home appliances and mobile phones, emphasizing the "user experience" (WoW! Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following the integration of its CE and IM departments as a set department, Sony Electronics decided to name the department DX (Device eXperience) and reflect this in the organizational changes at the end of the year, as announced on the 12th.
Through various services from mobile to home appliances, the intention to enhance the user experience (Experience) can be read.
Samsung Electronics disclosed that the DX department, which made its debut by integrating the CE and IM departments, consists of VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and network businesses.
A spokesman for Samsung Electronics said that "the name change this time reflects the mid- to long-term business structure and future vision as well as the global leadership strengthened."
Moreover, products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment, of course, reflect the needs of customers through services and solutions that have optimized the consumer experience.
A strategy to build a foundation of differentiated products and services based on the synergistic effect of large-scale cooperation beyond the boundaries of the organization was also named.
Already, Samsung Electronics has been working on a strategy to allow users to freely use content and services across devices such as home appliances and smartphones that are based on mono Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) through the "Multi-Device Experience (MDE) Forum".
Is 1500 BCE before the era?
How do you say it in Japanese?
It was 1500 years ago.
BC is an abbreviation for "Before Christ" (before the birth of Christ), but why show consideration to people other than Christians? Based on this way of thinking, in recent years, the practice of expressing BCE has increased.
BCE stands for Before Common Era (BC).

24 accidents in Aichi Prefecture The truck driver was not ill (Television Asahi (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
It was found that the driver of the trailer, who was arrested and sent to the prosecutor's office after causing a traffic accident in which 24 cars collided in Showa-machi, Aichi Prefecture, did not have any illness and the accident was apparently caused by some kind of inadvertence.
At around noon on the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Route 41 in the city of Shouguang, and 12 people were slightly injured.
Police suspected that Yoshitaka Yamada, a 71-year-old man, was the victim of a hit-and-run traffic accident and arrested Nobuhiro Yamada (54), the driver of the trailer who was suspected of the crime, on the morning of the 12th and sent him to the prosecutor's office.
The trailer of the suspect Nonomura continued to move forward even after the accident, and the fire department also confirmed that the suspect Nonomura was temporarily unconscious after the accident.
However, according to the investigators, there was no sign of illness in the suspect Yoshitaka Yamada, and it was believed that some carelessness was the cause.
Police searched the man's home and are currently investigating the details of the incident.

Ogino MX's Beef Curry Review [Comic Vol. 4] (Weekly NEWS) - Yahoo! News
The 20th edition of the Superhuman Olympics, which began in volume 3, concludes in this volume!
The first volume, from the opening to the decisive battle before the end, contrasts with the new arrangement, which focuses on only one battle!
● Meat Man Volume 4 Review Submitter's Name oginumaX★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) ● Superhuman Pro Wrestling starts even before the match begins!
This fourth volume is a page-turner that meticulously depicts the decisive match between Kinmeat Man and Robin Mask, but first of all, it is not a volume that only depicts the match on the ring that has been determined.
Ever since the autograph session started, we have been competing with each other in a good-natured way, such as taking photos together or wearing each other's uniforms, but we have never failed to try our best in any match until now.
The sense of tension slowly building up in the work, which began with the start of the century's first battle, is in harmony with the increasing tension of the readers. It is a real performance, which is calculated in this period.
And then, just before the decisive battle, there was a third place playoff between Teryiman and Ramenman.
Despite its luxury as a title challenger, what I like is that the ramen man at the backstage directed a "Hey, I'll win from now on!" poster to the Kinmeat man before the match.
And try to choke him.
However, the determined Terman, who did not give up, stopped him from drawing his sword, glared at him in silence, and created a scene where they separated without saying a word.
This is so great, both of them have already been defeated, and there is no chance to fight with Kinshiro at this conference anymore.
But there is such a thing as being too picky about your meat.
When I saw this, I couldn't help but look forward to a bright future!
It's just such a thing that when Cara stands up, I, as a manga artist, am so impressed!
Such a fight between the two was destined to end without a clear winner, but the highlight of the bout was the tears of the ramen man after the match.
To the meat man, "Only the strength of God's work is not enough!"
That is a serif.
Isn't this a grandiloquence metaphor against the work itself? Up to now, readers might feel that the main character cannot lose because he is the protagonist, and might feel that he won for no reason.
However, by making this remark to the ramen man, Mr. Yamada pricked himself with his own words.
With this one sentence, readers will think, "Isn't it true that the meat man will knock down Robin with his real strength?"
What happened?
So, I imagined the development of the previous work, and when viewed from the perspective of another creator, it may be that the work was produced by Mr. Tamago, who tied his own hands and feet.
This is amazing.
I think one of the big points of this volume is that there are no mistakes.

Winter Illumination will be held at Mt. Koyama, Gotemba, Shizuoka Prefecture (Fuji Television) - Yahoo! News
The winter illumination, which is held for the first time at Mt. Shinsan in Gobu, is beginning, and the garden is wrapped in beautiful light.
（December 12） The illumination of winter, which began on November 26, started with 50,000 LED lights that are scattered around the 20-meter-tall cryptomeria, in harmony with the zigzag path and shishigashira.
Visitors from Shiga Prefecture said, "It's been a long time since I came to Fukui, and it's been a long time since I've been here.
It was so beautiful and I was so happy."
The illumination is turned on from 5:05 pm to 8:30 pm on December 25th, from 5 pm to 8:30 pm on Saturdays, and from 5 pm to 8 pm on Sundays, while avoiding crowds.
Furthermore, on the 25th, the final day, there are plans to hold a Christmas event and show the film.

This morning, Fukushima was…
The power supply of the NAS PC has failed 🎉🎉🎊🎉
What happened?
1.) Open the window to air the room.
During the power-on of the PC.
2.) When I returned to the room after a little while, there was a pink rotator sound from the PC.
At this point, it was considered that the movement of the fan was worsening due to the low temperature (6℃).
So, I tried warming up the room again.
3.) Not started.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp lights up for a moment, but immediately stops.
After that, I didn't say anything.
I tried plugging it in again, but it didn't work at all.
4.) The motherboard and the ATX20 pin and the 4-pin were disconnected, and the rest of the parts were removed and tried, but it did not start.
5.) There was a sound of "bubububu" that made PSU fans suspicious that PSU was not the cause.
I tried to find the ATX power supply later.
Well.

In 2021, the well-used emoji ranking (Gizmodo Japan) - Yahoo! News
My most frequently used character is the crying emoji.
I think that pictures are an indispensable communication tool for modern people.
Recently, with the help of messaging apps and chat tools, it has become more common to react with pictures instead of stickers.
Speed, simplicity, no need for a reply, and the element of surprise.
In modern communication, emoji is a must in the soft and warm atmosphere!
By doing so, everyone can use emoji.
Looking at the whole picture, the ranking of the most frequently used characters in 2021 The most frequently used characters in the world in 2021!
The overall positive and bright picture is ranked.
According to Unicode, 92% of the world's Internet population uses pictures.
1st place has a 5% usage rate of all characters!
The first, third, and fifth characters in the crying and laughing series are very convenient to use.
When I'm nervous, I'm happy, of course!
At that time, there was no other choice... Even when you are feeling down, there are not many people who can use violence.
People who have never used any of the top 10 emojis are the real deal.
That style is what I want to do.
