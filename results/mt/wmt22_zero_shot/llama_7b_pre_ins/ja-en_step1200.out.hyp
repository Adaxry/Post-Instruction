I don't even want to watch TV anymore...
Is it impossible for a celebrity to become bankrupt? They are celebrities because of TV.
Yesterday at Netflix, I watched "Terrace House," but there were so many scenes where the staff snickered behind me when I said something boring.
It's obvious that there's nothing funny about "I'm a comedian so I can say anything."
But if the staff don't smile, the mood of the artist will be spoiled, and the work will become tasteless.
In the past, sports meetings for black businessmen were held everywhere, but the ego of some artists was too much and it was embarrassing to be ordinary.
On the other hand, there are a lot of people who say, "It's so embarrassing to be a creator."
It is understandable that there are few earnings since it is not easy to become popular. However, it is ridiculous to say that being an artist is an easy job.
The beautification of one's own career and the entertainers who smile and joke in the media and society can only be heard.
It is true that the industry where you work can be a small world, but the entertainment industry is full of people who seem to know each other.
Please don't say such foolish things.
I felt like my body wouldn't be healthy if I didn't go out.

Merchandise ordered at Tsukumo Net Shop was substituted at random
In short, if you order a wireless mouse, the wired version of the mouse will come, and if you want to return it, it will be said that it will be returned.
Rather than talk about my self-made PC, which has become a hot topic, I would like to write about somewhere famous.
The discovery was made when MSI's wireless gaming mouse, which started from the previous golden week, was put on sale for 3,280 yen (link to fishing rod).
Since the price of the wireless version was the same as that of the wired version at the store, we also confirmed the page of the wireless version considering the possibility of the price mistake.
The order mail arrived normally, and the shipment mail arrived the next day.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 Lightweight Wireless" was written in the purchase records of the two emails and my page.
Since there was no cancellation notice from the order to the shipment, it was thought that the ordered wireless mouse would arrive at this time.
This is a problem here. An email saying "There was an error in the registration of goods" arrived a few hours after delivery.
According to the email,
The radio version was sold at a special price, but it was actually the wired version.
Since the wireless mouse has already gone on sale,
1. Refusal of acceptance and total cancellation
2. Return only the mouse
3. Use the wireless mouse as it is
Choose the corresponding
The merchandise page of the wireless version can be distinguished from that of the wired version, and the purchase record, email, and invoice are written in the wireless version, so it would be nice if you could send me the wireless version by chance.
You don't know what you've bought and what you haven't? You'll just have to send it back then.
Please lend me your wisdom if you have any idea about how to return the money.

The only bridge connecting the region to the outside was washed away by the typhoon and heavy rain. The residents were prepared with three times of food supplies in Yabuki-machi, Fukushima (Yahoo! News)
Mr. Matsubon Shoran, from Yamaki Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
The great impact on the lifestyle of three generations of eight people was caused by the 2019 East Japan earthquake.
Matsumoto Hiroyasu: "At first, I felt like 'Magical'.
I felt that it would collapse at any moment, or that it would be washed away. The only way through the highlands, the Highland Bridge, was swept away in the tsunami, leaving 30 elderly residents of the region stranded.
Residents who had their water cut off had to rely on the JR bridge, which usually doesn't allow pedestrians.
Mr. Matsumoto Hiroyasu said, "Generally speaking, it is convenient to come to the court by car. However, since we have to carry our bikes when the car comes, or carry them on our backs over the bridge, I felt the inconvenience of transportation and the bike." The emergency bridge completed one month later was put into a state of loneliness due to heavy rainfall for several days, which lasted for more than three months.
Although it has been two years since the disaster, Mr. Matsumoto has continued the countermeasures that he taught.
Masahiko Sato: "I think there are about 10 cases.
At first, I thought it would be a good idea to secure enough food for two to three days." Foods that can be used for bento and cup noodles were fortified to about three times the amount before the disaster.
Ms Matsubara: "I don't know when a disaster will strike my body. So I think it's better to be prepared even a little bit." Yajima, who experienced the "disaster beyond imagination", said.
In order not to forget the lessons, the town began to make its own arrangements in 2021.
Takahashi Ryuichi, the head of the class at Yaji-chō Elementary School: "We would like to think about what to prepare for next year's disaster prevention day, October 12, in the shape of 'Disaster Prevention Day in Yaji-chō.'"
So far, the awareness that unexpected events can happen has been heightened.

Participants said ... "The scenery has changed so much and it was so enjoyable."
It's amazing to walk through the streets of Tokyo like this, and I'm so glad we can do it while having fun. I think it's great that we were able to push through to the end while competing against each other. The organizers of Tokyo wanted to create a venue that people can enjoy even after the Games.

Be careful when buying a used house!
The "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
● Activation of the secondary housing market The newly established "Building Condition Survey" system for second-hand houses is popular.
The price of detached houses also increased, and the market for renovation is also expanding.
On the other hand, the popularity of words such as "station front, station near, and station direct connection" and "large-scale" and "tower" is increasing, and this is also affecting the popularity of new buildings.
However, compared to overseas, the circulation of existing (used) houses in Japan is still low.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) amended the Building Transaction Law to start a survey on the status of buildings, called an inspection, with the purpose of trading in secure, second-hand houses (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/1219900.pdf).
This is a system in which builders who are specialized in houses check the current situation of the property including the deterioration of the building and report it.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that there are merits for both buyers and sellers with the introduction of inspection.
The seller can avoid liability for latent defects by having the property inspected before putting it on the market, which provides buyers with peace of mind.
It is due to the differentiation of competitive objects.
On the other hand, for the buyers, it is an advantageous system in which the state of the used house which they are going to purchase can be known, and they can be able to purchase it.
However, on the current system, it is mainly the sellers who have the authority to lead the building condition survey.
In addition, it is also necessary to pay attention to the point that the notification of the inspection system has become mandatory.
In other words, real estate agents who are in charge of introducing the property will say, "You can introduce architects who will survey the building conditions when introducing the property," or "You cannot introduce them." However, there is no obligation to implement it.
Inspection led by the wholesaler raises the risk In contrast, when you turn your eyes to overseas markets, there are already similar systems in place in active markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom.
In the preliminary stage of real estate transactions, the buyer relies on specialists called "inspectors" or "building surveyors".
For example, in the United States, 70 to 90 percent of inspections of second-hand homes are carried out.
In terms of being led by the "buyer" for the inspection, the main Japanese-style inspection of "seller" is different from its nature.
The seller side tends to show the condition of the building at least, keep it high and sell it early.
On the other hand, the buyer's side considers that it is safe to live after having a taste of the inspection and making suitable improvements.
Even in the same inspection, the purposes and thoughts of both sides are at odds.
For this reason, the following points are cited as risks for Japan's system.
● The inspection range of the seller-dominant type inspection defined by the state will be minimized.
As there is no detailed survey, there is a risk of overlooking really important inadequacies. ◎ For the inspection company, the intermediary company that introduces the case (the broker) can be the customer as well.
There is a possibility that the inspection, in which the seller did not report the unfavorable survey results, was conducted.

Was Ginza an island?
Five Talking Points in Economics (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
「Ah, this is Naha.
As a proof, ... ... It can be seen in Ginza.
I'd like to introduce you to some trivia about the Statue of Liberty that you might not know.
Up on the silver screen!
First dive into the pool
As you walk through Ginza, you can still see the silhouette of the history carved in the name that changes with the wind, the mysterious stone monument, and the many old shops.
They walked while talking about Ginza, and suddenly became silent. "Ah, this used to be the old capital, you know.
Did Ginza used to be an island?
The nickname for bustling shopping streets that have sprung up everywhere in Japan, such as "Ginza" in Tokyo's Chuo Ward.
In fact, "Ginza" is the name of a mint where silver coins were minted. In 1612 (Keicho 17th year), the Ginza Office where is currently placed in Shizuoka Prefecture was transferred to Edo.
At that time, it was called "Shinryokucho", but it was called "Ginza" when it was transferred to Waseda.
In fact, a "peninsula" protruding into the sea could be seen in the Ginza area.
From the Edo period onwards, the Sumida River flowed into the inner circle of the moat, and a half-island called Edojima stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of that peninsula is now occupied by the Financial District.
Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the bakufu in Edo and buried the entrance to the Edo River to develop the repair of the Kyobashi area.
Furthermore, in order to improve the living environment of the city and promote the development of shipping, the government has invested in the improvement of the urban environment and the development of shipping.
And the ruins of the embankment and the Sumida River were buried.
By the way, there is a stone monument indicating the traces of the former Ginza Office on the ground in front of the Tiffany & Co. Ginza Branch (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku). So, if you are interested in the traces of the former Ginza Office, you may want to check it out.
Knowing people will know the "pilgrimage" of the sacred site in Ginza
Every year, a "sacred pilgrimage" around the Eight Shrines of Ginza is held.
Among the 10 or more sacred places, the "Izumo Taisha Grand Shrine" in front of the "Izumo Taisha" is the most noticeable.
There are fewer and fewer people who come and watch the performance after work.
On the other hand, "Longevity and Virtue" is on the ceiling of Matsuya Ginza, and "Ginza Shiseidō" is on the 9th floor of Matsuya Ginza.
The "Tamaki Hachiman Shrine" and the "Azuka Hachiman Shrine" are in the precincts of the roadside shrine, but they are hidden, and the "Tamaki Hachiman Shrine" is known to have been respected by the dancer and choregrapher Yamashita Tomonosuke. The "Success Hachiman Shrine" in the entrance of the Mitsui Shopping Building 1F is not open to the public, except for when it is next to the Yushima Shrine.
There are some shrines where the spirits of the unmarried emperor and the earth deity are enshrined, but most shrines worship Inari as a god of fertility.
The "Inari Shrine" which the fox greeted in front of the shrine is built in a place where there are many farmers, and it is assumed that there is a benefit of "five grains and prosperity" in which the rice is well threshed.

South Korea's Posco International has acquired Senegal's Seneka Energy, expanding its overseas gas business - South Korea report (WoW!Korea - Yahoo! News)
Posco International announced on the 12th that it had concluded an investment contract with Senex Energy and Hancock Energy, which acquired shares of Senex Energy.
At present, there are still some procedures such as the recognition of the shareholders' meeting of Sany Group and the local corporation. The acquisition procedures are expected to be completed in March next year.
This year's acquisition is the world's largest M&A case after Posco was integrated into the Posco Group in 2010.
The purchase amount was 770.9 billion yen, and POSCO International accounted for 50.1%, and Hancock Energy accounted for 49.9%, respectively.
Posco International said that even in the era of energy transition, the demand for natural gas continues to increase, and blue natural gas, which is the foundation of the natural gas market, and green natural gas jointly account for two-thirds of the market in the hydrogen market.
This time Posco International purchased 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas storage equivalent to 44% of Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019. It will also secure the manpower for the onshore gas field in Texas.

Its pain, if it were only "arthritis of the ankle joint"!
Different treatment methods due to the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editorial Department: We have been suffering from leg pain recently.
What kind of illness is possible?
Mr. Maruyama: The pain of the knee joint is caused by various things such as reflex sympathetic dystrophy and wind puffiness.
Among them, the most common is "arthritis".
Editorial department: Is it because the joints have deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which cushions the impact and allows the joint to move smoothly.
However, due to aging and obesity, weightlifting and other intense sports can cause the ligaments to stretch and bend.
As a result, the deformation and inflammation of the joints occur.
The editorial department: Is knee arthritis contagious?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, other joints such as the interphalangeal joint of the fingers, the attachment root, the head, the waist, and the ankle can also cause pain.
But the most common is a case of "arthritis of the knee".
Editors: So, what kind of structure does the joint make?
Mr. Maruyama: The joints are formed by two bones coming together.
And the part that faces each other is covered with "synovial joint cartilage", while the surrounding of the joint is covered with "synovial membrane".
Editorial department: It's a complicated structure.
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
The inner layer of the capsule is called the synovial membrane, which makes synovial fluid.
This synovial fluid serves as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and condroitin disulfide.
That's why it's said that "to make the knee move smoothly, it's good to have hyaluronic acid and condroitin disulfide."
Editorial Department: What kind of symptoms do you get when you have a deforming joint disease?
Mr. Maruyama: The joint cartilage is elastic and serves the role that bones do not touch directly.
Well, it's like a cameo.
However, if it is twisted or distorted, it causes joint deformity or inflammation, resulting in pain.

The 3 best gambles and games from the "Kaiji" series that you can actually experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The explosively popular manga series "Kaiji" centered on a male character.
One of the flavors of this work is a game of life and death.
【Photos】Just by looking, your feet will go numb... Challenging the steel-framed bridge!
Therefore, this time I would like to verify the game of the kaji that is actually played or practiced in the promotional video.
The trap-filled Pachinko "Nu" appeared in "Gambling Breaks Jail".
In the original, it was priced at 4000 yen for one ball, and caused a sensation.
This "quagmire" had big traps such as "Iron Forest", "Maneuverable Unit" and "3-step Crew". The strategy was almost impossible.
Taking advantage of any opportunity, Kaji used any means to accomplish his mission, including digging a trench to pour cement for a water tank made of vinyl.
The "slime" that appears in the game actually appears as Pachinko, and many people play it.
Of course, it's not like the "4000 yen for a single gem", and the difficulty has been lowered, but it should be possible to get a feel for the kiai.
The "Star Side Party" where the bailiff with the gold contained a kimono was held was implemented in the "Human Horse Race".
The debtors scampered up the slender, 10-meter-high steel frame installed on the ground, vying for speed.
Up to 12 people can take part, but there are only four safety cables, and insufficient safety measures, so the possibility of death is quite high.
This bridge is dangerous, but it is possible to experience an extremely close one by installing the "Egul Bridge" which has been used for the VR game other than the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles' original home "Rakuten Life Park Miyagi".
The bridge, which is 20 meters (seven floors of a building) high, has a single-arched bridge of steel, and "Sky Bridge" and "Bridge of Victory" are prepared ahead.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Corea, a comedian, posted a video on her YouTube channel saying that she could experience the Eiffel Tower in Japan and it became a hot topic.
■ E Card 2-player card game, "E Card".
The emperor's card is 1, the citizen's card is 8, and the slave's card is 1, making a total of 10 cards to be played on both the emperor and slave sides.
This game is very well done, the emperor is strong with citizens, citizens are strong with slaves, and slaves are strong with the emperor.
Kaiji fights against the Ling River by the rule of "losing his hearing if he loses".
An apparatus that destroys the eardrum-like device that was attached to the end of the hard-fought war was able to read the psychology by transmitting the change of the carotid artery and body temperature. The kayak that was inspired by the device that destroys the eardrum-like device attached to the end of the hard-fought war by sensing the change of the carotid artery and the body temperature was able to win the victory.
The card is sold in Japan and can be purchased at places like Amazon.
A video in which YouTuber Hikaru, who is popular on YouTube, plays the role of Kazuto Ishii, who is defeated by Eikura Nana in the movie, has been uploaded on YouTube, attracting attention.
Did you feel the tension in the air?
Nobody wants to be in a situation like Kai's, but it's a fact that reading manga can make you feel better.
Through the game, you can feel the world view.
A Step Closer to the New Year and a Gracious Retreat of the Great Horse of the God of the Province | Yamagata News
At the beginning of the New Year, the preparations for the New Year are in full swing at the State Guest House (Matsue City, Shimane Prefecture).
On the 11th day of the month, the designers of the Tohoku Crafts and Arts University visited the shrine, and a worship service was held in front of the shrine.
The shrine has been relying on the craftsmanship of the Echizenya for the original drawing of the horse since last year.
This time, the work of 22-year-old Tsuchiya Yui, a participant in the art course taught by Professor Momoko Endo, was selected.
The huge horse is 3.3 meters tall and has a height of about 1.8 meters at its center.
Tsuchiya drew an image of "a cherry blossom gently pressing against your back as you step into a new year."
The figure of a man gazing at the cherry blossom is a wish for a world where people can appreciate the beauty of nature.
The design of Mr. Tsuchiya is generally depicted in the picture of a horse.
Kenji Gobara, a 44-year-old resident of Minamisoma, Fukushima Prefecture, said, "I think it will help people who are struggling."

Consider "Stay at Yamaguchi" Yamaguchi Prefecture aims to hold workshops for people in their 40s and 50s who want to start their own businesses.
What kind of town was Tomono in 2030?
Students from four colleges and universities in Yamaguchi City are taking part in a workshop to consider the slogan "Stay in Yamaguchi."
As a part of the survey and policy proposal business of the intermediate support organization "Tamaki Sdg Miraizuki Center," young people's voices were summarized and proposed to the mayors.
When is it fun?
In response to the question of the facilitator, the students answered by saying things like, "When many people are cheering," and "When I'm drumming."
It was held for the first time at the Nippon Club on November 13.
Eighteen students from colleges and people in the local community talked about the "island" decided by each theme while moving the "island" in the "World Cafe" method.
Their thoughts were written on paper and arranged in order.
A town with many young people is lively. "Traffic such as trains and buses is not necessary for a convenient life."
There is no common ground, so let's talk more.
Tamaki thought it would be boring to circle the coast, but it was fascinating to be able to circle the coast," said Tamaki, a third year student at the Tamaki Commercial High School (18 years old).
The 18-year-old third-year student of Bina Naga High School said, "There are few shops, and traffic is inconvenient, but it is nice to see that nature is rich here." By talking with the elderly, I found that the charm of the region goes beyond its problems.
The second one in December was just for university students to gather and organize the contents of the speech.
The mayor and the education minister are also scheduled to hold a news conference in February next year.
Tamaki, the president of the same center, said, "It is important to cultivate the hometown love of university students while they are young."
Magnitude 4 earthquake jolts eastern Japan; epicenter off Chiba Prefecture - Yahoo! News
At 0:31 p.m. on the 12th, there was a 4-magnitude earthquake in Saitama, Chiba, Tochigi and Gunma prefectures.
According to the Meteorological Agency, the epicenter was in the south of Saitama Prefecture, and the depth of the hypocenter was about 50 kilometers.
The magnitude of the earthquake is estimated to be M5.0.
I am not worried about the tsunami.

How to find it The new twist of the store (Nikkei Newspaper) - Yahoo! News
It's a must-visit store in winter, but there are times when you can't help but take off your coat.
It's good to straighten your posture while looking into a mirror, but it's hard to know if you're doing it correctly.
I thought I would find something new even if it was covered with dust and cobwebs.
The COTTO RI (COTTO RI) store has a long side of about 1 meter, and a compact size that is more compact than usual.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Is it really that short and curly?"
If you look closely, you will find that the cloth, which has been meticulously cut, is sewn together to make one piece with a net-like pattern.
The end of the web is open.
As a result, it is possible to join the ends without sewing.

The documentary about Bitlz, who came to Disneyland
Get Buck, directed by Peter Jackson
It's so fresh and new that I feel like a giant...
Because it happened just before the dispersal, the tension was high, but it was not as dramatic as it seemed in the image.
Even though I knew it, I couldn't help but say, "Ah, I see!" to Paul, who was diligent, "Ah, well..." to George, who had a cool demeanor, and "Ah, it's going to take some time..." to Jon, who was diligent. There was also the lime, which had a bitter taste because it was not peeled.
I didn't want to be bothered with all that kind of thing, but there was an atmosphere of "it's impossible to do anything else but work." There was a sense of that in the air, and the Bitters also had that sense. Was it dismantling a legend?
And only when everyone can breathe that kind of air, can we all truly shine.
A bit of a phrase from each other, "What's going on?", "That's a famous song."
In particular, the moment when Get Buck appears in the title is amazing.
Sarigenai FUNFUNFUUUUUUUUUUUUUN, a funny nose song, is recorded gradually.
It is amazing to see the process of composition in such a way.
After all, everyone is covered in grease, so we're happy just to watch the performance.
Still, one episode in and the biggest impression thus far is just how different the world around Bitcoin was.
But as soon as the four of them started making puns, I thought, 'This is going to be so much fun!' But where are we going to do the live? The promoters and people like that would say, 'The Beatles are number one in the world!' And I would say, 'Yeah, but look how far we've come!'
Ah, the documentary has an explanation from director Peter Jackson so we may never know...
After that, since Paul was repairing, there were many scenes where Paul was surrounded by villains.

Large-scale damage from tornadoes in America (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the evening of August 10 (Friday) to the morning of August 11 (Saturday) local time, there were numerous tornadoes in the southern part of the United States.
During this period, there was a strong cool effect due to the record warmth, and the state of the air became very unstable due to the rapid development of convective clouds.
Warm air flowed into the southern United States from the southwest, resulting in record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperature in the local time on Day 9 (Monday) and Day 10 (Tuesday) is expected to be around 30℃.
In such a record-breaking warmth, the strong coldness of -30℃ or lower near 5,500m in the sky caused active fronts with a large temperature difference to be formed rapidly, resulting in cumulonimbus clouds to develop rapidly along the fronts.
Tornadoes were observed in the vicinity.
The South is prone to tornadoes, but the first half of summer is usually quiet, and few cases of major damage occur during this period.
The alert issued in winter reached 150 times near and was recorded.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said there were 400 reports of tornadoes and strong winds only on the 10th (Friday) local time.
This suggests that there are two concentrated areas, one on the south side of the line extending from Kentucky to Texas, and one on the north side including Illinois.
In the EF scale (enhanced Fujita scale) showing the intensity of the tornado in Kansas, it reached the level of EF3, the third strongest on a scale of 6 steps, and temporary gusts of 70m/s were observed.
There is a possibility that it will be judged as EF4 or EF5 in the future.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version of the improved Tateyama Scale) is used, which is based on the improved Tateyama Scale.
The JEF3 earthquake that occurred in the United States this time has a high possibility of occurring in Japan as well, and wooden houses can be destroyed at this level.

Miyagi prefecture "the greatest in history" tsunami undersea live broadcast to seek help (Nikkei Sports) - Yahoo! News
With regard to the damage caused by Typhoon Hagibis in the middle and south of the United States, the commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral William Moran, on the 11th (Japanese time on the 12th) showed a mysterious face with "the largest typhoon in the history of the United States."
It was reported by media such as CNN TV.
Biden stressed that "the federal government will do everything."
The full extent of the damage inflicted, including the loss of life, is still not known.
The death toll exceeded 100.
Photos Damaged houses and belongings are carried by residents through the debris in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael in Panama City, Florida. At least 30 people were killed in six states, including Florida, from Sunday evening to Monday morning.
A record of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) of damage from the tornado is left in 1925 in states such as Missouri. However, the meteorologist of CNN in the United States said that this time the estimation of the maximum scale was about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
The massive damage at the Mayfield, Kentucky, plant, which was operating around the clock for the Christmas rush, underscores the severity of the blow.
There were 110 people on duty at the time, but the building was destroyed and the silhouette disappeared.
In the dark, a woman who had stopped moving because she was lying on a thickness of about 15 cm under the rubble was able to feel the weight of a rescue worker searching for her on top of the rubble through her smartphone.
In addition to the female voice calling for help, the song "Happy Birthday to You," which is sung while crying as a way to terrorize another woman, can also be heard in the live broadcast.
Anbar Brown, a convenience store clerk who lives in Mayfield Heights, was hiding in a basement with her 5-year-old son because of the tornado warning.
The sound of the train was loud, but the sound that came out of the ground was so scary like an earthquake.
Meanwhile, the police officer of Mayfield City Police said, "The search operation will continue until it is no longer necessary.
We don't know how many weeks, months or years it will take.
A warehouse storing goods for Internet retail giant Amazon collapsed in the state of Illinois, killing at least six people.
Train derailment due to a strong impact from the separation of the train, and the closure due to the influence of highways such as vehicle overturning are occurring simultaneously.
According to the U.S. web media, about 400,000 rooms including 130,000 rooms in Tennessee are reported to be affected.

Opinions differ on the evaluation system of the star system.
Other countries, on the other hand, have been reducing their emissions based on the five major greenhouse gases. Japan, on the other hand, has been adding/reducing its emissions based on three major greenhouse gases.
There is a difference of two stars in terms of the reference point, and four stars are "having a decreasing element" and "a good work though not a masterpiece".
When the five stars are used as the criteria, works of art that are "deficient in nothing" and "at the highest level in everything" will line up. Therefore, there is a tendency to think that the system is defective if there is such a tendency. However, since such a system already exists, it is better not to give the three stars (bad evaluation).
That's why people who advocate this move will find it hard to counter Steam's two-strike review system.

Donation "Fresh sashimi and sushi from the Seto Inland Sea in the morning"
A colorful and generous bento using vegetables and a specialty shop "Hakobune" that uses vegetables.
The couple, who opened the restaurant in August last year, wanted it to have a relaxed atmosphere.
One of the popular menu items is "Sashimi and sushi of tuna caught early in the morning" (1,000 yen).
The fish chooses its good times in the market.
Flaky pastries are made with as little dough as possible so that the taste of the ingredients shines through, says Ms. Kikuchi. Ebi-flakes have a crispy texture that is directly recognizable.
Vegetables and mushrooms are combined in the tempura, and there are four varieties of delicious delicacies such as the buckwheat noodles mixed with the soba of Kagoshima.
Vegetables are homemade in the vegetable greenhouses and sold at supermarkets and convenience stores within the prefecture.
Vegetables change with the season, but fortunately, Ms. Tsukushi has a French culinary training and adds color with dishes such as ratatouille.
On the other hand, there is the "taste that has been eaten for a long time" (Hanbatsan), which the generations have enjoyed.
The popular "Hamburger made with domestic beef" (1000 yen) is also available.

Safety I thought it was safe because there were people around and I slowed down, but completely stopped depending on the situation.
The view around me is painful, but it's painful in a good way. It's painful in a good way because it's something that can be seen.
Overall, it was not bad, but there was still room for improvement.
Whether there are many people or not, if there are considerations such as sending to the end, it will become easier to use.
Specifically, it is thought to be a good idea to make a dedicated lane and not let the devil of the person who is walking pass.
However, there were only a few people, so I thought it would be better if there were more people.
In the future, automatic driving will become mainstream. The wacky feeling that the future will surely come and the pain of the surrounding visual line were quite tolerable, but it was quite difficult to carry.

One man was killed and another man fled on a motorcycle on the 12th. Saga prefecture murder case | Incident / Accident | Saga News News | Saga News LIVE
At around 1:25 p.m. on the 12th, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka Prefecture was stabbed with a sharp object by a man in his 30s to 40s on the road of Daiyacho, Saga City.
The man fled on a bicycle and the Saga Prefectural Police are looking for him in connection with a suspected murder.
According to the Kanto Regional Police Headquarters, there were 110 cases where pedestrians said "I don't care."
The man was about 10 centimeters tall and 1 centimeter thick, but he was conscious.
The man who fled had a tattoo on his chest.
A knife believed to have been used in the crime was found nearby.
The male was known to be drinking with a number of people, and inquiries are being made about some kind of traffic obstruction between the male pedestrian and the male cyclist.

A family with a long history of environmental protection activities in China's border areas (JBpress - Yahoo! News)
Cai Tongyu (Cai Tongyu: Find Asia Entrepreneur Consultant of Hong Kong Enterprises) China, which has a vast land area, is also important in terms of biological diversity. There are about 5,000 species of mammary gland-bearing animals in the world, of which 500 are found in China, and there are about 30,000 species of plants in the world, of which 3,000 are found in China.
Through recognizing the value of biodiversity as a self-governing entity, there are regions where environmental protection activities are promoted not only by the self-governing entity but also by environmental activists.
Sichuan Province in southwestern China is also one such region.
Her younger sister, Li Yingying, is currently active as a model. Xishuangbanna is located in a region where the borders of Laos and Myanmar meet, and is the hometown of the "Dai (Tai)" ethnic group, which shares the Tai Yuan and Lue people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through countries in Southeast Asia, can be found here.
Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region in southwest China's Yunnan Province covers an area of just 0.2 percent of China's total, but it is home to about 25 percent of China's wild animal species and 20 percent of its plant species.
This time, I would like to talk about the environmental protection activities of Mr. Li Zhuangguo, who is doing his best in Shexuanna.
A German couple started environmental protection activities together - it has been 20 years since they started environmental protection activities.
What was the cause of that?
Mr. Li, our environmental protection activity "Tianyin" began in 2000.
That's my husband, Josef Margraf.
The husband is from Germany and came to Cambodia for a cooperative scientific project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only hot and wet tropical rainforest in China, and boasts a rich biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, the economic development was sluggish.
As a result, in order to establish industries in the region, China had to produce synthetic rubber, which was in short supply domestically. Therefore, the large-scale felling of the tropical rainforest advanced.
The husband was sent here from Germany for the restoration of natural resources and the study of biological resources.
And here I am, married to the man I was interviewing.
Did Mr. Li not have an interest in natural conservation before?
Mr Li I am a native of Xishuangbanna, but I am not interested in the significance and biological diversity of tropical rainforests.
That's why it became a project to promote the knowledge.
Even if you have a nice face or a high back, there are people who can't help but stare.
A popular actor said.
Ora is not that kind of person.
It is a moment when you have confidence in yourself.
That person surely has a strong confidence inside.
High-performance, high-quality running gear is a craftsman's handmade.

But do you think it's rude to comment on someone's outfit?
Is that all right?

I don't think so.
Since there was nothing said in detail, I don't know what it means.
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.
What would happen if Sakurajima confessed?
I told Sakurajima that my heart was overflowing with spring, and thank you.
And to complete it, I would like to increase my knowledge of golf and share my love for the game with others.
However, if you do not open the NISA account, will it be possible to open it at a convenient time later?
At the same time, those who opened accounts will have their procedures completed earlier.

In addition, I would like to recommend the simultaneous opening of NISA accounts, which can be used at any time.

【Memorandum/Personal】MOD self-contained environment became the cause of CTD, and it took about a month and a half to identify the cause.
There was not enough time to play back the data, which was stable until March, because there were multiple reasons for CTD to occur during the period when it was not easy to play back the data from GW.
Why wasn't the log analyzed with the .Net Script Framework (I'll bet you can figure it out in a few minutes)? Some errors in the .dll series and the mash-related are left without crash logs.
The main timing of CTD
* All PAPILS and .NET Script Framework, and the log of the remaining type of .dll plug-ins.
* When an NPC is killed/attacked repeatedly: The console kill command is activated even in single-player mode. Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/powerofthree's SE update revised version) OFF to improve *Is it possible to get wet?
When the camera work for initiating the Kurumu's attack on an NPC is activated, the Kurumu setting can be turned off via the .ini file. However, the maximum number of DAR animations is less than 10,000.
* (Outside the basic house) When moving the field and casting a magic (for example, freeze run), NPC hit: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID usage NPC application settings (MCM right upper) are all OFF.
Is it a result of additional armor and body mesh settings for an actor/NPC? In addition, the default SPID usage in the 2.0 SPID.ini has a syntax error, but the result is intended to apply the Perk to the NPC.
At first, we focused on wet shirt attacks and motion/battle MODs related to OnHit (the .dll files).
At least English, German and French levels, there were no similar bug reports.
There are many people who have the same CTD problem in the Japanese language environment. It may be useful to refer to this.
Everyone is talking about it,
Around it, there is nothing remarkable, and even his colleagues are relatives.
Take a look around and that guy looks like he's full of energy and working hard - in a cool way.
But both of them seem to be mentally unstable.
I'm not retiring mentally, but I thought there was a limit before retiring.
Thinking about the importance of psychiatric consultation for nursing care - Today's visiting nursing care has ended
As I suffer from bipolar disorder, I have been undergoing long-term nursing care, but I have been able to build a good relationship with the nurse (female) who has been taking care of me during this period.
We talk about different things every week.
Of course, we can talk about the things that are necessary for drug management (such as packaging), but more than that, as a person who has a mental illness, how important it is to have enjoyable communication was what I thought about during today's visit to the nursing home.
Today, we talked about the difference between men and women in a joking manner.
As for the topic of men and women's sexual desire, or how she got divorced, such conversations are inappropriate.
I've been mistaken for a woman before.
However, if the nursing care station where the visiting nurses worked in the Department of Psychiatry was not manned, the visiting nurses who used to work in the wards would not be able to respond to the matter, and the visiting nurses who worked in the nursing care would say, "This is because we are doing medical care," and so on.
The visiting dental surgery I use is run by a charity, so it's a small one staffed by volunteers, but I think of Frank when I see the dentist.
I'm a beautiful woman.
Patients who have undergone psychiatric examination and nursing care will also be seen, and those who are considering it will also be seen.
Visiting the toilet is very important for people with mental illness.
Please take it if the doctor says so.
And choose a good visiting hairdressing station.
Previously, even if I was angry, I couldn't do anything. There were also things that I couldn't do even if I wanted to.
I'm sorry.
I knew it was a false alarm because I speak English.
Why do you speak English?
There are various reasons, for example...
It is not known what the person who made it said in Japanese.
・Inadequacy of language judgment
・The browser is set to English
The ranking with fewest occurrences in the top 6 is all a perfect square,
Why are there so many of them?
I'm surprised.
There is a pattern somewhere.
It goes on and on.
The telephone network was down due to the corona virus.
But I cannot concentrate on my work at home.
I'm sorry, I couldn't help but touch it.
It's hard to make any progress with coffee.
What are you all up to?
I'm laughing because I can't stop smiling.
I feel like I can do anything as long as I'm with you.
Same goes for touching the cash register.
South Korea's patent on hydrogen technology, China's 5-minute 1... "Hydrogen Economy Load Map Delay" (Central Japan Newspaper in Japanese) - Yahoo! News
The South Korean government announced a hydrogen economic map in 2019.
By 2022, it aims to popularize 65,000 fuel cell vehicles, operating 310 hydrogen stations across the country.
The target price of hydrogen was set at 6,000 yen ($57.70) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, the number of fuel cell vehicles did not reach 27% of the target (about 17,000 vehicles).
The popularity of the hydrogen station of the core infrastructure reached 38% (about 117 places) of the target, and the price of hydrogen per kilogram was 8,400 yen, which was almost the same as the load map announced at that time.
It has been recognized that the performance of the government's hydrogen economic load map is worse than the target value.
On the 12th, the National Federation of Economic Associations (Nippon Keidanren) released a report entitled "Current Situation of Hydrogen Economy and Policy Direction."
According to the report, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on the United States and Japan.
Carbon fiber, the core material of the fuel cell vehicle, is supplied by Toray (Japan), Ketjen (Japan), Dupont (U.S.), Goodyear (U.S.) and 3M (U.S.).
The number of patents on hydrogen technology in six countries leading the world's hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% per year (from 2014).
South Korea ranks fifth in the world in terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (2014-2020).
However, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce said that "in fact, six countries account for the majority of the world's sulfur market, and in reality, these countries are ranked lower."
The national patent rankings are China, the United States, EU, and Japan.
Since 2017, China has overtaken the United States to become the world's largest economy.
The number of patents registered in 2020 was 1,033 for Korea and 974 for Japan, but China (4,721) had a 22% threshold over Japan.
Japan Atomic Energy Commission has proposed to designate "national strategic technologies" which have a large reduction effect on the investment tax credit for equipment and research and development of hydrogen technology.

U.S. and Assistance Weapons Arrive in Ukraine (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
（CNN） Authorities from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on the 12th that small arms and ammunition including grenade and ammunition were delivered to Ukraine based on the assistance plan for security approved by Bihac.
Military aid amounted to $60 million (around 6.8 billion yen), which was considerable, and the last equipment, including four radars for identifying the launch sites of missiles such as the Smerch, was exported to Ukraine.
According to the Carnegie Reporter of the U.S. Department of Defense, these assistance included death-causing weapons such as the tank-mounted missile "Javelin".
The military support is aimed at strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities, including the increase of Russia's military forces around the Ukrainian border.
The U.S. has warned Russia against any military moves and is consulting with NATO allies on a response if Russia does invade eastern Ukraine.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who visited the White House on September 1 this year, admitted the use of weapons when he met with US President Donald Trump.
U.S. military assistance to Ukraine reached about $45 million this year.
Russia's aid to Ukraine's Crimea peninsula has risen above $2.5 billion.
The US military also follows the training schedule of the Ukrainian military.
Last month, it sent troops from the U.S. state of Florida to participate in a multinational joint training program in support of Ukraine.
According to the statement of the US Department of Defense, the US European Command has played a significant role in the training and advice of the Ukrainian special forces.
The number of U.S. special forces operating in Ukraine is classified.
Vladimir Putin, the leader of Russia, had an online conversation with the president of Ukraine on the 7th of this month, but the tense situation between the two countries was eased.
If the United States is attacked, a harsh economic sanction will be imposed.

Pre-death donations are "banned" and donations and taxes are "adjusted" at the same time. Aiming at this, Akira Amari, the former Minister of Economic Regeneration and Minister of Economic Regeneration and Minister of Reconstruction, Liberal Democratic Party.
The first special issue of Weekly Diamond on December 18th is titled "Family talk at the beginning and end of the year!"
It is "pre-death donation and bequeath".
In the midst of debate over the integration of the consumption tax and the income tax, a draft of the 2022 tax reform was presented, but in the near future, the pre-paid income tax, which is considered to be the king of consumption tax countermeasures, may become "inaccessible".
How will the rules change?
Together with the direct hit to the former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's tax commission and a member of the House of Representatives, Akira Amari, you will learn the basics of tax reduction techniques that can be used during the year.
（Diamond Editing Department, Miyahara Takeshi）
From the asset owner to the company staff in the urban department The pre-gift donation can be used as a "gagging order". From the perspective of taxing the succession tax and donation tax more integrally, the establishment of a neutral tax system for the selection of the timing of the transfer of assets is aimed at.
In a draft of the 2021 tax reform plan announced by the ruling party last year, large-scale movements were seen not only among the rich but also in the middle class.
The reason for this is that what they say amounts to changing the rules mid-game and outlawing the "pre-established donation" that is a cornerstone of the war on successive taxes.
The ironclad tax increase is "to reduce the taxable assets that become the target of the tax."
The most generous pre-death donation was made possible by the fact that the benefactor owned a home in one of the three major metropolitan areas.
Such a discussion on the integration of consumption tax and income tax.
The 22nd Tax Reform Draft, which was unveiled on December 10 and which had been under consideration as the fastest way to introduce a consumption tax, stated that "it is necessary to see through the current concurrent accounting tax system and the annual gift system." "The non-taxable portion of the gift tax is a system that does not impose any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family (in short)," and so on. The guidelines for integration, which have been repeatedly issued based on the view that the tax burden should not be imposed on the transfer of assets within the family, have been issued.
In the investigation of this edition, the former Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Commission and the former Chief Cabinet Secretary, Akira Amari, said.
It is a very big deal to lose the advantage and disadvantage in the period of asset transfer.
Underneath that, what are the issues that are going to come out as a result of integration (are being addressed) in the simulation that we're doing?
In any case, in the near future, it would be a mistake to invalidate advance payments as a tax measure.
However, what will change specifically in the rules of succession tax and donation tax?

The broadcast of "My Correct Big Brother" will start on January 10, 2022. Gou Takaishi "Please look forward to it!"
The FOD original drama "My Correct Brother" starring Gokou will be broadcast on January 10, 2022.
【Photos】Hirose Hana as the heroine. The original manga, which was serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" magazine from 2018, was based on the same-titled manga drawn by Mori Etsuko. The story of a man and a woman who are burdened by the past is a pure love love story.
The protagonist's Hirose and the heroine's Yamaguchi work together.
University student Risei meets his predecessor and mentor Hiroshi.
Hiromi, who suffers from insomnia, is a mysterious young man who can fall asleep by borrowing someone else's shoulder.
Lysi, who resembles her father, the brother of the man who divorced both parents, is haunted by the killer's likeness.
Kogawa Yoshitaka commented that the drama "My Correct Brother" will be broadcast from January 10!
I hope those who haven't been able to see FOD will be able to enjoy it. Those who have already seen it will be able to appreciate this work more by knowing the complex psychological portrayals of the sea and the real world, as well as the pictures of the two people who change and grow, Gouda and Ishii.
I'm glad that fans of the original work are enjoying it.
Looking forward to it!

NFL: Team won 3 passes in 1 game. What were the players feeling like (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
Jones threw just three passes all night, completing two of them for touchdowns.
This is the first time in the past 50 years that the Bills have posted back-to-back wins over the Jets since Weeks 3 and 4 of the 1974 season.
In 1974, the Rams had the legendary O.J. Simpson, who set a then-NFL record with 2,003 yards rushing in the season.
Bilic had Simpson and another RB, Marcus Blakeston, to thank for that.
The biggest reason for the extremes in Pithiviers was the weather.
Buffalo, a town near the Canada-U.S. border, has not changed its geographical location from the Straits of the Arctic Ocean.
And on this day, the temperature rose by almost 1 degree Celsius and the wind speed was 18m/s, which blew the snow away.
The buildings were all in the local area and there were no major changes to the line-up.
The lap time is 25 seconds for 30 laps.
Arlen's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
Interceptions were not made, and it was impossible to intercept.
There were four Red Zone invasions in the 10-game offensive series and one field goal was made.
In particular, it continued to advance to the red zone for three consecutive times in the third quarter.
However, it only won 3 points in 3 games.
Goal before the final whistle.
The building chased 4 points and became 3rd & 9.
The goal is 18 yards.
On 3rd and 14, QB Allen was surrounded by rushers in the pocket and threw a right pass out of the pocket.
And Endzone's Teddson Nocks tried to pass but failed.
On this play, Eagles WR Stefon Diggs was wide open for a touchdown in the end zone on the right side, but Allen never saw him.
On 4th & 18, Allen targeted WR DeVier Posey in the left corner of the end zone, but the pass was deflected by DB Mike Bray in the end zone for an interception to end the drive.
Brian was covering WR Calvin Ridley of the Falcons with a man-to-man coverage, but released the coverage and reacted to Allen's movement in the middle.
Allen, who lost two receivers, threw two end zone passes to reach the end zone.
The fourth-down conversion was a make-or-miss play, but the third-down conversion was a must-do to keep the drive alive.
It is possible to win the first down in two plays.
Since it was only 2 minutes, if I went to the 4th & Short, I couldn't help but feel that Alen's ability to run was a must.

Three items that you can put in the kitchen for a long time when you "throw away" and "replace" (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
No matter how frequently it is replaced, it is unlikely to be replaced as frequently as it is recommended.
A 2017 study found that even when kitchen sponges were sterilized with an electronic razor, bacteria were still able to breed in them (which is why sterilizing them with an electronic razor is a good thing).
German researchers who carried out the study recommend sponging the teeth once a week to keep them clean.
Mana board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said that it would be better to replace the warped and cracked panels.
It becomes difficult to keep the wound clean and free from infection because bacteria can grow quickly.
For heavily soiled dishes, fill a 1-gallon (3.8-liter) container with water and add a tablespoon of liquid dish soap. Swirl the container to dissolve the soap, then fill it with hot water and let it sit overnight.
Immerse the surface of the liquid mannequin for several minutes.
The water is so clean that you can cut it with a paper towel.
Missing or broken dishes
While it may be uncomfortable to break a favorite mug, the exposed surface will become a new petri dish for bacteria and yeast.
This can also be caused by biting or cutting the lips, or having something stuck in the mouth.
So, the chance to buy a new and improved mag!

According to MSI's blog, it will last for about 5 minutes, but will not end even after 1 hour.

The "Equivalent Exchange of Efforts" is a human song <v>The "Equivalent Exchange of Efforts"</v> is a human song (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
Among the recent manga, "The Edge of the Demon" is different from other manga in that "the training is intense".
There are no battles, and even in the daytime it is gloomy. The editor-in-chief has become a byword for a work that lacks reader popularity.
It was two years since the end of "One Piece" manga's Skypiea arc, during which the anime cut off at the cliffhanger of the Straw Hats being stranded on a deserted island. However, from the fact that the anime abruptly ended leaving only the cliffhanger, it can be surmised.
One of the attractions of walking on land reclaimed from the sea is the exoticism of the place, and it is true that there are times when staying in the same place and carrying out repairs feels better.
The protagonist of "The Edge of Tomorrow," Tom Cruise's character, Sergeant Rita Vrataski, takes a seat on the ground in a puddle of her own blood, thinking of how she tried to take her own life, only to be rescued by a higher power. "To seize the right of killing and being killed by others!".
The weak have no rights and no choice but to be exploited by the strong.
And so, introducing the "apprentices" who hope to join the Kidou Team is a courageous act.
The first contact between Tsukiji and Kazuki was "What should I do when my little sister eats a person?", and Tsukiji's answer was "It's too early to judge."
Even among fans, there is a lively exchange of opinions.
But the possibility that a moment will come when you have to judge whether to lead your sister, who turned into a monster, cannot be denied.
It's an idea from the gut.
However, the man who has not yet completed his probation, Tomohiro Yamashita, was taken to the mountains and thrown down the cliff like a tuna.
The mountain is covered with caves and pits where people have fallen to their deaths, and traps where they have been impaled.
Despite that, the keen sense of hearing allows the protagonist to eavesdrop on the conversations of others, and he tries to avoid them by any means.
Still, "I can avoid it all of a sudden because my physical ability has improved so much!" says Tsuchiya.
Ordinary people can suddenly become strong without any conspiracy, and it is only natural that they become aware of it.
To those who worked hard, a report will be given, but there is no report for those who did not work hard. The "equivalent exchange of effort" that does not praise people who did not work hard but only those who made an effort is different from the superhuman praise song that has no root.

Samsung Electronics of South Korea set up a new "DX department" integrating home appliances and mobile, emphasizing "user experience" (WoW! Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following the integration of the CE and IM departments as set departments, Samsung Electronics decided to call the device DX (Device Experience), and announced it on the 12th.
Through a variety of services from mobile to home appliances, the purpose is to enhance user experience (Experience).
Samsung Electronics has clarified that the newly established DX department, which combines the CE and IM departments, is composed of business departments such as VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and network.
A spokesman for Samsung Electronics said that "this name change reflects our long-term business structure and future direction, as well as the strengthening of global leadership."
In addition, products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communications equipment, of course, reflected the needs of customers through the service solution that optimized the experience of consumers.
Taking advantage of the launch of the integrated leader ship system, the strategy of creating and differentiating products and services based on the synergy effect beyond the scale of the entire company was also reflected in the name.
Already, Samsung Electronics has conceived a strategy to enable users to freely access content and services through the connection between devices, based on multi-device experience (MDE), which encompasses the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).

There are problems with it, but the natural science documentary "desu/masu style" where the voice is low is not appropriate.
I want to express it more strongly.
They lie with their jaws open, ready to strike, only their armoured heads protruding from the sand... anything that falls into their pit is impaled and dragged beneath.
Hanmiao young insects always wait for the prey in the sand, and only the round head part can be seen from the sand.
This is a little unnatural.
The larvae of the sand flea wait in the sand for prey, with only the round head protruding.
I thought it should be done.
The thing is...

24 clashes in Aichi. The trailer driver was not ill (Television Asahi (ANN) - Yahoo! News)
The driver of the trailer, which crashed into the 24 vehicles in the prefecture of Aichi, was not sick, and it was judged that the accident was caused by some carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles including trucks and passenger cars collided on National Route 41 in Shoubei City, and 12 people were injured.
The police initially caused a traffic accident and arrested the suspect, a 71-year-old man, on suspicion of having run over the victim with a trailer. On the morning of the 12th, the suspect was sent to the prosecutor's office.
The suspect's trailer continued to drive with the brakes on even after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the suspect lost consciousness right after the accident.
However, according to the investigators, the suspect was not suffering from any disease, and some carelessness is suspected to have caused the accident.
Police are conducting a thorough search of the premises and are investigating the circumstances of the incident.

Oguni's Beef Ribs Review [Comic Issue 4] (Weekly Play News) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superman Olympiad, which started in the third volume, comes to a close in this fourth volume!
The previous chapter, which sketched the match from the opening to the decisive match, focused on only one match.
Volume 4 of "Beef Man" Reviewed by Oginuma X (5 stars) Superhuman pro wrestling has already started before the match!
This volume merely outlines the final showdown between the beefy man and the masked wrestler, but the first thing to note is that it is not a complete volume, covering only the matches on the first night's card.
Starting from the imprint, we have been changing our tactics and trying various things, such as our partnership and special training scenes, but we cannot help but feel that this is a decisive battle.
The mounting tension of the feeling that a century's worth of battles is about to begin is steadily building up in the midst of this work, and I am sure that the reader's tension is rising in line with this.
And for the first time in the history of the tournament, a decisive battle for the third place will be held before the final match.
Despite its lavishness as a fighting card, the thing I like most is when, as a pre-match distraction, the sumo wrestler on the far side of the ring shouts at the guy with the beef bowl, "From now on, I'll do it better than you!"
And give it a try.
However, there was a scene in which the terrified thief, who was caught red-handed, stopped his knife with his teeth and silently begged for mercy.
This is amazing. Both of them have already withdrawn. There is no chance for them to fight each other at this conference.
But there are times when you just can't help but feel sorry for the guy.
If such a thing were to happen, it would be difficult to imagine a more vibrant future!
It's embarrassing to be a manga artist when a character stands out like that!
Such battles between the two will never end, but the stage is set for a tearjerker of a post-match interview with the sushi chef.
Please don't underestimate the power given by the gods!
That's a relief.
This is a huge metaphorical statement about the work itself, I think. Up until now, I've felt that the reader identifies with the main character, so the main character can't lose, and the strength of the story comes from that.
However, when the ramen man said this, Mr. Yudetamago realized that he couldn't do anything even if he wanted to.
With just these few words, the reader can understand that "Even if it's just a meat man, can he really knock down Robin with just his bare hands?"
What?
It seems that we can imagine the development that was not seen before, and if we look at it from the point of view of another writer, we can see that this is the same kind of ladder that Mr. Yokomitsu, who made the work, put on himself.
This is amazing.
I think this is a big point in this volume.

Today morning, unfortunately...
The power supply of the NAS PC is not working.
It happened.
1.) Open the window for morning and evening.
This is when the PC is being charged.
2.) When you return to the room from the bathroom, you can hear the sound of a pink rotary phone coming from the PC.
At this point, it is considered that the movement of the fan is getting worse due to the low temperature (6℃).
So I tried warming up the room again.
3.) Does not start.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamps flicker for a moment and then stop immediately.
After that, we said nothing.
Even if you pull out the power plug, it just works for a moment.
4.) The motherboard and ATX20 pins are connected, but when you try to remove other parts, it doesn't turn on.
5.) There have been times in the past when PSU fans have been so loud that it sounded like a buzzing or humming. So the question is, was PSU louder because of that?
I found an ATX power supply later and tried it.
Well.
I'm sorry... What should I do?

The first place is occupied by the 5% of the total use of kanji characters!
The first, third and fifth place winners are all cute smiling emojis.
Funny times, happy times, of course!
Even in such a time, there are people who use it self-consciously.
People who don't use emoji even once in the top 10 are rare.
