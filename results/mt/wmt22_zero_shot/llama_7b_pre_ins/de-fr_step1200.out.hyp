Hello, I already wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and so far have not received a reply.
It's about my wardrobe which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#)
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is not currently in use.
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again.
A variable PWM frequency of 10kHz to 50kHz, which can be set, ensures particularly quiet operation in bell-type motors – the characteristic “buzzing” is a thing of the past.
The load regulation can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique 'Autotune' function allows automatic calibration of the decoder to the engine.
The LokSound 5 decoder delivers with up to 1.5A motor current enough juice even for older motors.

In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York defeated Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Free entry for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg fan day
The Europa Park, named after the Europa Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park communicated, members and long-term card holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and snacks.
The rollercoaster trains shone red and white on this day through the T-shirts.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s.
The first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park once again showed how well the partnership fits.
Seeing glowing fans having fun on the rollercoaster confirms that," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
I have 5 books in total.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work
But we still want the display module, just a new undamaged one
And don't cancel the whole order.
No, I am unable to obtain another type of packaging.
I will take the cupboard apart and make it available to the transport company.
I can't mount it on the tabletop.
It is a Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with tabletops with a diameter of #NUMBER#
We got a 155cm diameter.
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the fingernail
Child, four years old, has splinters of wood under the fingernail (outside).
They tried to pull him out with a pincer.
Very difficult to grasp.
Did not work and caused pain.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try to do it.
No chance.
I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.
It works.
Many thanks for the help
I wish you a nice evening
I have to print that out and stick it to the package and take it to the post office, right?
Do I have to do anything else here?
Hello, unfortunately I cannot get into the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# to the email address above?
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Will you send me a confirmation by mail?
I have already got that from your colleagues 3 times... how reliable is your information?
When will the shipping company get in touch with me?
It still doesn't work. I can only long for the cover page.
I will not be at the assigned date, the date #PRS_ORG# is picking me up.
As I am not able to be there in person due to a funeral, I am afraid that is not something that can be changed.
Could you please assign me an alternative delivery date.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I will be available again.
“Why children are not tyrants” documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it immediately.
The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and holds lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why our children are becoming tyrants" (2008), he triggered an intense educational debate.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please be warned, the film is tough to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Parents and other carers must never, never, never have power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child room for his development and to make the frame for the child as large as it is possible and meaningful in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
I would like to cancel my order as the wooden table I received is defective.
Body damage due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG.
Also compatible with all printers that use the above-mentioned products according to the manufacturer or user manual.
Over 10 years' experience as a specialist distributor in toner production
All company and brand names and all types mentioned are the property of their respective rightful owners.
Their mention serves only to provide orientation and to point out the compatibility of the goods.
They are not original products of the respective printer manufacturers, but compatible goods.
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG.
The mirror has a scrape in it and the frame also has a fault, which has been attempted to be hidden with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would love to give the mirror back and have already put it back in the package and taped it up.
How do I proceed now for the return journey?
Is there an installation guide?
How long would I have to wait to get these or decide to send them back?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG and they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
I have not been able to buy any books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have started, connected, synchronized and repaired the #PRS_ORG#.
Nothing has helped.
I'm getting the email that my package is coming back to you because of an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG and redirecting it, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again, or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and the order is cancelled again?
Unfortunately, for me that would mean that I would not order again because it has already been waiting for a long time.
Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or just for cuddling – my little warm friend is versatile.
Chestnut-flour pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing warmth, as chestnuts absorb and release heat very well.
The detachable inner cushion can be easily warmed up in the microwave or oven.
The soft connection makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if it's not always going so well for them.
The cherry kernel pillow with reference is suitable exclusively for the following applications:
Before warming up the biscuits, check for unusual smells, stains or burn marks and dispose of them immediately if present.
Please remove the seat cushion to warm it up!
In the microwave at maximum 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (information from the microwave manufacturer)
After heating, spread the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking it!
Then put the inner cushion back in place.
With the first warming, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, which disappears with repeated use.
Make sure to adhere to the given heating instructions, as long periods or high energy levels can lead to damage (fire and combustion danger!).
Check with the microwave's manufacturer to see if heating of grain products is allowed before warming up the cake in the microwave.
After the heated inner cushion was replaced, please check the temperature of the kiss on your forearm to ensure it is suitable for babies (max. 43°C)!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory disorders, fresh hematoma, bleeding and open wounds, and in people with diminished pain perception.
For existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumour illnesses as well as during pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels are released, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and inaccessibly for children.
If the product is applied to babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be regularly checked to rule out overheating!
All serious incidents that have occurred in connection with the product are to be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority in the country where the user is established.
The connection is removable and machine-washable at 30°C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Lahnsteiner Wehr for water rescue: 45,000 euros subsidy from the state
Recently the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, handed over a grant cheque for 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the volunteer fire department in Lahnstein to Lord Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total costs of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to €135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatine is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatine.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they are permanently expecting increasing numbers of call-outs: the boom in hotel barge cruises on the Rhine and Moselle, and the continuing increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure river, are contributing to this.
Here the lower part was damaged, so to speak the part with the loading space.
Is everything going to be taken away again or just the storage space?
What discounts?
I forgot to write my discount code on my last order!
I have done that many times and it does not work.
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
There is no general definition of a low-budget film with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say on the matter:
Un film de bas budget ou un film de bas budget est un film tourné avec peu ou pas de financement d'un studio de cinéma majeur ou d'un investisseur privé.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, for example on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What is it that bothers you?
And what do you not like at all?
I am waiting for a pickup appointment
What do they want to give back, please!
Rouladen Tipps & Tricks
I got loads of great tips last week for the perfect goulash.
There was that at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I've got a taste for it and want to cook a roulade for the first time on New Year's Eve.
I will put a beef fund there tomorrow.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, only a large pot.
And with the voucher?
Otherwise, I am a customer?!
After all, I did receive a defective delivery and I have now paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG chair.
I don't know how high the seat is....
No, it's for all books, which is why the request was made to #PRS_ORG, because it is clearly a general problem
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
A modern microprocessor is responsible for setting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650 K.
Use the current settings in the Flash storage.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simply and intuitively usable.
The light emits a very high light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120-degree beam angle, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively short distance, is excellent.
Incidentally, also in reporters' situations in small rooms or short distances.
They can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the light to be controlled remotely in TV studios or if the light is installed in hard-to-access locations.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
In addition, there is a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery).
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To make the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, it is simply covered by pressing one of the storage buttons for a long time and finished.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
One of the DL3120's greatest strengths is its ability to work with rechargeable batteries.
These are often in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before setting up whether the batteries have enough power - it's a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments, a value appears in both display screens (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlights with power via the supplied network cable.
The assembly of the headlight is very easy.
They have a 16mm thread to fix them in place, so you can attach them directly to your tripod.
The inclination can be accurately set using levelers on both sides.
It was important that the mechanical components are extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a steering damper is included in the delivery.
The fact that a bag is also included in the delivery is great.
So you can transport or store the light and all its accessories without any problems.
Air pumps are ideal for supplying additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via an air hopper.
This series is available in 3 versions from us.
Have a look at the bottom of the table.
You can compare the performance there.
If the pumps are strong enough, an entire plant can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are recommended, so that you can connect more than one drain.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. However, blower pumps are also available to set an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here, a treasure chest, mussel shell or something similar could be mentioned.
The MK series has a special, sound-dampened construction, which ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The blower pump is connected to an exhaust valve 4/6 mm by means of an air hose... and it's off to the races.
The blower pump should be the same, or higher, as the water level and should be installed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a bypass valve should be installed.
Just cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent water from flowing backwards, which is what happens when water is pumped out of the tank.
If the fan is to be installed outdoors, it should be weatherproofed and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps.
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we tell you here on eBay that the processing time is 3 days, the parcels are packed every day and collected every day.
If everything is going well, it's going very quickly.
We just want to be a little cautious so that nobody is left out, just because it took a little longer than usual.
It would be like that, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics sector...and of course, here, no-one is stopping for Corona.
Please don't rate us badly just because of a delay in delivery, which is solely the carrier's responsibility.
Of course you bitch about those services, even though we're saying at the moment, ... they had it fucking tough
This also varies greatly from region to region.
Be nice to no one, stay healthy, and we all hope there are better times ahead.
Could you please send me the three variations by email and tell me how I can reach them again best
Pill problem
Hello ladies,
I hope I'm doing everything right, this is actually my first post after a year on reddit.
My issue: I was forced to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I was experiencing horrendous period pains and debilitating PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it because I already take enough medication for chronic conditions and I can't choose what I take.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had got from 0 to 100 explosively in my last, roughly two-year break, and these were everywhere.
It was so superficial but it really bothered me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years off, it never really normalised.
Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid it this time.
Parfume-free and without fuss is my cosmetics already, but perhaps someone can recommend something to me.
Gynaecologist hasn't taken me seriously and dermatologist appointment is coming soon.
Thank you to everyone who read the book!
Yes, the lovely skin is such a thing.
If Vorbupertär had bad neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then widespread knotty fungus and the acne topic.
I have also tried every possible diet during my Christian illness and have remained on a sugar, milk and meat-free diet because nothing else worked so well.
It can also be the case that hormonally the worm is just in there, but if, like me, you have a building site, you don't really want to go looking for anything else that's wrong.
I already sent you an email which you did not answer.
The question again.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipping company is #NAME#.
I was just calling there.
I was told that they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS_ORG.
Is that so?
If so, I must cancel the order as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture upstairs.
Am I not going to be called?
I had a question to ask
If I have downloaded a book onto the #PRS_ORG, the message comes up Your #PRS_ORG does not authorise this book
Is there a problem there?
Voucher sounds great
Then I'll take care of it automatically with the new order
Thank you for the quick clarification!
Ordinary through child?
Hello, (w32) has been bothering me for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organised (I am self-employed, with little free time), but for as long as I can remember I have struggled to keep on top of my finances.
There are always phases where nothing happens, and then sometimes it gets me and I pack up and clean.
But it's not really "that someone could drop by spontaneously".
My husband (unfortunately) is also not better, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly the budget just loses against work and laziness.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become a decent parent?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it, and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
Because for me it's no incentive, it just doesn't bother me that much, as long as there are no visitors and the fresh clothes are there and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child give you a bigger incentive or do you stay messy?
I look forward to your answers.
I would love to give away a voucher code
just like #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Do they do that?
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: one of the longest in history
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the lava flows have caused great damage on the Canary Island.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, with 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data about earlier outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in recent days, but volcanologists are still not daring to predict when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to state TV channel RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Nearly 1,200 hectares were covered by a metre-thick layer of lava.
That is equivalent to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new landmasses, totalling around 50 hectares, have emerged off the coast thanks to the solidified lava.
Above all, the banana cultivation for the island, which provides employment for around half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants, direct or indirect, was hit hard, and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, with other areas also heavily affected, wrote newspaper "El País".
I have ordered a lamp shade for you, which will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for that and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered another suspension for you.
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping take?
We don't need to be having discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have therefore kept their names.
In German, an equivalent might be the "Dreher", which by no means sounds as delicious.

Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's exit from Formula 1 has been quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn peeled off his gloves and wiped sweat from his brow.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight contact with the wall, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after only half the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, bringing an end to the "Iceman's" career in motorsport's premier class.
To say goodbye, his wife Minttu and their two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 world championship in a Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix, started 18 times from pole position and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
If that doesn't work, I'd be happy with a legacy or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only for goods worth more than 1,000 euros do I not really need them.
The large main section is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro closures, it adapts to the needs of your photo equipment and is suitable for all types of cameras – from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits into a rucksack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible kit could include a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three changeable lenses, and a pop-up flash.
DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or the Fuji X-T2 allow for the use of additional lenses.
In addition, you can stow away lots of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (Olympus MFT, Fujifilm X-A or E series), you can use the rucksack for your equipment and for things that are photo-unfriendly.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the rucksack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Have you already sat on the #PRS_ORG chairs?
Yes, the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with some of them.
The central beam is held up by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too slender and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The central beam is held up by two feet, which are unfortunately faulty.
The central beam does not fit into the intended support.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent?
No flats.
According to the installation instructions, these are the right ones, they were just too narrow
But who cares?
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
Not flat for me
Could I have received this?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
I have already cut myself on the finger
This is an absolute outrage
Rotring brake discs are designed for the requirements of dynamic drivers who appreciate reliability and safety when braking, even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are cast and then mechanically machined (bored and cut).
All made-to-order glass is produced in short series according to individual technical specifications, which are specific to certain glass and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawings, a special production program is created, which is aimed at extracting the disc according to the properties of the original assembly.
The cast aluminium discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, while scuffs improve the cleaning of brake discs and brake clamps.
Aesthetic features of our tinted glass underline the character of each car through attractive and noticeable appearance.
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is good for big brothers and sisters to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Look for a moment, help for a moment, bring the bottle, etc.
They learn responsibility, help in the family and are included.
As long as they can still have enough children, I see no problem.
If your K1 is occupied for the short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best judge whether this is suitable for your children.
It is not the case that he is to wrap K2 and stay with him for hours as he falls asleep.
It is legally questionable.
Perhaps this is why the psychologist made the statement.
Because if something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to worry about K2.
Whether this is now a risk that you want to take is, of course, your decision ;)
Yes, I already reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have checked the legal situation again and have written to them again.
We actually reported this half a year ago.
but two deep grooves, filled with something yellow, are on the very edge of the wood
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself
I have one more question: the daytime quilt #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in large sizes, for example 240/240?
Hello lovely #PRS_ORG team,
I have already registered under the customer contact with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Thank you for the message
but only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
The protein taken in with the food is broken down into individual amino acids in the bird's gastrointestinal tract, and these are used by the bird to build its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the new feather formation in the growing bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with particularly high demands for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON Bio should not be administered during breeding as it can cause disruptions to the breeding process.
Following this regular gift from NEKTON Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON Bio per 250 ml water or 100 g of forage.
It is only necessary to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes in a day, and to change the water/food daily.
A whisked measuring spoon (inset) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON Bio.
If the feather damage is severe, a double or triple dose of NEKTON Bio may be given initially, until new feather growth becomes visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is given until the new feather formation is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON Bio should be stored dry, without direct sunlight, at a temperature of between 15° and 25°C.
Iran sees progress in negotiations over nuclear deal
According to Iran, progress is being made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear deal.
Both sides are close to reaching an agreement on the topics on the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday, according to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", because initially even agreement on the issues to be negotiated had not been reached.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement had continued after a nearly week-long interruption.
At the negotiations, representatives of Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.

Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and host into space
The daughter of the first US astronaut, a TV presenter and four other passengers went on a short space trip.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of Blue Origin, founded by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed back the newly selected astronauts.
Welcome back," Bezos said, wearing a blue spacesuit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in the air for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the NASA astronaut Alan Shepard, who was launched into space in 1961, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not share how much they paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his deployments.
She just happened to be on the flight, said the 74-year-old with a chuckle.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would love to go back to space already, the host said.
New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometers high
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automatically.
The capsule, separated from the rocket mid-flight, reached an altitude of around 100 kilometres above the earth, at times in weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed by parachutes before landing.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned mission of Blue Origin: In July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot and a 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was there, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's vice president Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of driving the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard for the climate.
DDR model of handicraft E-lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably originates from the modification proposal of the model railway enthusiast ME No. 11/1968, used with traces of play and parts missing, see photos, Functions well, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the German Federal Railways (DRG), conceived for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly originating from the small-scale manufacturer ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working order
In 1924, the German Imperial Railway Company commissioned AEG to come up with proposals for an electric locomotive that should be able to handle 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h on this stretch of track.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Therefore, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as 1’Co+Co1’ locomotive with tapered roller drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All of them survived the Second World War and found themselves back on the territory of the former GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were brought to the Soviet Union as war reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
All six locomotives at the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk (RBA) in Dessau were found to be worthy of restoration.
With the increasing electrification of the middle German network, there was a growing need for locomotives for heavy freight train services, and in 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled, with the other machines serving as spares.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 in larger quantities were preferred to be built up.
Only when it became clear that the E 94 could not be further increased, the E 95 came into focus for processing.
At first the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig Wahren depot.
They arrived at the railway depot in Halle P. in 1960.
They were mostly used on a dedicated circuit between coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
It was not uncommon for guards to stick when shooting.
Then the fireman, who always travelled on this locomotive, had to unlatch the shield with a hammer and wooden wedge while the train was in motion.
Damage to the traction motors was more common and resulted in months of downtime for the locomotive.
As at the end of the 1960s there were enough new build locomotives available and an expansion of the electrified network at that time was not planned, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and with most split-axle locomotives, so that the E 95s were taken out of service.
In addition, the German Federal Railway wanted to staff its electric locomotives with only one man, which would have caused problems in train operation due to the difficulties mentioned above with the machines and the view from the driver's cab.
After being withdrawn in the middle of 1969, the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were followed by the E 95 01, which retired on 5 October 1970.
The new designation 255 001 was never used.
Up until the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a point heating system in the main railway station in Halle.
It took some time for the authorities at the railway to be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive underwent initial external restoration in order to be able to present it at the RAW Dessau vehicle show.
Since then it has been part of the Verkehrsmuseum Dresden as a non-operational museum locomotive.
The locomotive was completed internally in 1986.
The locomotive is cared for at the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995 employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working to restore the locomotive to working order.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented to an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external painting for the first time, where the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
The locomotives were used on the Silesian mountain range railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves reliable in service and required little maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the central German network.
The main area of deployment was initially Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, functioning well, it is necessary to do optical repairs to the locomotive in the owner's work, soiled, with play traces, cellar smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly also comes from the small series manufacturer ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can bear labels and storage traces.
If you extend my voucher I will place a larger order but nevertheless I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected, I could not imagine and have not been able to react to it in a timely manner.
But as a customer I do not accept this damage.
So when could the cupboard be delivered again?
Keeping him is not an option for me...
Extra stress before holiday and weekend weeks
This topic came up for me last week.
I had to use my long weekend to recover from it.
That is why a post is only being put up now.
There is not only stress before big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, at our workplace.
It seems there's one before every holiday period.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is semi-official.
So last week there was a long four-day weekend at home.
What happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
According to emails that had to be sent before the rush hour, orders here, orders there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Why... yes, why?
Because "next week then" after so much time doesn't sound right?
Or because people really want to do so much in a shortened week as they do in a normal week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, I was also pretty annoyed.
Why this self-hostage for holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we don't even get to enjoy them?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all totally independent.
My question is: Are we the only ones, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north too?
That's perfect! Do I need anything else?
They just need the tracking number in my email?
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees money for vaccination.
In doing so, they are in line with social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into calls for vaccination - following the German example - is also intended to increase people's willingness to have the Corona vaccine.
I'd already had a huge argument with you when I ordered the #PRS_ORG # wardrobe.
I'm for everyone using pronouns
I have sent an application.
Today the invitation to a talk arrived by e-mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
But unfortunately the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and according to where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can someone please help me?
I am an immigrant and do not want to insult any civil servant.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none left.
Now they are back in stock and I would like to add the two chairs to my order and have it invoice.
When did the deadline expire?
According to the law on distance selling, I have a right to withdraw for a period of one month.
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, together with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something enchanting about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important, then, to be conscious of the Christmas gift-giving tradition, so that the act of giving, which according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-keeping "social contract of primitive peoples", can escape the constraints of routine and be infused with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became Christkind
In strict terms of speaking, it was the Protestants who bound the Christmas days closely with the giving of presents.
Previously, gifts were presented on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, threw three women a bag of gold through their window one night so that they could live another life in sin.
This unconventional way of giving birth to the German custom of filling children's shoes with gifts.
Protestants objected to this practice because they rejected the idea of intermediaries between God and human beings as "idolatry."
For these reasons, they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of the giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such details as crucial, only a few are still annoyed that the custom of Saint Nicholas is still as firmly a part of Advent as Martin's day with Martin's singing and Martin's procession.
Today, one can find boots by the door and socks under the Christmas tree, ranging from what the heart desires all the way to coveted luxury watches.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of giving on the day of St. Nicholas that goes back to the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the giving of gifts shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all the Christian countries, however, there reigns a happy hubbub over the question of who is now going to bring the gifts for the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region as to whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas man, who is in essence a kind of Nikolaus, does.
This includes his white beard, which has little in common with the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the three kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who brought some fame.
It's not reindeer pulling his sleigh, it's three horses pulling a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing out the presents.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the foam out.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this is returned and that I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
Yes, I think so, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Ref: Lesson planning (EK)
Hello dear colleagues and students,
I have been teaching in the Ref since the summer, which I enjoy, but I currently have great difficulty planning my lessons in geography in a timely manner.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so in principle I can only use the whiteboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school I can only copy in black and white for free (which makes geography nervous).
At the moment I simply need a long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently talking about geofactors, and for me, every hour is actually a separate issue.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand I don't want to invest too much time even for simple lessons (I also need that for UBs etc.).
When planning, I always start with the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build this up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can show me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really be happy.
Career in social work - as someone with a personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am noticing more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have already been considering for a long time to start again and study social work.
The problem: I have a self-doubting (or fearful) personality disorder (PD).
In short, it means that I have no self-esteem and am correspondingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it's very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I've been told I come across as unapproachable (which I believe I am getting better at).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth centre, rather in examples such as drug counselling or family support.
But I don't know if the actual working day is really like I imagine it to be, and it's hard to find out online.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems (for me, emotionally) in my job because every time it pulls me down when there is something to be criticised in my code ("just the simplest things messed up again") and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know by now how that goes"/"I'm taking him off work with my stupid questions"/"he has to put up with me" etc.).
I probably will have problems in any profession but I wanted to mention it.
I searched for a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.
I was told one would be sent to me.
Since I haven't received any yet (not even in the SPAM folder), I wanted to ask now how long this usually takes.
Many thanks.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her latest novel "Daheim" ("Home") on Friday evening in the sold-out Blue Note, and also acted as host.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and is attuned to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I received my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has a print.
The first delivery was the same color as on the website.
We are very disappointed!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The goods cost under 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value in goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# wholesale customer and therefore it is not a problem for me.
All I need is a number or instruction as to what to do with the package so it can be tracked as your return.
Could you please find the title of a book for me?
I read a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can remember almost all of the plot, but the title completely escapes me. Does anyone know it?
The story was about fear and how to overcome it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself with food and going into the enclosure with his lions.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, accuses his therapist of running a clinic where he treats fear patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and goes to this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to visit the site of every suicide and document it and put the photos online.
In any case, it emerges that this therapist is actually operating some kind of underground therapy group where patients have a chip implanted in their brain which suppresses an anxiety centre in the brain and, ultimately, the patients confront their fears in the most extreme way possible.
(a woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to death on purpose)
This is described in the book as "the fight".
In the end, there's a huge showdown at the hospital that had a fire.
That's the gist of it. I'm pretty sure the book was written by a French author.
If anyone knows of this act or even someone who can reveal the title of the book I would be very grateful.
Sometimes it was completely different: I noticed at school that many religion teachers did not believe in God and it was just another subject for them like maths or geography.
For me, this was always something strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always believed somehow.
How do you feel about it?
Maybe you can also tell stories from work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate the two.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be odd to have a physics teacher who did not believe in relativity theory.
What brings someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Culture or something like that?
Hope your question is not too private.
Hello, have you already sat on the #PRS_ORG chairs?

Car crashes into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had collided with an island in the middle of the road on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for reasons as yet unclear, and then driven onto the wrong side of the road, according to police.
There was a head-on collision with a car driven by a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then crashed into a tree and the man in the car crushed.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least there was hope for youngster Johannes Patrick.
Again nothing: For the second time within not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick looked back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our bellies."
After the game, however, she did not give up - but rather increased it again to 61:72 (28: 38) - defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereas more than just the result itself was disappointing.
Representative is a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-quarter mark was a mere 13 percent, 4 tries (all by young Johannes Patrick) versus 31 attempts - any more questions?
The response came from John Patrick: "After the victory in Tenerife, we were simply not concentrated enough and did not implement what we had trained."
To move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people.
Only 750 spectators were allowed into the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they certainly got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team to victory.
The best playmaker that I have ever coached, praised Gleim.
Patrick's team, on the other hand, was led in scoring by Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7).
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came within eight points after they had already lagged behind by 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for arguing.
The giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt already on Wednesday (8 p.m.), with a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
I had already given everything their colleague seminar o. ä.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was replied to my concern.
I had to keep working and answering the phone, and suddenly everything was gone ...
It doesn't help much because I've been waiting since September.
Is the full amount refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
To ensure the paint application is even and clean, you should clean the parts with soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you take the brush with a new color on the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the non-existent inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
A light overlap of the color layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid fast back and forth wiping with the brush.
This results in unrealistically large areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones could shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come to a close with a separate brush.
Otherwise, there can be ugly metal streaks when you mix them with normal colours.
Leave the painted parts to dry for a day before installing them.
The models achieve an authentic look through the decals or stickers.
From airplane insignia to ship names to custom decals on automobiles: Decals give the model the final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the parts are still easily accessible.
A plane's cockpit can be furnished before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and nail clippers is time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each individual decal and apply it to the surface.
Decals are also called water transfer images, because you just moisten their back with water for a few seconds until the carrier paper turns dark with the water.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also wet beforehand).
While you're holding the decal in place on the model with a tool, you peel the carrier paper away from the side.
Warning: Always check that the picture is stuck down properly before you peel it off the paper, to make sure it doesn't stick to your fingers, knit or tear.
Draining excess water with a towel.
Warning not suitable for children under 3 years
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation.
I already had the duvet in my shopping basket and could now buy it!
What should I do?
To put it quite clearly.
RBTV has made many promises.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
Well, it is simply the case that the politics of this station have long been a shambles.
Almost every format is sponsored (OK), but then to go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one was an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: You don't want to be "a running newspaper stand".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertiser trying to bring its Billie Merch to the elite fan.
And then there are Marah's do's and don'ts.
The obviously don't apply to Simon and Etienne.
They can of course continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and is trying to make an ash of the action with the exploded rented rooms at the expense of the action.
How do you find all that?
It's great if you like it, I find it horrific.
Tyre choice on a racing bike - really that foolproof?
This morning, I woke up full of energy to go for a bike ride because I wanted to at least do a little bit of training for my bike trip next week.
Said, done and I rode my bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40 km were really beautiful - but then that happened which always lurks in every city centre (this time: thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud squeaking and my rear tyre definitely didn't want to participate any more for the rest of the stretch.
As I didn't really have time on the weekday to get a proper spare jacket and hose, I had to make do with half-hearted good cheer and take the first train back home.
It was also not that bad mood-wise, perhaps it is even better if I do the tire change again before the bike ride.
But now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me.
As I have a relatively long stretch ahead of me over several days, I would be extremely unhappy if I got this problem more often.
Now it's not so bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who rode 120km that day until 2pm when I picked up the bike!) and he also described them as suboptimal because he had ridden on them for years.
But if I think about the fact that I have to change my tyre after 80-90km, I am really in a bad mood:D
Now I am talking to an older man at the platform, who asks me why I do not have the Marathon Plus tyres; they are supposed to be unbeatable.
Now, of course, it all sounds very tempting.
But are they really indestructible?
I'm not really in the mood to spend €40/tyre just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I think I have 25 gears on my bike at the moment.
There are also (apparently) wider tyres for the Marathon Plus, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend another tyre for a racing bike?
The swallow side seems to be my absolute! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you already in advance for the help and loving greetings!
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the
Contact has been made with the haulier to collect the wrongly delivered table.
Up to now I have not received any message.
I request immediate settlement.
I have now been writing to the third support staff member, and with none of them have I got further than a promise that an email would be my confirmation.
It is the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#

The "drive" of a tube output stage is a major contributor to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfected by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level and also the distortion content of your sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers in the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows the sound level to be reduced without changing anything on the "gain" and distortion.
Further up, it sounded as if it were even possible to use the POWER LEVEL control to create a reserve of performance.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line out.
The signal applied here is processed with a boxing simulation, so that even when using a headset or direct recordings, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
AUX input can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so you can jam to your favourite tunes.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice recorder.
Anyone who also buys a VFS5 foot controller can conveniently call up the sounds using their feet, switch the effect blocks on/off and change the tempo of the compatible effects "by tapping".
This is actually indispensable for live deployment.

The rectification of the defect, which we have acknowledged as guarantee-requiring, is effected by us repairing the defective tool free of charge or replacing it with an undamaged tool (if applicable, with a successor model).
Replacement tools or parts become our property.
Can I cancel my order now and deliver at the beginning of June?
They can tell their manager that they now have lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
In any case, the 24-month guarantee applies.
Thank you, I have found it
Unfortunately, it still does not work
Serious "skinhead" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by someone from Amberg, viewers of the BR television programme "Wir in Bayern" were prompted to think hard.
But, unlike on many previous days, the term "Host mi?" did not go unanswered this time.
No, it was not a "nervous person".
And also nobody, "who has to go quickly".
That, people heard from the TV presenter, is completely wrong.
On which the man from Amberg revealed the solution and probably also caused many people in Upper Palatinate for surprise.
The viewer learns that "the braggart is a rag, with which someone wipes the stove".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the well-known dialect word "Houdern".
Which closed a educational gap - probably for many who already live in the Amberg area for a long time.
I am fed up with Sky Sport F1
Hello lovely F1 fans, over the course of the season the quality on the German Sky has been getting worse and worse so I thought I'd take a little break with this post.
First of all, the transmission was terminated in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 previews punctually.
It was behind schedule due to the delayed start and the accident, but they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes, and the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it is the case that for legal reasons F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky DE had no choice here.
Still, dumb, especially as Sky UK has decided to broadcast the race live.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartyes accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was more confusion in F1 with commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, who did not know that you are allowed to change tyres under a red flag.
Although there was a similar situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the decision that Verstappen can change his tyres only when there were appropriate radio messages on this subject to Hamilton.
Both commentators on Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was an option for Verstappen.
I think such basic rules should be known if you are commentating on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first time that something that is now allowed or mandatory according to the rules is simply a constant source of uncertainty when it comes to the rules.
In general, Roos does not like the artificial commentary style, but it is a matter of taste.
But I actually prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL.
On top of that, there are constant foolishnesses that make both of them appear unprofessional, as ordering coffee for the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter is causing a lot of unrest in the commentary, which he obviously does not take seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky - in the closing stages, Sky is the only channel that goes to advertising, so on F1TV, you have to listen to the German commentary without the commentary.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also do less advertising in training than Sky, and as a free-to-air channel.
While one must commend Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programme is also very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster of the F1.
With the exception of advertising, RTL is doing a better job with the four races it is still allowed to broadcast.
So anyway, the grandiose F1 season is a lot less fun than it would be with a decent broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
I submitted the contact form for returning an item yesterday, but have not received any email confirmation or the like.
My question would be, has my question been answered?
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Federal state now has highest coronavirus incidence
Thüringen has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, its value is above the mark of 1000.
On Sunday, Thuringia was the only federal state where the number of cases exceeded 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value at 1,025 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always had the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the number of cases in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but was still above 1000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new cases of infection with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths associated with an infection were reported within a day.
200 people seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there can be delays in reporting.
In addition, health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and can hardly keep up with the new cases.
Could you please send me any transaction number... or anything that could help?
Transfer confirmation... etc
It is time for change
Dear Bundestag, I greet you, I am /StratorDE in the heart of Europe in the Plenarsaal on a fantastic day!
Why the post here?
If you take a look at the activity of the last few months of the Bundestag, one thing is clear: it doesn't exist.
We've got into a winter rut and extended the summer drought for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what happened?
Most of it is probably just a reflection of the general unhappiness, some of the things that have happened and the way we have been performing.
In recent days, there has been a growing sense that many people here still really want to go to the federal conference.
What we must change
At this point, the community surrounding the Bundestag is asking what it wants to do with it.
The call came from u/edizVEVO, who recently became aware of the project and found a, shall we say, mountain of shards.
After some back-and-forth writing, several people from the community have found themselves interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to call on everyone again to participate, otherwise this project will not have a future.
To this end, we have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas and work on concrete things together.
You can sign up to the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the Bundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves to the world in future?
* How should new members be recruited?
How do we get a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot some things, but it's not the end of the world, we have Discord for that.
If you're up for it and have the time, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's democratically decide the future.
What you are describing is *awareness* - consciousness during general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
The most common experience is hearing noises/voices, less often seeing images, and the rarest is feeling pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with a higher rate of awareness since, in order to protect the child, very deep anesthesia is avoided until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Specific anesthesia procedures like total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex did not have it by definition.**
I misread her comment.
Why is the delivery not started until 16 March?
There was nothing on your website about such long delivery times
Chat connection is gone now?
I also have to work sometimes!
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the daytime cover #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
I had not restarted the e-#PRS_ORG# before purchasing it.
Should I do that now?
We had nothing to do with the chair.
All of a sudden, there it was
I just sat there
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I cannot see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cupboard will be removed promptly.
And I beg you, please make it happen now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will dismantle the wardrobe as far as possible for removal - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by telephone at any time to arrange a collection date.
Our little one has been sleeping on her front from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child holds much more than you think.
Make sure everything around it is right, no cuddly toys, go in more often and have a look but not minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
And we didn't have a sleeping bag, we always had a blanket.
Watch your child sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it stand up from the stomach?
Or is it face down, directly on the mattress?
That will give you a clue as to whether everything is okay.
We're all grown up now, and when my husband was born, it was a case of out of the frying pan and into the fire - putting kids on their tummies to sleep.
So I want to send the lamp back
How do I get there best?

There are injuries.
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and which still has not been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it would be sent Monday, the second Lady said she would look into it and never replied.
Where there is still Christmas ham in Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and presents.
Have you not yet got any chicken?
Time is running out now.
We will tell you where you can get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the loupe should be positioned as close as possible to the eye.
The lens system, which is especially apochromatic and achromatic, allows you to use the magnifier practically and error-free, right up to the edge of the field of view.
Often, loupes are marked with magnification specifications.
However, these figures apply only to precisely defined conditions that are rarely the same as the conditions of use.
In order to use your loupe to its fullest, we would like to draw your attention to the technical specifications in the table "Technical Data" (Please refer to the instructions manual in the packaging).
Light reflexes are created on the surfaces of all optical devices - even in impact lupes.
Antireflective coatings significantly reduce these reflections.
If the ideal usage conditions are met - the loupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the instructions that accompany the product (available in German and English).
Zeiss VisuCard magnifying card magnifier pocket magnifier reading magnifier reading aid

And its tough exterior makes it resistant to everyday wear and tear.
Each loupe comes with a cardboard sleeve for safe storage and transport.
They offer these parts, which you can see in the pictures or under "What do they offer?"
In what condition is the offered article?
Of course, everyone can forget something once in a while, because no human is free of errors - if this is the case, simply write a message and it will be fully clarified (either through exchange, partial refund or complete refund).
They get a proper bill.
It will be sent when not explicitly requested otherwise by the buyer, insured with tracking number via DHL!
The individual shipping costs are taken from the above shipping conditions.
There are no additional handling costs.
I have not received any message
Okay, then I have a sofa without using it.
Could you offer me a legacy or a voucher then?
What was more expensive?
Darmstadt second in table after first half of season - Pauli wins in Dusseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 are working their way out of the relegation zone.
Things are also not going well for Ingolstadt under their third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hanover about interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed start with the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
What happens now?
What about the books? How do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I get by
Fine.
We will not order anything there anymore.
When they add my and my friend #NAME#'s (same address) sales, they obviously have lost a good customer.
They are happy to pass this on to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Must the wardrobe be completely dismantled for removal and refund?
And when would the pickup be?
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund was initiated and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back.
Well, I can't do anything about the fact that the wardrobe is completely disturbed when it arrives with me
Please take a look at the screenshot to see what your colleague wrote
It is clear and unmistakable that the repayment was prompted and I still have not received any repayment via #PRS_ORG
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I cannot open the book.
I followed her recommendations and synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I am a little frustrated because the whole thing has taken up a lot of time and I am hoping for help now.
To fight fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin has not yet made a public statement about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend prompted him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against COVID-19.
There were false reports on social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," Sahin wrote on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
"For the past few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counteract these false rumours."
Until now, he has rejected this, because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 infection and has been attached to a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
However, "the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and distrust."
It is difficult to fight fear with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating online in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the German Welle itself clarified.
I am not allowed by law to get the vaccine myself at the moment, Şahin said at the time.
There is a priority for vaccination in Germany.
In the meantime, priority has long been lifted - and the biontech boss has had himself vaccinated three times, according to his own statements.
110 kV underground cable will be newly built in 2022
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's planning approval decision clears the way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the commune and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning near Reut to a pylon of the overhead line.
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would be grateful if you could arrange for the return to be sent at my expense.
I consider an 8-euro return fee to be unjustified.
The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Thanks to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a single board, we achieve dimensions of just 30mm x 15.5mm, and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive of the H0 and 0 gauges.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm "lollipop" speaker plus speaker kit.
Like all members of the family, the LokSound5 is a true multiprotocol decoder.
He is familiar with the DCC data format, just like Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are as self-evident as two- and four-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders connect to a suitable digital headquarters automatically.
He masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main track.
For centres that can only programme the CVs of 1 to 255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola users benefit from up to 28 elevator floors at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola® addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
An embedded programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration with mfx-compatible central systems.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognises Märklin® brake tracks as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brake building blocks or with constant voltage.
In addition, he also holds a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC-Pendelzugautomatik allows automatic travel between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC networks.
Travelling a lot and still well equipped?
With the Everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
The 20-liter tank holds even larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stowed using the padded FlexFold divider.
And anything else you need for daily use is organised in the individually configurable interior and easily separable from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The slick, minimalist design is, quite literally, spoken for - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the rucksack while still providing instant access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works in two ways: either conventionally via the flap lid, which can be secured with the MagLatch latching system - an excellent thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the Messenger bags.
In the closing flap there is a metal latch with a matching anchor bar on the front of the rucksack.
Unlike most rucksacks, Peak Design has provided for various "filling levels": there are four anchor plates, stiffly welded, into which the latch mechanism can be inserted.
If the rucksack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it's rather empty, a lower one.
Flaps and hooks are also magnetic.
This means that the rucksack can be closed reliably without having to fasten the buckle.
The second possibility, the Everyday Backpack, differs fundamentally from other photo backpacks: in addition to the flap, there is also a tear-off opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional rucksacks with access from above - you no longer have to rummage through the content!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the suitability of the rucksack for everyday use: If, in addition to your photo equipment, you also take everyday items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more about this below), and so easily separate both of them without any problems - and also access them independently via the two side openings.
You can also pull the rucksack from the right side over your body, for example to access the camera equipment in the right main pocket, while everyday essentials stay safely in the left rucksack pocket and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help.
And because the exterior of the rucksack is also made from 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents stay dry even if it's going to rain in Scotland in the autumn.
Hello, I just saw that they are sold out of #NAME.
That is very sad.
Is it still produced?
Or has it been completely taken off the shelves?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
Community worker contradicts constitution
Hallo r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So application to the municipality.
A member of staff writes to me that felling fruit trees is not covered by the byelaws.
The walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree in the constitution.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on expert opinions.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
Holetschek: Countries discuss the abolition of the obligation to take a test for people who have been vaccinated three times
The state health ministers want to decide on their next meeting about a nationwide end to the compulsory testing for triple vaccination.
We need clarity quickly as to whether and from when unvaccinated people can be exempted from the test, said Klaus Holetschek (CDU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to the "Bild am Sonntag".
The withdrawal of 2G plus for triple vaccination is "not only medically sensible, but also gives an additional boost to vaccination", said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will submit a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference next Tuesday". - afp
Shame, I got it as a present and it's too small :(

I did not receive it and therefore could not cash it, which is why I have finally asked.
Last year, because of Corona, I had totally different problems and no time for it.
And now it's over, which makes me very angry.
Looking at the chat, it was about the Asare sofa.
Hello #NAME#, is it possible to get a small sample of the wood beforehand?
It is to be supplemented with existing furniture, and so we can check in advance whether it matches the colour scheme
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event helped shape the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shiny nuggets in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and prosperous towns in the state.
Camps were designated, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels arose almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer, seeking wealth in the West and looking to make a name for yourself.
You'll be mining for gold, recruiting workers, herding horses, and building companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding waterways and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - it seems the other pioneers have the same idea!
You have to outperform your fellow pioneers to avoid going bust with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, must manage your resources and build a tableau which more and more "works" (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions or use rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays out over the course of three years, from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the right locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a block!
This deactivates half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, exploring rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning gunfighters.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the start of each round, the appraiser turns to a new location, thereby changing the available actions.
This goes on for so long that the advertiser has moved five times, so that each location has been covered once, and the year ends.
There's a shootout where players must defend Coloma from an attacking band of outlaws.
If the players have supplied enough gunmen and outnumber the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final ranking is determined.
The player with the most victory points wins!
With free shipping, I take up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm the shipping type, goods in transit (games enclosed).
Otherwise, mostly DPD insured and with package tracking (games included, wrapped in cellophane and packaging paper).
If you are a collector, I can send the cardboard in a cardboard envelope for an extra charge of 2 euros, which guarantees that it will not go to any printing plates.
In the name of the people: Lay people pass judgement
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the judge's bench.
But a lot hinges on her verdict, even if she is not wearing a robe: Jurors help judges decide whether and for how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them talk to "the public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznach district court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the John F. Kennedy Street court.
I would be happy, I had already ordered the same sofa in blue in November and also got it. Therefore, because they are so beautiful, I would now have one in grey.
Yes, what I don't understand is that the other basket has also been ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered it already in November.
Here: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
But that's how it is with others.
Can you then send the lamp back to me?
Because it's too low for a table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
Shame, I would have liked to have stayed with you, but if the voucher isn't credited to me, I won't be ordering again.
If you have a different opinion, please let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
During the lockdown, no tree nursery has opened...
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no presents yet.
The beautiful, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get in the festive mood by baking cookies with her son.
I love it, said Catterfeld.
But she has a few things to do before Christmas: "For the first time I don't have any presents to give, I have to finally buy some".
Thank you anyway!
Then I'll buy somewhere else when the money is back.
But will I get it back easily?
The chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros don't help either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation and standard in the eCommerce sector.
Please check if they can at least take away the broken chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose money there.
But just because he says it doesn't mean it's nothing.
It's like when an AfD politician says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit to it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some antisemitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it completely.
Yeah, wow, then you're just as unserious as Kollegah.
Anyone who fundamentally questions evolution is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a god started the whole thing.
But if you're a creationist, you have to believe the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just rubbish.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
But it comes much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
Thank you first of all for being here for the whole thing, I too spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar role, that is to say we were also gun bearers in the executive, I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplistically posed.
In principle one could say that the civil servant rather comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should actually be clear to everyone.
Of course everyone knows that people on the right in particular are drawn to the magic of the uniform and people with guns. And of course it is also clear that these people can hardly deal with the reality these people can hardly deal with the reality they live in, because you have to deal with the fact that alongside the average white person, you now have many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the overly feminine stereotypes, because there are hardly any of those in the executive, just normal men and women, who you don't notice are gay), and also these people I can rely on, because in the event of doubt they will save your life or put their own in danger for you.
But even these fringe groups, to my experience, represent a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel disadvantaged by overly left-wing policies, even if these policies are supposedly aimed at them and they feel they have to be compensated for. They just want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since of course the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will find extreme right there as well, but they are allowed to say their opinions there openly or even hatch any subversive plans, and that is completely over the top and makes me angry.
Of course, sometimes even police officers and soldiers on foreign missions begin to stereotype and say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing sympathizers meet and have lively discussions.
Nevertheless, something like that is well combated and counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined and that is a good thing, in my opinion, that we could not afford to have right-wing racists and Nazis in our ranks!
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I/Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60-euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG night table and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
The package wants to bring #PRS_ORG today.
Please contact me

Hello - I am interested in the Boone dining table, white.
Is it also available in large 230cm?
And the wardrobe?
Will we get another update on the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
I would like the #PRS_ORG to be delivered to my room.
How do I book that?
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then become relevant in law.
I'm taking a screenshot.
When do you sign up?
If delivery is not possible in my apartment, I must cancel the order!
IEs is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I already received an email on 18 January stating that the refund had been processed.
But to date the money has not come into my account.
Could you please check that.
In addition, we are already "regular customers" there and have already bought a lot of articles
But why are you only offering me 20 euros?
No, not until I press enter comes a field with the message
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello lovely girls and women,
I've got a few things I want to write about and maybe it will help the one - or others too...
I'm 24, I have PTSD, a full-time student and a dog mum - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to nursery, he is actually 1:1 my child.
My boyfriend (since 6th grade) is sick, he got second-degree burns on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I went to visit him because I have emotional needs as well, and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him wash up (because his hand was in a cast due to burns).
On top of that, he's cold and we're currently seeing each other less (1-2 times a week), which is causing me a lot of trouble with regard to my needs for affection and love.
My dog is suffering from stomach ache, I have cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has calmed down a bit after I warmed the lamp and stroked him.
I live with my sister and my mother, and she's away for a month.
Now we also have household chores to do, which we will of course share between us.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS is under control just now, I'm half-way through my therapy, and I've learned to deal with it.
Not great, but I get by and am almost symptom-free.
My uni is asking for a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test that I haven't done anything for and tomorrow afternoon anatomy lesson that I should at least prepare a bit for.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and then what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no room for it there.
So my week goes: Just until tomorrow morning, then it's the weekend.
But then, does it all just go on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I just think I'm so stressed at the moment that I need these mental cues because otherwise I'll just pack it in.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same?
I'm endlessly grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly speechless with gratitude.
I don't know whether I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think that has a lot to do with the mental load that women carry, and that's why I thought that I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all an enjoyable evening, the week is almost over!
Due to Omikron: Johnson wants to promote booster vaccination
New Omikron cases keep politicians and scientists busy in the UK.
As a result, all adults in England who wish to be vaccinated should receive an offer by New Year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to speed up the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine in the face of rapidly rising Omega numbers.
Every adult in England should already have had the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since their second dose, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to the nation on Sunday evening.
Until now, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will also provide additional support so that the vaccination campaigns can be accelerated in the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish regions.
In light of the Omikron variant, we are facing a state of emergency, so vaccination protection must be stepped up immediately, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be raised again with a third vaccination.
Johnson said, "Let's boost now!"
On Sunday, 1,239 more cases of the Omicron variant were recorded in Britain, taking the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, that was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

The decorative light fits harmoniously into every bed, garden area or stone garden.
The light is simply mounted and can be anchored in the ground with two spikes.

In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: it is the sun alone that makes this solar lamp fascinating – in white or coloured light (in six different colour tones).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberate: This modern light object presents itself as a naturally formed large pebble during the day.
Its organic curves fit in seamlessly with any natural environment – whether on the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where his size enables him to hold his own.
You can save a lot of work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires neither a power supply nor batteries.
Set the "glow stone" on any sunlit place.
Two spades provided ensure firm footing if required.
The matt-white plastic casing itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides the "Smart Stone" discreetly in its interior, together with his battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for coloured light.
The battery charges when sunlight falls on the casing.
As twilight falls, "Smart Stone" begins to glow of its own accord; you can choose the colour yourself: there are six attractive light colours to choose from, in addition to daylight white.
Even the switching off is done automatically as soon as the battery charge drops to a predetermined minimum or it gets light again.
As soon as the sun comes out, the charging cycle begins again the next day.
Okay, then.
I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS_ORG collection in June.

NEKTON Bio supports a smooth operation of the Mauser and feather regeneration.
NEKTON Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy coat.
The majority of feather damages occurring in avian husbandry are attributable exclusively to dietary errors.
Since the feathers are made of protein, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect feather coat.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Much of the animal loss that occurs during the moulting period is due to inadequate or imbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate vitamin and mineral supplementation.
In the composition of NEKTON Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant foods is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
While NEKTON Bio is being used, no other vitamin preparation should be given.
NEKTON Bio is soluble in cold water and can simply be added to drinking water or animal feed.

Trade is worried about Christmas business because of the 2G ruling.
Only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed into most shops.
The trade considers this to be unnecessary and complains about a drop in turnover.
He also has a possible solution at hand.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are depriving retailers of the important Christmas business.
Stefan Genth, managing director of HDE, criticised a fall in profits at businesses that sell non-daily items.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked at the remaining days of the year negatively.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit, said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions therefore lost almost a third of their pre-crisis turnover in the past week.
It is only going well in the food and grocery sector as well as online.
The association called for consequences to be drawn from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
2G while shopping will not help us in the fight against the pandemic, he stressed.
The current regulations scared customers off and required a high level of personnel.
The band rule must be permitted nationwide, he demanded.
Afterwards, each customer would only have to be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access that day to all shops with the band received.
In addition, spot checks should be sufficient in retail - as is already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The property company Deutsche EuroShop, which specialises in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Frequencies were last without 2G at around 75 percent of the pre-corona level, with sales at around 90 percent.
These figures will now fall in the middle of the crucial Christmas business," said Chief Executive Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personal and administrative expense, efforts will be made to find solutions and get approval for the centers.
This also includes the so-called wristband solution, with "visitors, for example, having to present their 2G voucher at a central point in the centre and then, equipped with a wristband like in a club hotel, be able to enter all the shops without any problems." dpa

House fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in an apartment building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, a valuable damage in the six-digit euro range has occurred, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport onto the adjacent house in Kinsau (in the rural district of Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reportedly taken to hospital with mild smoke poisoning on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not rule out arson.
The Criminal Investigation Department of Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.

“Arcane” on Netflix: What is the series good for “League of Legends”?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, an awe-inspiring presentation: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently started streaming on Netflix.
Why are we excited about the already announced two seasons?
First on the #PRS_ORG.
This has been the case for about.
14 days no more.
This is why I have always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG.
After the launch of our new high-end headphones, the B 100 6 Ohm, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get some new blood.
SOLO 15 is the new offshoot and is reminiscent of the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM in terms of its design.
However, a suitably designed foot is included in this construction proposal to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can be adapted accordingly to the conditions at home.
Principally, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people, for whom the maximum sound level plays only a subordinate role in terms of sound quality, but an exceptionally high level should be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker simply isn't able to generate sound pressure levels that are close to unfiltered.
However, that does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it steps up impressively mature and strikingly accurate for its size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned to a slightly higher treble.
This is generally the case with broadband to optimize the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is precisely aimed at the listening position and convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
The high tones can be slightly turned outwards and thus the sound can be warmed up.
Thanks to the point source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is extremely sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference-suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM create an enemy dynamic that seeks its equal.
The SOLO 15 is not only an addition to our SOLO series, but extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our builds, it's recommended to think about the final aesthetic of the speaker at the beginning, in order to incorporate any necessary changes into the build.
If you want to veneer the housing, for example, the lowering of the speaker must be adapted accordingly, as the veneer adds additional material.
After all the plates had been cut (e.g. in the DIY store), a 8 mm hole should be drilled in the floor panel at the appropriate point, so that the cable could be led through there without any problems later.
With the help of a jig, the speaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase to design the opening area of the speaker chassis as large as possible.
The four fixing points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
After that, you begin to build the box itself, placing one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
These are now glued to the back, lid, front and floor.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued in.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if required, such as using pre-cut strips from the timber store rather than cutting your own from 16mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be attached.
Then come all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides and the front.
Using a matching hole saw or Forstner bit makes installing the bass reflex port openings, as well as the connection clip on the back wall, easier.
Finally, a round router is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the foot plate can also be rounded off with it.
Next, the footplate is glued firmly to the bottom of the housing and additionally screwed in with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) the fixing points of the speaker chassis and the connection clip.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (absorb / blow off), you can begin laying the cable.
This is easiest to achieve by the 35 mm bass reflex port in the rear wall.
To do this, the entire and uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm drill hole in the foot until it reaches the terminal opening, and is left hanging there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and is also left hanging there.
The frequency changer is then prepared and used.
The construction plan for the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be obtained from the following document: Installation instructions Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency switch is fitted and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box is next, which is not yet completely closed.
Thanks to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening, and with a bit of skill, you can drizzle hot glue onto the opening and seal it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small torch, you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now comes the muffling, according to the description.
Next, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and tightened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus lead (marked cable) must be connected to the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
At the end, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
To dampen this, a mat of damping material is cut in two and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex port should be kept free.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Did you also order the legs in white?
Police shoot dead suspected bank robbers near the royal palace
A gunman has been shot dead by police near London's Kensington Palace on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man who had gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a gun.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Hello, I have a question about your #PRS_ORG series
These products are advertised with additional purchasing hooks, which we cannot find with you.
Can they help?

Today it costs 179€.
I find that quite annoying.
Must I cancel my order and place a new one for the better price, or is there another way to credit my account?
Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: Women search for Christmas trees in the community of Krembz
Frank Diers, a farmer, has already witnessed many curious situations when selling Christmas trees.
Once, a man drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree on anything.
He plants 2000 of them every year.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many curious situations.
He says that the pre-Christmas period always brings a bit of fun.
Always like out of an egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He manages to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
At the moment he is out on the road with the "Good Day, Dear Luck" programme - if he is even allowed to appear.
Max Raabe actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 "on the instructions of the authorities" to contain the spread of the Corona virus.
His other performances planned for Advent must also be cancelled for the time being, as it says on the website of the singer, who is 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists then want to catch up on their dates from 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang as a young man a lot and with pleasure.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place in the charts - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das keine Problem" (2013).
He has made it from the niche into the mainstream.
Dressed impeccably, with his blond hair slicked back and on-trend, Max Raabe is unmistakable in the current German-speaking music scene.
Since 2020, he has been touring with the "Good morning, dear happiness" programme. dpa
How do you respond to the question of why you're vegan?
Today I had a chat with a colleague I like.
She herself lived as a vegetarian for a while, and doesn't eat meat that often at the moment.
I myself was a vegetarian for several years before that.
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism been a planned stepping stone, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that by being a vegetarian I would be supporting the animal's wellbeing, but eventually came to realise and understand that I was in fact supporting animal cruelty.
So my decision to go vegan.
In that moment I got the impression that on their side there was displeasure, they defended vegetarianism then and said they knew where their meat came from and how to reduce animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I'm wondering if my answer was too "plump"?
How do they answer the question?
I get the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise that you would not have otherwise.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;

Content warning: I will be writing a bit more detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something from the heart.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A theme that really hits home with me and is unfortunately all too common is that many victims do not want to or think they cannot be helped.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and that it will not be perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even when talking face-to-face, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I want to make clear to everyone, is that I am very close to tears myself, and that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to simply put up with violence.
I often wish I could help more... I know I can't.
But it will never get any easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so invaluable.
Treatment for fertility problems with PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for a while, now suddenly it's a problem with the PKV.
One after the other:
We applied for the children's wish in the run-up to the PKV and got the promise of 3 tests.
The experiments were in no way restricted (e.g. by time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
A few months later we tried for a second child and had 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count these towards the PKV.
We again applied for the costs to be covered by the PKV and were again granted 3 further tests.
After a few more attempts (we carried out more trials than agreed, logically the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2 + 3), the PKV is only going to reimburse 3 trials.
The justification: The pregnancy/birth makes the other two tests of the first commitment redundant.
The second pregnancy is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "The insurance case begins with the start of medical treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
Questions to the experts in the round here:
Who is right here, the PKV (only three attempts are reimbursed) or us (there are five attempts to be reimbursed)?
Did the PKV have to point out to us in the promises that the further experiments would be cancelled with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Half victory against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to the political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in a sustainable way, the researcher at the Berlin SWP foundation explained.
This state of suspension - Belarus is not giving much, but the EU feels it is a winner - is likely to go on for a while longer.
The treatment of people on the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
There seems to be a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by some EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not opposed this, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion in the Union.
If a member state is determined to do its own thing, it is apparently impossible for the Commission to stop it, as is currently the case with Poland, which has even refused access to its borders to the EU's border control agency, Frontex.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, says Bossong: An agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult as the line "Border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
New attempt to cross the border
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have once again attempted to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested and brought back to the border overnight on Sunday, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
Polish officials were reportedly pelted with stones by migrants near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border police registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening a group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border fences.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukaschenko of being the ruler in Minsk, having lured it with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that carry migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent their departure.
The most effective element of the EU reaction is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
Here, the EU has thrown its weight as a market player onto the scales and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take account of internal political costs.
The Belarusian authorities are probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly herd thousands of people through the country.
That's good, thanks.
I am expecting a response by early next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Fire in power substation: tens of thousands of people without power
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating either.
A fire had disabled an electricity substation.
After a fire with severe damage to an electrical substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia were without power for around 24 hours.
The fire caused the lights to go out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
Energy supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power units had been in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely remedied late in the evening.
Firefighters and volunteers and volunteers of the THW provided assistance in the communities.
Authorities offered support at schools and appealed for help from the neighborhood.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are well aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless work, said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repairs will still take a few days as the Westnetz engineers were only able to put some lines back into service provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect caused the fire.
Electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire which broke out on Friday at around 19:15, heavily damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the substation at Neunkirchen-Seelscheid.
There, expensive cleaning and repair works are necessary.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt level was created.
Thanks to this bypass, the power supply is back up and running.
Since 6 p.m. on Saturday, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 9.30pm.
Since 9.15 p.m. power has also been restored to those last affected by the outage.
Over 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
After setting up emergency power supplies for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also appealed for help from the neighbourhood.
It is important now that citizens look out for their elderly or lonely neighbours in their neighbourhood and inform the local fire department if help is needed, explained district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power supplies, the residents of old people's homes were a priority.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places in schools were set up for those people who were unable to look after themselves or who needed electrically powered medical equipment or were dependent on medical care.
Nordic Combined: Combined skier Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
Having to give up again was the duo, this time to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had started with a big lead after the ski jump.
I took the lamp apart again.
And back together again.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
I would still like to send them back
If you can let me have the receipt, I can package the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG.
Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is like a rollercoaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, this success is first and foremost the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers cares for their appearance.
After all, Aniston says, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, really: one single chip out of the bag).
It is in fact a wonder that they manage to appeal to both male and female fans.
Maybe because she's just unlucky in love - and still searching for the big one.
And crossed off the baby wish list.
Previously, she was constantly being asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
People ask me that and have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It is to be hoped that success and fame will also make one happy.
Someone who works or studies in biochemistry
I am currently in my first semester studying biochemistry and I find the subject quite exciting and I am not bothered by it in the lab (I have already done my organic chemistry practical).
Of course, I also looked into the job prospects before starting my studies, but at the time I still thought that I would definitely carry on studying until my doctorate.
But right now I have doubts, especially about the job prospects.
On the one side (Studycheck etc) one keeps hearing about amazing career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other side one keeps hearing about unemployed biologists and incredibly badly paid jobs.
Therefore, I would really be interested:
1) What are you working on at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/ What training did you do?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really unsure and am considering not continuing my studies in 2022 and becoming an IT specialist instead.
If you have any experience in this field, please write about it!
I had returned the contact form or given up on it and wanted to inquire whether it had arrived or not, as I have not yet received any confirmation.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG on 12/12/19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front of the seat).
I am asking for help.
We are selling all Smeg kitchen appliances and accessories in our online shop kitchenpoint.de.

Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will be holding the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, due to well-known reasons, we are not able to get more than four people in the studio, which means more planning and the reason for the short notice of the announcement.

It is still about my order that is no longer deliverable.
I chatted with #NAME# beforehand.
Alternatively, the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros could still be delivered to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only you as a partner company.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
The title is available, I am a vaccinating doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered in care homes.
As these are soon to be completed to a large extent, it will then go to a vaccination centre for me.
I'm happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organisational and human aspects, and medical questions, provided they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, will that interact with the vaccine...").
In my area of responsibility is the information about the vaccination, the indication (person has a right to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination decree and no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me before).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we rarely have a doctor there, but rather "only" (please God!) pharmaceutical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, who, however, cannot carry out injections (can they?), so that I also carried out most of the vaccinations myself there.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in part so far.
The blue betting slip #PRS_ORG# with the reference #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the comment "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the further procedure is now?
A great start to the week!
I bought it directly with my #PRS_ORG, it seems to be on it.
If I open it, the message comes, ups!
This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty - please report this to our customer service.
As far as I can tell, it's a #PRS_ORG# ePub file.
Can you help me any further?

There are various types of palettes.
One of the most common is the Euro pallet, a standardised wooden pallet that is mainly used as a load carrier in the European area.
They are certified by the European pallet association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million palettes were produced in Austria in 2020.
The value of production was around €79 million.
The number of palettes imported to Austria annually is not recorded
Taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the wrong goods.
Do I get this by email?
For all three packages?
Because the lamp came to me in three separate packages
At least 100 killed in tornadoes in Kentucky
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes moved through the USA.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be lamented.
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
In the night from Friday to Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and may have claimed up to a hundred fatalities.
The storms left a roughly 320-kilometer-long trail of destruction, mainly in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster zone that everything had been swept away everywhere the tornado had passed.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Industrial facilities and roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects as many as 100 deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with the official numbers rising hourly.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG from the order #NUMBER.
I have actually already decided on a new one with #PRS_ORG but I would really like to do the return journey as quickly as possible.
Can it not be changed or not? Write in English, I also understand that.
That's been a long time, then I'd give up
Filmsuche Hilfe bitte
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for teenagers.
There are two time axes (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely certain).
As I cannot describe it more closely in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the land of the dead, a young soldier (in uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman there so he can live too, I think.
I think the transition is also the soldier's grave.
In the end, I think both soldiers will fight each other.
If that's something you want to know, I'm grateful for every answer.
Obviously, the chair had an invisible defect when sold.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Oh, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that could take time.
What steps should I take now?
I would like to return it and then order it again as it is currently on offer.
We understand that.
Then we'll use the new packaging for them.
The party we wanted to throw away: Frankfurt celebrates a goal-filled comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, Hesse, who had not won for the last two games in a row, were supposedly on their way to their next Bundesliga collapse.
But then the SGE turned it around, shot the frustration of a mediocre season start from their soul within one hour and won furiously with 5:2. It is insane what the boys have achieved today, cheered trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and issued a "general compliment for everyone who was there".
It initially looked as if it would be another dampener for the Frankfurt team, which is still ranked ninth, but behind expectations.
Patrik Schick had brought Leverkusen into the lead with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
How the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance, continued Glasner.
I am so happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday of the season and his muscle injury, stressed his teammates' morale.
I think our mentality is incredible, said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result in particular for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the coming tasks, however, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also sees himself well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It's unusual to have all the players fit in December and all the players in top physical condition.
It is top-level work in our medical department, but the players also live a professional life.
Now one wants to "go step by step and stay modest" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next up is an away game on Wednesday as part of the English week at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6.30pm, Sky).
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously been developed, which has led to the combination of the advanced modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X, VT40X and VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand-new modeling engine that is absolutely state of the art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Naturally, these amps also contain the three-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analogue circuits because they get the sound variations and nuances of a valve amplifier much better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated switching system, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed casing and a bass reflex system through which the natural resonances bubble up naturally.
With VOX's Tone Room software, you can even go in and correct and tweak historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound like you've always imagined they would.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modelling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then in order to meet the latest sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed for guitarists looking for maximum sound variety.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that it is the final stage that determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, fitted with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behaviour, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
Problems with glass fibre + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fibre optic connection in the house for a couple of weeks.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems setting up a stable WiFi network.
Before that I had a 50Mbit DSL connection and used Devolo DLan, which has been reliable apart from a couple of outages and has delivered 50Mbit downloads and uploads.
The new fibre optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receives these.
However, the other DLan module, which transmits Wi-Fi, no longer transmits the full 500, but the less I move around the house with the module, the less there is (so use a power socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the internet, using the new fibre optic connection, is now slower on the first floor than it was before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similar losses here.
Could someone please explain why so much internet speed is lost when using fibre optics through the power cable?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay new LAN cables in that house.
I am really at my wit's end, which is why I have created an extra account here.
Therefore, I would be all the more pleased about an answer.
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already completely furnished two apartments with your furniture.
Wanted to get the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now reliable?
Many thanks
With friendly greetings
If there's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll try again soon, because it simply doesn't work here.
Hello.
Today my #PRS_ORG came, but I cannot squeeze it together and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send them back as they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a response
Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20 KQ and about 3 years old) would no longer be charged by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the battery alone was enough to run it.
Low battery, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start despite being plugged in.
I then expanded the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in online mode?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
Yes, we both started from scratch and use version 4.5...
It could be the case that they have already heard of the problem more often
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new homes
New Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as has been demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With expropriation, no new homes are created, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the years ahead.
A mixture of private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is actually the best protection against monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and the Left will set up an expert committee on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
But if the situation does not improve, Geywitz has recently been talking to the FDP in the coalition of the Ampel party about further tightening up of the rental laws.
The coalition treaty provides for a rent brake until 2029, a restriction of rent increases in tight housing markets and an expansion of the rental spectrum.
I will speak to the Attorney General to see how quickly that can be implemented.
If the rental market does not ease off despite that, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not €1,699 as originally planned?
Advice and ideas for further career life
Happy Christmas to you!
My Christmas is a bit disappointing because my lovely head is just going over everything it can think of.
Before I start ranting here now ... in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so you.
I'm just starting out as a cross-over.
Originally I had studied something else and worked in an area there (so that I at least stay anonymous, I don't want to mention anything more specific).
But then it all became too boring and I started looking for alternatives that would be more fun.
At some point I landed a job as a teacher and I was sure that's what I wanted to do - even if the working conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I'm now on my third "I Google other job postings."
And it's only been half a year.
In the past, I have always decided to keep going and finish at least the ref, and then I can always change my mind.
But I am absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month, I am completely drained.
Now there are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the red card I always thought I was stress resistant, but this weekend was my weekend and my evening my evening.
There I was free.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures, which add to my nervousness.
In principle it's fun and when you look at it from the outside it's going well, which is the feedback and so on.
But I am completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can take before it shuts down completely - if it hasn't already.
I ask myself whether I want to have this for the rest of my working life - just when I read some of your contributions - or whether I should not rather go back to the old area, where I was valued, I was allowed to take my free time if I needed it, and the work was boring, but I was paid appropriately and I worked as part of a team and not as a lone fighter, as is now the case most of the time.
But then I ask myself whether I would not be in the same place in a year's time, as I am now, and dissatisfied.
You know, it's all a bit weird, but perhaps outsiders can have advice or ideas of how to get out of this situation, which I have completely finished and which I am basically crying at the thought of starting.
I am not going to make any decisions now, which is probably not a good thing.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for the time being.
Thank you for reading, and sorry for the whiny undertone of me.
I hope that my situation is at least a little clearer now.
Theaterhistoriker Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has profiled himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
He later wrote a monumental theatrical history.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, fresh off the press: "An Old Man Grows Older".
The diary of a slow departure from the world, written by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading, the news arrives that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I'm already thanking my life here."
Yes, but it was said before.
They can't deliver from England because of #PRS_ORG.
He has moved to a new company over which he has glowered.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drink tea.
It has been a year.
He has obviously not welded himself to his old spot and has been looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you much back then: whatever.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables there.
Help with first own campaign
Boron is amazing!
I'm currently leading the adventure Over the Greifenpass for a group of 4 friends, and I want to seamlessly integrate my heroes into a custom-written campaign for players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual books outlined and now I'm writing the opening adventure and stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to take a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
The further action is to take place there.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is said to lie in wait for the heroes, luring them into an ambush.
I want the player characters to have the opportunity to deal with the confrontation in various ways: persuade, act, threaten, detect the danger early on, whatever comes to the players' minds.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords
The goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a hollow way, armed with three bows left and right, while two of them stop the wagon with spears.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and subsequently by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-wit.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. If defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf with two of his men attacks and helps the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is super.
How appropriate is your Deus ex Machina from solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an adventure starter?
The Goblins group will later play a decisive role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I did not expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee that many of your ideas will be implemented, and I now also have more confidence in my narratives.
You can forget that, I already explained that yesterday several times!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the whole side has collapsed, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is wrecked
The chest of drawers is in my home and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come in because of the #PRS_ORG# rules
This means that the wardrobe cannot be removed because nobody is allowed in my home

Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in the two-man bob - Sport
The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen, with 94 successes, is the target of the bobsleigh pilot.
I did the maths once, I would have to get nine and a half wins a season, then I might make it to Cortina 2026, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the Winterberg races.
Only on Saturday did he defend himself against the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, moving up from third to first.
Then, on Sunday, he changed something in his setup and finished 0.30 seconds ahead.
Together with his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Baur (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he defeated the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded, said Friedrich, who also scored his 22nd victory in a row.
Berchtesgaden's Johannes Lochner, who was travelling to Stuttgart, came second this time and reached fifth place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after coming fourth in the first race.
If I knew what he did instead, I would do the same, said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third home victory this season in the two-woman bob.
After coming fourth the day before in the monobob, she raced to victory on Sunday at the German triple success with push athlete Deborah Levi to the World Cup victory.
Two-woman bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thüringen came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she scored her first podium this winter.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki came third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool to get the first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is coming with me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and stressed: "It is not just pushing ahead, but there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little irritated by not quite flawless runs, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
When it's time to change your current account
Anyone who thought that calm would return to people's Giro accounts now will be disappointed.
While many banks used the autumn to confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are also falling.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now it has halved the free allowance and even quartered the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Postbank subsidiary - to EUR 50,000 for current accounts and investment accounts, and EUR 25,000 for day-to-day accounts.
However, these lower guarantees now apply to the entire German Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already lowered its limit to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has cut its bonus rates in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
Nevertheless: More than 100 banks now have a limit of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda Bank Berlin also came to 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute running there with the Consumers' Center which, in the first instance, had even been successful against this ruling at the Berlin Regional Court.
Now discussions are taking place in the banks as to whether the institutions should perhaps set aside reserves - in the event that the upper courts should deem the negative interest rates to be unlawful in principle and many millions will have to be repaid to bank customers.

Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula One finish in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has appealed.
The silver arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is linked to an alleged breach of regulations by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken irregularly.
A second appeal was lodged against the final classification.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in line with regulations.
Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and celebrated his first Formula 1 title.
The move came shortly after the end of a safety car phase during which the Dutchman overtook a car in front of him.

Damper for handball women before quarter final against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slunk off the court with hanging heads and empty gazes after their humiliation at the hands of Denmark.
At the end of the World Championship round of 16, the DHB selection team suffered a heavy defeat at 16-32 (8-13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face the hosts Spain in the quarter finals.
We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent, judged national coach Henk Groener.
We have to approach Spain differently.
After their first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8-2 points in second place behind the Danes (10-0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game by all of us that we need to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle for a place in the semi-final, there has to be a clear improvement against the 2019 World Champion on Tuesday, in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German scorer in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defence, said back player Xenia Smits and added: We have to look ahead quickly now.
From front to back not quite right
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on top at the start.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and holes in the defence were responsible for the quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at match temperature and prevented worse with a few parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a fast counterattack.
However, the hoped-for initial spark was not this.
The German women could hardly put up a fight against the aggressive Danish defense - and when they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian team.
The game was over at 3-10 after 20 minutes, which was early, especially as back player Mia Zschocke later saw a red card for a hard foul on the opposing player.
She is allowed to participate again in the quarter final.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB team started to play a bit better and until the break at least managed to get the score to five goals.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone already after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Greens' proteges sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal candidates for the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer improve their performance and went off the court as a clear loser.
