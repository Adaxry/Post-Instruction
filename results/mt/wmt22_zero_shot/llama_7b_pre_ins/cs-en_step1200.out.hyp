The big return of Czech smokers is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a tough period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 13-year-old native of Plzeň will be on the bench and will soon be able to get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň or Russian Chelyabinsk injured himself in the preparation for the NHL in October last year.
Exactly halfway through the game against Vegas, he was replaced and has not played in the NHL since.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from post to post.
Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury, the Denver club announced early October.
His return to the net in the NHL ultimately stretched to more than two months.
On Sunday afternoon US time, he was called up from the farm where he had caught four ducks and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he had a 94.5% success rate.
The Pilsen native wants to finally make his mark and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
Last season he had problems with his ankles and did not play a single game in the shortened pandemic season.
In the NHL, "Francouz" played 36 games, his save percentage is 92.3%.
Charles puts Camilla in a Santa hat, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as their Christmas wish.
Prince Charles also shared his wish, using a photo of his wife Camilla helping their daughter-in-law Eugenie to put on her veil.
The British news agency BBC informed about it on its website.
Wishes are sent to friends, colleagues, and benefactors with whom they work.
Photography was created somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color and princess Charlotte also has dresses.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing the same shorts and polo shirt as Princes George and Louis.
Who took the photograph, William and Kate did not say, and it is not even clear when it was taken.
The royal family posed for photographs on a hay bale in front of a pile of wood at their country home in Norfolk for a Christmas card photo shoot.
The photo, which serves as a Christmas greeting, was also published by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured the moment in June at Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a veil on his face, helps Camille put on her veil, which matches her light-colored dress.
Slavia according to efotbal.cz promised Berbrovi million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Criminalists working on the current corruption case allegedly worked under the assumption that the former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, had been promised a million crowns by Prague Slavia for the 2018/19 league title.
The server efotbal.cz informed that he got access to some police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the red and whites did not engage in any corrupt practices.
The server published transcripts of police wiretaps, in which Slavia figures mainly as its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who was fired from the club in the summer.
According to the record, the former influential functionary of the red and white party was in frequent contact both with Berber and with the former sports director of then second league Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminalists are said to have worked on the assumption that Slavia Prague had promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the team SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police organ had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-crown bribe from the officials of SK Slavia Prague for winning the league, the server wrote in its verdict.
Later that day, according to criminalists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with Slavia president Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is not possible to determine whether the police are still working with this information.
Tvrdík denied any corrupt practices.
In 2015 to 2017 we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in any unlawful conduct, we were not trying to influence the judges against the rules of fair play, and we did not provide any financial compensation to anyone in this regard," said Tvrdik for Seznam Zprávy.
In addition to this, Nezmar unjustly insults some former Slavia players with dark skin and also denigrates his former boss Tvrdík.
The alleged interference in matches through match officials triggered the police intervention in mid-October at several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR.
The highest-ranking person involved in the scandal is Berbr, who no longer features in any football role.
In mid-January, the same as the former sports director of Vyšehrad Rogoz, he was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and BVP are role-playing the Cold War.
The guns will be new, but of a fundamentally worse type (artillerymen must work from a armoured cab and carry ammunition manually without protection).
Cars - Toyota Hi-Lux - are new and good
Pallets and various armoured vehicles - at a decent level, and the Prague V3S was also removed from special forces.
Aircraft: combat-capable, but old, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and of little combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we produce and export them)
PVO: medium - Cold War, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
Honitbu is right next to the city.
Nutria were swimming in the river and causing damage to crops, so I was sitting there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other bank of the river.
I didn't want to run a brothel, so I sat back and chilled out and he probably didn't even notice.
I hoped it would go away before something came out, but of course the cat had other ideas.
I let her get to 40 metres before deciding to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost capsized, he was looking around with his head on all sides, so I called him and said it was a fox.
Before I got off the bus I was fucked.
In other words, a man's lawn is his castle.
On the other hand, it's not war - it would have to be a coincidence of a lot of things to happen for something to happen, probably you would have seen it on thermal imaging which pretty much everyone has these days.
So, put the valuable things in the trunk and have peace of mind.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Internal respirators are significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, which is responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks and respirators closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns in recent weeks on their acquisition.
The iRozhlas server compared purchases made by individual ministries and found that during one day the amounts spent on respirators varied by several hundred crowns.
Why were prices changing so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
Why did others buy railway shares?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to iRozhlas editor Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (perhaps I am not affected by memories of the CSLA, which have affected older generations), but the CR cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't have big stocks of technology, which could be used for training, we don't have modern technology for existing professionals, modern technology is always more complicated, so the skills of reserves will be rapidly lost in time.
Modern conventional conflicts, to which everyone can apply, will be over very quickly, and no one will have time to train anyone again.
In the end, reserves/territorial defence are of great importance for countries such as Ukraine, where it is necessary to lead a mass guerrilla war and it is an express necessity to frighten the enemy.
Fighting will only be possible in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not have a suitable geography for that.
mainly we don't have individual skills.
It's not even the worst.
The worst is that half of them play as if they had it.
And then such a situation arises when you're looking like a fool, because you don't manage to get the ball into the empty goal for two minutes, and you ride out to the attack with two or even three attackers, and you say to yourself, "What, and what do you think is going to happen now?"
Of course they don't treat him like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this tackle is so bad that I am shocked that I am not seeing the referee penalise the defender for 'fouling the attacker'.
First butterflies
The Covid-19 pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major turning point in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the surge in hospitals will last for some time and the pandemic equation has a new unknown: the variant Omicron, which is likely to spread faster than the Delta variant currently prevailing.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course of the disease, how effective vaccination is against it, or how much post-infectious immunity is obtained from previous exposure to the disease.
But this week the Covid equation has also seen an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side: the possibility of a cure.
A new drug, antiviral molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalisation by a third, has arrived in the Czech Republic.
It should also be supplemented by the drug Paxlovid from the Pfizer company, which reports the success rate of even 85 percent from the previous results.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming drugs.
As was said, the first will be molnupiravir from Merck for Czech patients.
The company was the first to finish the trial because the drug had been in development for a long time before the current pandemic, with the aim of finding an appropriate treatment for equine viral disease on the South American continent.
This research often overlooks the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
Generally, they are less open and less willing to share their views.
Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to saying "as if our beaks have grown".
Look at the research, where people are asked if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they don't.
In the West, they'll tell you how much they like immigration, how everyone should help and how the Czechs are all racists.
And then they go and vote for the AfD.
There is a fear of cancel culture, telling this to the public means losing your job and being media lynched.
So in the polls it looks heavy, west good, east bad.
But he does find out what people really think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour, both have over 20%.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
Identical for the sake of filming units so the soldiers don't have to learn again where everything is, so all the objects are the same.
One is the Atom Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
Sranda is that Serbia did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security reasons or for faster deployment of warheads due to their western orientation.
Only the heads were kept in those underground silos (there are two in every chestnut tree).
If it was necessary to use this weapon, a special unit was sent, which picked up this head and mounted it on some kind of carrier.
In addition to the museum's horse chestnut, the rest are in a deplorable state.
At the second grade of the primary school we had a classmate Cigána, we were together for 4 years.
He was totally at ease, did great impressions, often went a bit too far, but he was such a great mascot.
Everyone knew him, he often went there, wanted to explain something, was rarely late, went there regularly, devoted himself to sports with us, did not steal snacks, nor phones, went there dressed properly.
He cycled to school in the countryside, did all sorts of odd jobs, but was always at ease, perhaps never suffering any embarrassment.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, who are Roma, started in the same class, different grades.
Shortly afterwards, the teacher was attacked, police were frequently called, students were threatened and intimidated there.
I occasionally sell something on Gumtree (old stuff, something I don't need etc.) and have sold to the Roma community before - they always had the money, never tried to rip me off, were polite.
I even sold the car that way, the boy called me up after a month and said he had changed his mind.
I myself say that I am not a racist - it's one thing if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or whatever, as long as they behave as they should in polite company (work, function, don't beat your wife, just basic stuff).
But when someone comes and grabs a hand, evacuates flats and houses, there's only chaos around, they're making problems... so one way or another, it doesn't matter what color it is, but I won't like it.
I have no problem with African migrants as long as they get involved, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, but at least English), respect our culture.
If you believe in Allah, it's one thing, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll respect theirs.
Young woman dies in car crash on Prachatice
A young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and despite resuscitation efforts, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries at the scene, said Právo spokeswoman for the South Bohemian Health Rescue Service Zuzana Fajtlova.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who picked up the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot car was probably travelling from the village of Žíchovec towards the village of Bavorov and for as yet undetermined reasons drove in the opposite direction in a bend.
After the collision, the Peugeot Octavia ended up on the roof, outside the lane of traffic, said spokeswoman for the South Bohemian police, Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
It was multiple injuries and he was trapped in the car.
After he was freed he was provided with emergency pre-hospital care and transported to the Czech Budějovice hospital by air in a stable condition, emergency responder Fajtlová stated.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor injuries to his ribs and was taken to hospital.
For parcels from countries outside the EU, new rules apply, and customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheis orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly collects trading cards.
It's usually a few dollars, say, ten dollars, where it's still worth bringing in, especially from Japan, where postage is often free, he says.
From October, ordering small parcels became slightly more expensive, he now has to add VAT and send the data for customs clearance to the post.
He receives an email saying that customs officials are expecting the package to arrive.
Then you just fill in the details of the consignment, and if the DPH did not include the trader in the sale, the customs office will charge him for the consignment and the transport from the total amount.
If the recipient does not arrange for customs clearance themselves, the customs fee must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisel, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I peel off one or two sticky labels, insert two pages and I'm done.
For me it is usually a question of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all deliveries are successful.
Due to new customs regulations, the number of international parcels received in Prague dropped from 60,000 to 15,000 a day.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not react to calls for information that are necessary to complete customs proceedings.
Currently there are 30,000 items of mail at the international post, which we have to process.
If people filled in all the information that is needed and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Inflation solution
As the title suggests, how would you propose to tackle the current inflation?
Currently we are at 9.9% inflation and it is expected to rise further.
What do you think should be done to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We can see in Poland, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the right path for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with what it speeds towards?
Prices are rising faster than wages, it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford the basics, especially energy.
How much did you get, for example, added (who is an employee)?
This year they added 2% in gross, which is a slap in the face, but fortunately I have a similar income from my business, which I run alongside my job.
Someone was able to explain to me why the perpetrators of proven violence are sent behind bars for only six months?
I just can't understand how a court can sentence such an animal to only six months behind bars, just to do it/her again as soon as it gets out.
Six months is nothing compared to the fact that its victim will be traumatised for several years, negatively affecting their sex life and overall relationships.
And by the way, it's not true that a rape victim never recovers.
Does this fail to disclose potential future reports of rape victims?
Man from Hroby "blew up" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hroby unintentionally helped the guards to arrest his nationwide sought girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He called her himself.
He did it with a snap.
First he approached a passerby and invented a story that he had been robbed.
Officers who answered the 999 call arrived at the scene and were stunned when the alleged victim told them he had made up the whole thing so they would come to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to ask the guards how to notify the police.
When checking the identity of the man and his companion, the guards discovered that the woman was on a list of persons sought, nationwide, and a warrant for her arrest was issued.
The case is therefore being handled by the PČR.
An honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally think that Slavs are not ethnically or culturally the same anymore, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with you, it's a shame Churchill couldn't get the US to liberate Prague :')
Of course I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
I don't know, it's quite a question, whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence, just because it potentially could bring benefit.
I would not personally regard such a case as a true act of faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal here, there are probably around ten thousand different religions in the world, if you don't count the different denominations.
Which god or gods then does man choose?
I would say it's quite likely that in one of those thousand religions there is at least one god who will send you to eternal damnation if you don't believe in his particular god.
In any case, in the ten, there is no other god but Jahve.
Therefore, in such a case, it would not have been more rational to withhold belief in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one of the thousands of gods and have that one send me to hell or something similar?
Others: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserve.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months for one) and under the guidance of professionals with practical experience.
If you're good at it, you might get a professional offer.
Something like this would suit all components of the ACR.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can talk like this: Collaboration between the educational sector and industry is constantly increasing, companies are fishing in schools and there is some kind of merging when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to work.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is constantly ongoing, we are all constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Something similar should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I see it as a way of building a relationship between a citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that Russia will never invade here again.
I find it funny how NATO is considered something carved in stone, we have allies and they will therefore defend us if anything happens.
No pleasure in the world.
It only takes one election in the US to screw their budget and the whole NATO goes bankrupt.
The English exchange us for Russian trash, the Germans exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they are enough to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that functions as a guarantee of independence in the long term is an armed army and a population that can master the military technology of their time.
Today, every teenager can pilot a remotely controlled vehicle without any problems.
We don't need the border fortifications, they are an anachronism today, but the remote-controlled teenager will get the better of him.
How to survive a crab tsunami
Unwrap presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're home with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is used again by e-shops, which do not have packaging materials.
This led to the creation of a map of stores where your used containers are accepted.
Not only about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
So it is damage to treat them as one-off waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper packaging to the participating shops (the KAMsNIM.cz project includes almost 150 of them).
This supports small businesses, reduces the amount of waste created and avoids overcrowded blue containers.
Shops themselves welcome packaging, which there is currently a shortage of on the market, and also saved money, since corrugated cardboard has become 50% more expensive in recent times.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, this also strengthens their brand.
One such business is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-drugs and eco-cosmetics.
Krabice and packaging materials are delivered to Popůvek near Brno by individuals who have accumulated at home, but we also hear from companies that have regular collections of postponed cardboard.
We use everything when packing parcels from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are creating a more considerate world.
Our aim is to preserve the sources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz application not only shows collection points for packaging material.
If you need to get rid of anything (take your recyclable rubbish to the tip, return expired medication, old tyres, scrap batteries, bulky waste and so on).
All waste can end up in the right place, and reusable items will find their second home.
In total, the map of the project contains more than 100,000 such places.
“Slowly, there are added collection yards, re-use centres, containers for textiles, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find use for things that would otherwise be waste,” adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the app from the association Ukliďme Česko.
I find it more worrying that in today's world of technology, it is so simple and addictive that children who use a computer or a phone play games but do not learn the basic computer skills in the process.
Recently there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of components on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple's Photos app or even mobile phones generally just hide the underlying filesystem with its files and put everything on one screen in the app.
Quietly, if they use the technology from an early age, but above all, if they learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU, starting in January, and it was magnificent.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the logo for the presidency, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the streets - and mentioned so many initiatives that half a year will not be enough to achieve them.
But French politicians are happy with it and so are their voters.
Macron's backers on the right and left agree on little, but just on Europe.
In France, new presidential elections will be held in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader also mentioned that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators rushed to criticise Macron, accusing him of propaganda in favour of Europe and of distorting history.
In fact, it is an attempt to rewrite history.
The far-right candidate for French president, Éric Zemmour, is currently touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and has had great success with this.
Let's take Macron's idea of a history textbook seriously and not get distracted by what's happening in France.
Was it not necessary?
Students in European countries learn history as the story of us versus them, never as the story of the whole.
Spaniards, French and Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know the broader context of the event.
Film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The film, which returns to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won awards for directing and best actress for Jasna Duričić.
At last year's Karlovy Vary festival, it was one of the most popular films with the audience.
The best actor in Berlin went to Anthony Hopkins for his role in Father.
I'm not that young, I'm not that healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being pregnant" I had diarrhea for a couple of days and didn't really feel like smoking...
It was worse than the usual flu.
I don't have an appetite with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I don't claim that everyone is like that)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas double issue, which will be released on December 20, will include a traditional literary supplement.
And cultural tips will come with it.
We are adding this for you, our premium subscribers, to this digital edition, so that, in case you don't have enough time to get the books as Christmas gifts, you can at least read them.
Prosaic texts that follow on from the previous similar collection by Petříček, Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
More observations of the world and descriptions of everyday things with a unique poetic attentiveness, depth and atmosphere.
In his second novel, photographer Šesták tries to capture the essence of small towns and the Czech way of life.
A tale of returning to one's roots that turns out to be nothing but a desired illusion.
The Czechist and comparatist transfers the fairy tale of the Red Cabbage into the backdrop of the contemporary village.
Its depiction of brutality exceeds the gory standard of the folkloric version and amps up the horror with emotional hollowness.
About the fact that the way back to instincts is shorter than what man is willing to admit
In his latest novel, the author tells a much less sentimental tale of returning from exile than we have come to expect.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to have a common life.
Trains are starting to run according to the new timetable, and some operators are changing
Trains will start running according to the new timetable from Sunday.
The biggest change is the change of operators on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet will replace České dráhy.
In most cases, only the departure time will be changed, and possibly the route as well.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the rails.
Sellers of tickets started during the autumn.
Czech Railways is planning to operate a daily average of 6,783 passenger trains in the new timetable, including a daily average of 4,780 long-distance trains.
Trains will cover around 11.8 million kilometres during the new timetable.
Trains will also run alongside domestic routes in the new timetable to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, together with the new timetable, deploys dozens of new trains.
The main new feature will be the InterJet trains, which will run on the Prague to Cheb lines.
Other new trains will be operated by the transport company in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The transport company will also increase prices for tickets by an average of 3.2 percent next year.
Trains take inflation into account when setting their fares every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry to line R23 from Ústí nad Labem to Mělník to Nymburk to Kolín.
The operator will replace Czech Railways here after success in the ministry of transport's competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 trains on the line, eight in each direction.
Other changes relate to long-distance trains between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at the stations of Havlíčkův Brod, Zdar nad Sázavou and Kolín from Sunday.
Leo Express has preserved its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the operator tried to keep disruptions to a minimum and to maintain as close to normal train times as possible.
Without major changes, the operation of trains by Arrivy and other operators should continue.
The operator is also changing on some regional lines.
Travellers can expect changes, for example in the Czech Republic, where the trains of the Czech Republic will be replaced on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk by the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn.
Travellers will also be able to use a single ticket on the railway for the second year.
Like Czech Railways, their price will increase by 3.2 percent due to inflation.
I must dissent.
Do we not learn from the other side's point of view?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to suffer.
In my life I have never heard a lecture from the point of view of the slave owners or from that time when nobody justifies it, they just condemn it.
Nobody tells you in schools that blacks often sold other blacks into slavery and that they were often the worst slave traders.
No one at school teaches you that colonizers often bought land from Indians, everywhere they just tell you how brutally we, Europeans, exterminated them, while they were exterminating each other for a long time.
For some time I also spent in the USA, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern schools.
I haven't met anyone who would deliberately omit facts, but I have heard before that this was the case and for me that is a problem, I cannot ignore it (in Japan, for example, the war crimes of WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was that history is not black and white, and that we have a tendency to look at it through the lens of today, without understanding.
History is not about other people's feelings, it's just a fact, and I think it's a fatal error to judge without looking at the context of the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from this and never do it again.
By way of example, when we get to those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and those slave-owning generals are really popular, but on the other hand, they did have some of their good old successes and it's absurd to disown them.
In addition, the North was not much better, as many people today idealize it.
A lot of people also forget that not all people in the South were slave owners and a lot of things were against them.
I would not have believed that from Russia, they deliberately leave out certain facts, lie and manipulate, and besides, our point of view does not exist there (on YT there was even a video from TV where someone started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What I found amusing at US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that their country never experienced.
Overall, I found it disturbing that on some campuses it was disturbing, those students were radicalized and those schools were supporting them.
When I think of the fact that these people will be much older one day, it makes me a little sad that this could be the voice of the majority, because among young people it is, and in the ruling elite too.
I think that feminism has already achieved what it set out to do long ago, and that it has become radicalized.
At present, those who call themselves feminists are those who have nothing in common with it and ignore the basic biological fact, and this leads to radicalisation on both sides, where it often leads to resistance, even for quite reasonable things.
In addition, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
In any case, at the end, I have not met anyone who would blame me for colonialism or slavery.
I rather met with bad geography, but it was two-way:D
Not because I would not like it here, but because it is completely pointless according to me.
Am I proud of something I couldn't do myself?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole to be unnecessary from the point of view of some kind of personal identity.
If I have something in common with people, a view of the world and shared experiences, not a place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but this is what I know: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
This Slovak priest is a great guy, his sermons are more theological than political, but then he always goes off on a tangent about coronavirus, how everyone is ashamed.
And here, of course, is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
They are officially Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernism and are actually Catholic without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics but go to the Orthodox service with the Hussites, because it's very similar theologically, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically valuable functionalist church on the street Botanická.
Otherwise the Church of St. Michael on Dominikánské náměstí belongs to the Dominicans and even there they say mass in Latin every Sunday at 3 p.m. as they did before Vatican II.
The Plaminec from Betlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts brought it from Austria
Břeclav - The Plaminek candle, lit in Bethlehem where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the pandemic of coronavirus, but in the morning they took him over the border from his Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing.
On the border, they were taken over by the police.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year with the group and are looking forward to it.
It is an honor for me that I have been chosen, said the scout Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
While the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, it is now taking place at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing, on the car park.
Usually, scouts go to Vienna by train.
The spread of the virus across the Czech Republic remains unchanged.
With the Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally went to Brno by train, where they handed it over to the Bishop of Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent transportation of the lights will be taken care of by the scout couriers, who will be travelling on selected express trains and regular trains.
They will take over the light from them at the stations, and local scouts or volunteers will then spread the flame across the Czech Republic and wherever the rails go.
This year, scouts must abide by the applicable measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It's done the same way as lone.
We would like to recommend both courier teams and organisers of local events to wear masks, to try to maintain a distance, there should be as few as possible, not to sing along with colleagues, in short, to behave in such a way as to make it as safe as possible, said the spokeswoman for the Bethlehem Light campaign, Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of the Bethlehem star, which travels through Europe, was born in Austria in 1986.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and harmony at the same time as the flame.
The Bethlehem light is for believers a symbol of hope, light that conquers darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and guides have been dealing with its spread for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, making the torch a symbol of selflessness and humaneness.

I don't have an economic education so I don't know the basics of economics that would confirm that the subsidy is good for the economy, but I don't think that the subsidy as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, the environment (such as water retention), healthcare and education make use of these funds in the proper way, and I do not understand why these funds are being used for agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As it is mentioned - unnecessary products are produced and they burden the free market and "the natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where there are millions of announcements on the corridors saying "financed/co-financed by project xy". Such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not support for the company that gives work to x people, this is suffocation of development when this company holds on and takes contracts/employees from other companies, which after its collapse could grow and become more productive.
Absolutely, it's terrible.
Occasionally, even a person who was born in the Internet age can get caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think I'm immune to internet advertising, but then I catch myself being influenced by it - it's just so ingrained now, that people can't help but be influenced by it.
For this reason, I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to give a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all just a big scam, as the saying goes - I'd ban the internet if I could.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots (but mainly in point 1):
1. "I'm not going to believe something just because most people do and it makes sense, I'm not an idiot, but I'd rather believe something that is less probable because it makes sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion and stand by it because it's critical thinking"
2. "I will not believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television is following the trend of Christmas films, there are two hundred premieres this year
Los Angeles - Chinese TV station and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen victim to the trend of Christmas films, and this year they will show record numbers of more than 200 to their viewers.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring highly with the public in recent years and significantly increasing viewing figures, so these films are being made more and more.
This year, four times as many Christmas films were made as in 2011, and twice as many as five years ago.
IMDb's database, however, only includes those films that have the word Christmas (Vánoce) in their title, so the actual number of Christmas films will be much higher.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is associated above all with fairy tales, and globally with films such as Home Alone, Love in the Sky or the classic Christmas film The Good Life from 1946.
The real boom in Christmas pictures, however, started in 2009 when the American cable television channel Hallmark launched a special film series, the BBC server remembers.
Her festive project, Countdown to Christmas (Adding Up to Christmas), which included four films at the time, was a big hit.
This year, this station started to prepare its viewers for Christmas on 22 October and will show a total of 42 Christmas films.
Competitor Lifetime has 35 new Christmas films in its programme this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
In this enchanted time of the story, it doesn't really matter what happens, what's important is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background, and it's snowing," author Brandon Gray, who wrote a book on Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies (I'll be home for Christmas movies).
For the audience it's an escape and a way of at least feeling calm for two hours in the middle of all the Christmas madness and the madness of the world that we've been living in the last couple of years," added Gray.
According to him, for example, television channel Hallmark uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there's some misunderstanding about half-an-hour before the end, which is resolved nicely and they kiss.
That's always the case, and as long as all the films look the same and have the same atmosphere, people will follow one another around, adds Gray.
Mazepin had a positive text on Covid-19, and will not affect the final F1 race.
Only 19 drivers will take part in the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on Covid-19 and will not miss the last race of the season.
Team Haas will only have one car on the track.
In the last race of the season, he was aiming for a better position from 20th place, which he achieved in qualifying.
Russia's Nikita Mazepin will not take part in the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
He had tested positive for Covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will be on the starting grid, and from the back of the grid, Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, and from the front, Max Verstappen, who will compete in the direct battle for the title with Lewis Hamilton.
According to the Haas team, Mazepin is in a relatively good condition and does not show any signs.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will be guided by the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with the safety of all participants being the ultimate priority," its representatives told formula1.com.
Haas does not send a replacement driver to the race, nor can it.
Any replacement would have to complete qualification or a ride in another part of the weekend.
There is no first case of Covid-19.
At the start of the season that is about to finish, Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19, while Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton were tested positively.

They are to help their Polish colleagues guard the border with Belarus and build a planned fence.
Poland officially asked for help from NATO states in connection with several months of actions by the Belarusian regime, which on its territory calls citizens of near Eastern countries with a false promise of easy crossing of the Union border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating in Poland.
Is the mutation Omikron spreading to the south of Moravia?
Hygiena is investigating another case of a child from Adamov.
Currently, we have another suspicion of this kind concerning another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
There is no proof of direct contact with previous cases from ZŠ Adamov,“ said Ciupek.
Six cases were reported in the region in the last week.
We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant among our six cases - it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for influenza and other respiratory viruses at the State Health Institute in Prague, said the director.
She added that it was two nurses from one hospital department, Fakultní nemocnice Brno, and two children of one of them, plus two eleventh graders from ZŠ Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms according to the director, four asymptomatic.
No one with suspicions of Omikron travelled abroad
None of the people mentioned had travelled abroad, nor had any of their families, and there had been no contact with anyone who would be staying abroad.
There is no connection with the championships in water polo, said Ciupek.
Head hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously said that they were checking an international water polo tournament that took place in Brno a few weeks ago.

California limits gun sales.
Wants to proceed like Texas with abortion ban.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan on Saturday to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state using a legal mechanism similar to the one Texas enacted in its controversial abortion bill.
People would then have a right to claim damages in any lawsuits filed by anyone who makes or sells assault weapons or homemade firearms in California.
The announcement by Newsom came in response to a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday that left in place a Texas law that bans most abortions, though it is at odds with a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established a nationwide right to abortion about 24 weeks into a pregnancy.
However, the court did not now rule on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on a technical issue which arises from the innovative structure of the measure.
In this case, the ban was imposed on the public, which made it impossible to challenge it through the usual legal channels.
I am outraged by the recent (Thursday) decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which allowed Texas to maintain most of its harmful abortion restrictions and undermine Texas's effort to protect its citizens," the California governor said.
If states can now block reviews of their laws by federal courts, California will use this power to protect human life," Newsom continued.
He allegedly tasked his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the minister of justice on a measure that would allow the representative of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
This is how homemade weapons, which do not have serial numbers and which could be used to circumvent regulations, are designated.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to seek at least $10,000 (€220,000) in damages from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault weapons, accessories for "ghost guns" or ammunition in California.
If the most effective way to keep these weapons off our streets is through the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
AP reports that California had banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but a federal judge recently blocked the state's ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to truly reinstate the ban using a Texas-based template, it would lend credence to the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in a dissenting opinion last week warned against extending the legal mechanism to other American states.
However, the Supreme Court did not give full immunity from legal review to the Texas ban, allowing abortion clinics to continue their lawsuits against selected officials in the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has a public testing phase, during which it gradually becomes clear how the vaccination scheme will look and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
For example, studies from Israel on the effects of 4 doses are already underway.
According to this study, the majority of patients experience a fivefold increase in antibodies, which has the mentioned long-term effect.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its vaccination schedule at some point, it's just taking a bit of time.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises ten times higher efficiency, will soon be launched.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would be acting unlawfully if it were to use the new powers and suspend payments to Poland over the legal state dispute.
The Commission has postponed the approval of the Polish plan for drawing 36 billion euros from the EU budget to revive the economy hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism that would allow it to withdraw EU funding from countries that violate the principles of the rule of law.
Poland should answer this blackmail from the EU with a veto in all areas that require unanimity, said Ziobro, leader of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its slim majority in parliament.
Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices, added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland suspends its contributions to the EU.
It would have been justifiable due to the fact that the EU unlawfully withholds funds from our joint budget, to which we also contribute, said the Polish minister.
His party's stance on EU accession is more radical than that of the ruling party, Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that Polish justice underwent during Mr Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is setting "impossible conditions because its goal is not a legal state, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing a "political dictate imposed by blackmail and attempts to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," said Ziobro.
He said Poland should be part of an EU based on partnership between sovereign states, not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels, which would limit Poland's sovereignty.
We will never agree that Poland should be a colony, he said.
But to admit that... Over in Lidl we have one type of cheese on four different shelves.
I didn't touch anything else, I met the same yoghurt a couple of times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the cheese counter I gave up and asked.

If expelled, I won't go to any market, not even the one by the square, where they don't have such a selection, but they usually have everything I need, and it's all in order, so I'll have it done in ten minutes.

As a child, I was punished with a whip.
It was never because of marks, it was usually just that I repeatedly refused to listen and got angry (read instead of going to sleep, washed the dishes, etc.).
At the same time, I have never been punished without being warned, and my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, she would give me a bruise (sometimes even after another "tap" she only brought and put it there so I would see it).
Only after repeatedly refusing to listen did I receive a few kicks in the buttocks (through clothing).
I personally think that corporal punishment (in a reasonable way and measure) is useful because the child reacts much more to it than to words.
It's important to me that there is that part with the warning because it gives the child in a way to choose whether they don't listen and get it or they improve and the punishment will not be.
In the end, I usually just needed a warning to start listening.
Defending the system
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, Vojtěch Cepl, was answering a journalist's question in 1999 as to what the Czech constitution meant to him - whether a sacred text to which one swears an oath and which is taught in schools from an early age, or else an agreement which can be changed if necessary - he definitely opted for the first definition.
Once we agreed on the democratic rules of our life in the institute, which at the same time define who is the state and its citizens, and with changes it is better to save.
Imagine: some nations even have their own rules.
As the Czechs love dumplings with pork and cranberries, Vojtěch Cepl answered the question at that time.
In recent times, however, there has been a growing opinion among lawyers that the Czech Constitution needs amending.
The season is being tested by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not predict, such as the behaviour of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
All that we know about such documents suggests that political interference in their text must be considered.
The institute needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to overcoming most crises that companies encounter across history.
The constitution is, among other things, a kind of rule of governance consisting of individual rules that set out the conditions of the game for politicians.
We are worried that too much will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we are linking bans.
At the same time, however, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to use their power.
Covid doesn't discriminate, in FN Brno, a few months old baby is fighting for its life
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder in children, there have also been severe cases which have posed a problem for hospitals, especially in recent days.
We know that children are endangered and affected less than adults, speaking of 2 to 5 percent compared to adults, said the head of the Department of Paediatric Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Faculty Hospital Brno and the Medical Faculty of Masaryk University Petr Dominik to Novinky.
The course of the disease is usually much easier, lighter, and often occurs without symptoms.
However, there are child patients who are seriously ill with the virus, which we can see especially in the last period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, it is about dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
This takes place at the clinic for child infectious diseases.
Seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on ARU.
Children with post-covid syndromes were on the ward continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
Now there is an increase in children with acute Covid-19 pneumonia, which means lung inflammation requiring admission to an intensive care bed," he said, adding that the disease is not limited to adults, but also affects adolescents and premature babies.
In hospitals, there are also children in a serious condition due to coronavirus.
„At the moment we have babies of several months and adolescents,“ the chief physician said.
However, he is happy that so far in the children's hospital FN Brno they have not recorded any child deaths from coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 years died in the CR on 6 December.
According to Dominik, a psychologist is an indispensable part of the collaboration in the pediatric hospital – not only in the coronavirus department.
At the same time, it warns that, just as with adults, vaccination reduces the severity of the disease and the number of cases of COVID-19.
For this reason, we recommend vaccinations for children too,“ the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk along marked paths.
But those quiet zones are not quite as big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on maps.cz.
In general, you can walk wherever you like in the national parks outside the quiet zones (but don't walk over the fence into the meadow).
Skiing/cycling in the woods outside marked trails is not allowed anywhere if you don't have an exemption (but of course it's not really monitored in national parks).

China is building an image of having handled the outbreak well and that the authoritarian regime is weathering the crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building an image of having mastered the epidemic and that the authoritarian regime is better dealing with the crisis.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was reflecting criticism for not being able to stop the outbreak, which has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in infected people.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective gear, and Chinese doctors are helping in the battle against the coronavirus, for example in the worst-hit Italy.
How to read Beijing's intentions?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
You meet a friend and say to him: do you not want to eat the elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife likes it because it mows the lawn, washes the car with a hose, and the children play with it.
Just a parade.
If you want to buy the elephant for 5000, I'll sell it to you.
Friend: we'll do it, it will be a parade...
After some time they meet again and the one who bought it complains: you fool, what did you sell it for a mule?
The lawn is trampled, there are huge puddles everywhere, the car is totaled, the children are playing in it, and the wife wants a divorce.
The guy who sold it says: You don't talk about a rhinoceros, you don't sell a rhinoceros...
World events are controlled by the great powers.
Despite the equality of sovereign states, it is precisely the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can become such a power only if it works on its integration.
So far, it is operating on the level of economic and political (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think Europe is heading for federalization.
It will not take 10, 15 or 20 years.
But in the middle of the century, attitudes will be different and it will work.
It also occurred to me and it is quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so I might be wrong.
I'm just going by the fact that the ellipse usually includes two different units on the same level.
I'll borrow a example from another comment "Spanish cherries and mandarins", where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is not clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
I also base this on the fact that the sentence says "all U.S. forces," including their weapons, and that I know that U.S. complexes are operated only by Americans.
In short, I expect that it is included in that broad concept and it is not necessary to specify it further for American forces.
But again, just for fun:D
Either way, it's an absurd demand

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured monkey Milly
Disturbing footage shows the moment the terrified monkey scurried into the toilet cubicle, before its heartless owner smacked it and laughed at it.
Holland also fed her parakeets, kebabs and hamburgers regardless of their actual nutritional needs.
Magistrates' court in Gwent has now banned her for life from keeping animals, The Sun reports.
Experts in the rehabilitation of apes, who are looking after Milly after her ordeal, say they have never seen a more traumatised primate.
Milly spent almost two years being rehabilitated by the staff at Monkey World in Dorset, and now happily plays with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The four-time mother pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to protected animals.
At the Magistrates' Court in Gwent, she was handed a 12-month sentence, suspended for 12 months.
Hollandová was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, a life-long ban on keeping animals and must pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
Steph Sawyer, head of the Small Monkeys team which rehabilitated the abused animal, said: 'Milly is fine but her rehabilitation will continue.'
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from anyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her let out a yelp.
Opička refused to eat for a long time.
Now, when she has settled down and is happy with her mate, the sight of new humans can still trigger panic in her.
Mental scars from abuse will always remain, Sawyer says.
The abuse of Milly came to light after police in Gwent discovered disturbing footage on the woman's phone following a raid on her home over drugs allegations.
You can hear Milly swear in the background.
In another video, you can hear Holland offering the monkey cocaine and saying: "Do you want cocaine?"
So I licked my fingers.
In May, together with her partner Russell Cox (43), she admitted to having cocaine with the intention of selling it.
Cocaine was found hidden in Kinder eggs worth £1,600 in her home.
Cox was then sentenced to 30 months and Holland to 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from this prehistory three times in a row when you bravely jump over the entire 20th century?
Will you take the same things to the first grade as you did in the sixth?
The whole thing is killed by the idea of bifling, when nobody, except for exceptions, is interested whether you can do it or not.
The main thing is to write a test for 1 and then nobody cares.
Run and randomly people meet on the street, whether they can handle the character roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients.
Everyone goes through it, and most people don't even blink and tell you that it's absolutely fine.
So what does this curve teach you?
I'm a big fan of the general overview and the fact is that people don't want it and don't need it.
At that moment it is unnecessary and you will never get it.
Partly it is taught for all those people who will need that particular thing.
But as, there's a note here that you don't need to know any of this when you're standing next to the machine... ...because you just don't need to know.
And we're slowly getting to a time when not knowing is the mark of a punk.
On which we probably also have our communist past to thank, and our continuing suspicion of elites and intellectuals) But the price of that is high.
If, for example, journalists were able to count, the covid here probably never reached these dimensions.

The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea moves there with him, at least until he returns to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
As you can see, their relationship not only ended in love, but rather grew into mutual contempt, if not outright hatred.
This was planned by you! Outraged, Kadri reacted to Andreino's accusations of lies, gambling and debts.
Kadri's alleged honesty is not appreciated by his ex-wife or his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
We normally don't talk about such things and we never talked about it in the family.
I don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone who is trying to drag my loved one's name through the mud, I just can't deal with it!
I'm sorry I have to do it this way, but I want to publicly thank my brother Kadir for being such a character and helping our family when we needed it the most, even though he was so young.
The more I read such false information, the more I shiver, because it is probably taken out of context.
I would be delighted if everyone knew Kadri as I do, our close friends and family, in response to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful for everything!
Obviously people will believe what they're reading, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love and know him and know the truth and know what really happened, she said.
Drunken thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
Don't believe it, for whatever reason.
Cchao started his criminal operation in the parking lot of the residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the information available, the fine was eventually reduced to approximately 330 korunas from one vehicle.
Then he couldn't think of anything better than to climb up to the fifth floor and throw himself into the apartment through the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
A security camera caught him on film as he walked down the street away from the scene, eating a banana.
When the apartment owner awoke in the morning, he discovered that the bananas were not where they were supposed to be and called police.
It then stopped Cchaa.
The man admitted to drinking alcohol on the day in question.
As he needed money, he decided to steal while drunk.
The whole thing is currently under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the facade and stole two bananas on the fifth floor.
The pandemic law is time-limited and effective only in case of pandemic readiness.
When that is repealed, the law will not be effective.
Law limits the scope of business
Is that not enough for you as a reason?
The right to gather will be limited, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters came to the Saturday elections to the municipal councils of four municipalities
On Saturday, people voted for new municipal councils in the towns of Komňa on Uherskohradišťsko, Lužice on Mostecko, Nová Ves on Liberecko and in Rovná on Pelhřimovsko.
The number of councillors in these towns fell below the number stipulated by law or the elected council there dissolved.
In total, 99 candidates competed for the 28 seats.
The average age of the newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33.
The processing of the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year.
They took place in them altogether four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said the chairman of the Czech Statistical Office Eva Krumpová.
He reminded that the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personal security due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
In Komňa near Uherský Brod, the Association of Independent Candidates won the Saturday's elections, gaining 27.76 percent of votes and two mandates in the seven-seat municipal council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means winning two mandates.
Občané pro Komňu also won two seats on the council, securing 18.52 percent of the vote.
Znovu se do zastupitelstva dostala i dosavadní starostka obce Jan Křižková, která je členkou soukromníků.
Komňany - independents - got one seat on the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná on Pelhřimov, the Pro Rovnou association won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, meaning four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were also elected to the municipal council.
The turnout was 93.62 percent.
Repeat elections in Lužice on the Mosteck region have again been won by the Lužice and Svinčice Association led by mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 percent of the votes and, like in 2018, has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The second-placed candidate was the Mayors' Association, which received 43.27 percent of the votes, and will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the urns.
Elections in Nové Vsi on Liberecku were won by independent candidates Naděje pro Novou Ves ahead of the ANO Movement.
For the association of independent candidates voted 59.88 percent of voters and won four places in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and increased against the regular elections in 2018, won more mandates and has three.
The turnout was 42.9 percent of eligible voters.
The results of the elections will be discussed by the State Election Commission on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think, would it be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you all know what is going on here.
You're just playing the fool so he'll have someone to "chat" with.
If not, it's sad.
I do not say that Christians are degenerates, nor anything like that.
Even I like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which after all was the goal that they should look good).
And to me, it's one thing, who believes in what.
On the other hand, I find it disturbing how much the Church had in the Middle Ages, all the money it made, the repression of science and so on.
I don't want to talk about all the wars that have been waged, for example, the Thirty Years' War
TL;DR: Believe in the spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell head first from twelve metres.
The impact on the concrete was survived.
An incredible fall was survived by a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, for whom rescue workers from the Moravian-Silesian Emergency Medical Service were called.
Employees at the regional operational centre received an emergency call an hour after Saturday's midnight with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two crews from the ZZS – medical and rescue – were immediately sent to the scene.
When they arrived at the scene doctors discovered that the 17-year-old had fallen from a height of around twelve metres, landing on his head on the concrete!
Coal was mined in Vítkovice.
But not quite, as it should have been, and the firefighters went to the scene.
When the rescue team arrived, the man was unconscious with multiple injuries and in imminent danger of death.
An emergency doctor intubated his airways, ensured artificial respiration and after further treatment as part of the emergency care before admission he was transported to the trauma centre in Ostrava by an ambulance, informed the spokesman for the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more afraid of the public's and authorities' inadequate reactions than of the coronavirus
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, but the first line of defense against infection is doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended his belt
MMA experienced a spectacular gala evening full of interesting results.
At UFC 269 things were happening.
Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to defeat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who hadn't lost for seven years.
Lightweight contender Charles Oliveira wasted no time, showcasing a brilliant submission against Dustin Poirier and defending his belt.
Kai Kara-France also won, defeating Cody Garbrandt by technical knockout in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his competitor.
A surprise, no one expected.
It brought the women's bantamweight bout between the famed Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered the mutual battle as a presumed "giant", since Nunes had not lost for seven years and was dreaming of another triumph.
The start of the duel also carried the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her path to victory with a lot of activeness and even gave her opponent a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
Penova, however, did not give in to any further mistakes and tried unsuccessfully to attack with a hook to the arm.
The second round was intense and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both fighters traded a multitude of impressive strikes and hard jabs.
Penova also tripped Nunes, who started falling to the ground.
It had to give up and retreat.
It was a huge shock for everyone when the American won.
The main event of the evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first it went better for Poirier, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the second, he tried to be more active Oliveira, who attempted to submit his opponent with a rear naked choke.
It didn't work out for him, but then he put a lot of pressure on his opponent, got behind him and delivered a flurry of punches.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to tap.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next bout, Sean O'Malley recorded a supreme victory as he dropped Raulian Paivu with a hard right to the jaw in the first round.
He followed that up with a flurry of precisely placed punches and notched his 15th victory.
Kara France then managed to defeat Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her daughter, now after seven years she lost.
Ten knee, or that knee?
At first glance, it's nothing complicated.
In Czech, most essential nouns express only one grammatical gender, and it is not therefore a problem to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or common.
However, there is also a fairly large group of substantives whose gender is not determined.
Such significant names oscillate between two genders.
Plurals are formed by adding -y or -ies to the singular, and in some cases the plural remains unchanged.
For example, words such as "svízel" or "kyčel" are of the masculine and feminine gender, in the first case according to the pattern of "machine", in the second according to the pattern of "song".
In a further group of substantial nouns, different forms are already found in the first person singular, for example: "row/row", "bed/bed" or "potato/potatoes" (in the sense of food).
Both words are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore interchangeable.
Some words can vary regionally, for example, "okurka" in the Czech Republic and "okurek" in Moravia, in this case, however, the Moravian variant is colloquial, in the same way as there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih" and so on.
Some words that have entered the Czech language from other languages are originally unchangeable, but gradually adopt Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is male as well as female, or the word "bufet", which remains in the middle gender but has endings according to the masculine pattern of "hrad".
Turkey opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation directly on the Greek borders?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border because of the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people have begun to cross the southern border of the Schengen area since Ankara stopped protecting them.
European politicians have promised Greece support, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What really motivates refugees to take the uncertain journey?
What is the situation on the ground?
We haven't seen the blue sky in three months and we've been suffocating, the Sydney-based journalist writes
Devastating fires, which Australia has been battling for four months, have killed almost three dozen people and millions of animals and razed millions of hectares of land.
How are local authorities and residents coping with the disaster?
Could the Morrison government have done more to mitigate the effects, as critics have argued?
What will the country have to do to prepare for the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks to journalist Ika Detrichova from Sydney.
False accusations are always and everywhere rare.
So I always write about everyone.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with the fact that sexual violence is widespread in our society and that it is covered up.
I do not personally know anyone who was falsely accused.
I know many people who have been raped and I have seen how their surroundings often behave towards them or even the police.
The victims should always be believed.
It has become a trend that the victims finally open up about their traumas.
But lots of people don't do it.
Yes, there will be people who falsely accuse someone.
It is disgusting and offensive to all victims of sexual violence, but spreading the idea that "most accusations are false" and that it is a "trend" helps only sexual predators.
Czech Republic flooded with half-built houses, families can't afford to finish them
Prices of construction materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people got into a tricky situation.
It does not have the means to complete the family homes that are already under construction, and the bank will not increase mortgage loans.
Besides the cost of materials, the cost of construction works is also increasing.
People therefore do not have enough money to finish the family homes that are already under construction.
In many cases, banks are refusing to increase mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case scenario, people move into half-built and unfinished houses.
In the worst case scenario, the houses that are being built are uninhabitable, and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgages as well as the rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses a year, and that has happened to us fifty percent of the time.
For us as a building firm it is difficult in that we have to abide by some things contractually even though the material has gone up in price.
So we're doing it for free," said builder Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people will only have financial problems.
If they were counting on the building coming in at five million, it's going to be seven now.
I think some people will wait," added Slivon.
The most material was damaged by lead, iron and also installation and heating equipment.
Construction companies are also struggling with a lack of workforce.
In the Czech Republic there is a lack of graduates in construction trades and the influx of foreign workers is slowing down the pandemic.
The situation regarding the issuing of building permits is more favourable at the moment.
The Building Authority issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago, Křeček specified.
We are doing well and will do even better.
Real vision is missing, says commentator for ČRo - Radio Wave
Besides the traditional New Year's celebrations, politicians have for years been using the occasion to make political statements.
This year, in addition to the prime minister and the leader of ANO, Andrej Babiš, the nation was addressed by the president, Miloš Zeman, and the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
What did we learn?
As it happens, the master's degree is perfect for me, I have my own topic which I chose, which is linked to my bachelor's degree, I always do that for a whole year and then write it up over a week or two.
State councillors are completely at ease with us if people are not total idiots and something has remained in their heads, the commission will not bother them with theory.
I had to learn the state anthem for a week and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical deduction that I immediately got and I had it right.
Otherwise, with those projects, you know people who will pay someone to do their semester project for them (we did that a lot, really useful, you learn a lot), and then just learn the project and be prepared.
According to me, it is great when at the end of the subject there is an examination, to which the knowledge gained within the project is applied, not just the defence.
All is well, but do not email or call the embassy and do not send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same as them.
Those people at the embassy have nothing in common with you.
If they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so they may have to play with them because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can calmly put up a statue of Putin next to the statue of the bear.
But he should give it to Xi Jinping so that he can sit on it or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing artists under the bus.
If you post a story every day and at least one picture every second day, you will reach an absolute minimum.
Furthermore, it changes what is more important for the function, whether the link, comment or storage.
I found it terrifying recently so I may have to slow down to a ticktock where there are a lot of successful artists from my generation who haven't done that.
In the end, I might even be glad, if something user-friendly came along that didn't drain all the creativity and energy out of artists
Declaration of the Party of Workers of Donbass
The Union - yes, the break-up - no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR are expressing their opinion on the photo.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in history occurred.
In the Belovezhskaya Pushcha forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal power and violating the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with an open amicable attitude Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed an agreement that "the USSR as an international legal subject and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
One stroke of the pen "cancelled" a huge country with almost three million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens found themselves living abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
We have already lost more people than in both world wars combined, regardless of the loss of the Russian population of the former Soviet republics!
The same people, who in one sitting in the Berezovski forest destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
On purpose, they carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, and detached fourteen republics from the greatest world power that were economically linked in one mechanism.
If we want to look deeper, then we see the depopulation of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the growth of criminality, interethnic conflict, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, the war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical surrender, first of the socialist camp and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "power vacuum".
All that has been ruined and surrendered in a rush has quickly been filled and occupied by the NATO countries that have accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
The whole world is still shaken above all by events at the end of the eighties and the beginning of the nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in supermarkets with a high turnover does not necessarily correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 Kč / kg.
I buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making it into a stew for Thursday dinner.
In an alternative reality where I don't buy meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain reduces the price of meat to 99 Kč / kg - explain to me the mechanism by which meat, the price of which is changed, becomes a threat to my digestive system?
Or I could wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted by one day before the date of consumption for 69 Kč / kg - how would this meat differ from the one I bought on Monday for 120 Kč and put it in my freezer for 3 days?
I answer myself - nothing.
These guys, that when something is cheap, it must be substandard, second-rate or of poor quality - they're way behind the times; I'm telling you!
Recently I went to Brno to Hlavas and in the underpass lady was handing out some kind of leaflet, similar to things I always take, to help the brigadiers, they can't do anything...
No, the leaflet was full of rural common sense and conservative views on the way the world works, but nowhere was there anything about God, I was baffled, but I sensed it was some kind of provocation.
After reading it, I found out who was behind it and it turned out to be Scientology.
No, as it was a good lad, full of completely unnecessary advice, as if I need to be told and not be told.
If it were not for paper, forests would not need to be cut down.
Something similar I experienced with a former girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will get you to do things for this person because you like them even though you are not aware how much this situation is being taken advantage of in the bedroom.
She threatened me a few times because I went out with a guy she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she said goodbye and asked me not to eat anything.
Then she started physically blocking the doors.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another half a year passed and it fizzled out.
Then I ended the relationship with her and told her that we were splitting up and that I would call her next week to calm her down and not to do anything rash.
Such a person sucks the city, emotions and overall happiness from you.
Prefer to keep distance
When insurance companies here rush to buy mirage tests and hunt for positives who would not be tested for or know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we have achieved is complications for firms, the transport company and others, because their employees were given five days' domestic imprisonment.
In the West, they have given up on the flu jab and recognise that there is no point in trying to treat an ailment weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he still has to learn something and boost his ego by inventing buzzer beaters.
I hope that the old good thief is coming back to us.
After several years of decline and suppression, MLM recruiting is back in the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old and a first-year university student), initial promises of training products and commercial skills were quickly replaced by "this doesn't interest you, just get on with people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I was offering because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and intimidate people.
When the first earned dollars came in, people quickly realised that if you want to earn, you need to flog a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable things, so you felt like a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman.
What I can say is that the experience was valuable, people learned that you shouldn't jump on every scam and that information should be thoroughly checked.
At the same time, I would not put all of them in one basket.
People in this business are successful and even profitable, but they won't be congratulating themselves on a job well done with expensive consumer goods or "skinny" bank accounts.
In the corporation where I work, such things are not done.
HR is calm, managers look for their management and the powerful do not interfere with anything.
Therefore, regular evaluation is happening somehow, in the form of how it happens here (set some goals for the next year, look back at what came out and what didn't) - it's rather self-evaluation, not that someone is evaluating you according to some numbers, and so on.
Corporate campaigns are also voluntary.
But we are quite unique even within our company - some departments are more "corporate".
Sometimes a person has the feeling that we are such a start-up that is squatting in the offices of a large corporation.
But it doesn't really affect us that much until the results come in.
Czech woman missing in Britain is found dead.
Her body was found in London.
British police have been searching almost ten days for the missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday 12th December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in resignation, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that they had found the woman from Uherskohradište dead.
British police this afternoon confirmed to our embassy in London that they had found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not disclose any more information.
Sincere condolences, Kulhánek wrote on Twitter.
They last saw the young woman on 28 November as she was getting off the bus on her way home from work. She had withdrawn money from the cash machine before getting on the bus.
She was reported missing by colleagues five days later.
Following this, the London police started searching for her, and Interpol included her in the list of missing people worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police have already detained one man in connection with this.
What role he played in the case and what he is suspected of, but did not disclose.
In four municipalities, new town councils were elected at the end of the year
On Saturday 11 December the new municipal assemblies were elected in the towns of Komňa on Uherskohradišťsko, Lužice on Mostecko, Nová Ves on Liberecko and Rovná on Pelhřimovsko.
The number of councillors in these towns fell below the number stipulated by law or the elected council there dissolved.
In the new elections, 99 valid candidates competed for 28 mandates.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest turnout was recorded in Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters cast their ballots.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the municipal councils in the four mentioned municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men vying for 28 seats on the council.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72.
The processing of the results of the Saturday elections for us symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year.
They took place in them four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work mostly under difficult epidemic conditions, which put greater demands on equipment and personal protection, said Eva Krumpová, 1st Deputy President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49.
The results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission on Monday and will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took a while to get used to the fact that we had a potentially dangerous contagious disease here, but we got there in the end.
I struggle to deal with the fact that a large part of the population is idiotic about this.
I'm looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) the most because thanks to it, I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not going.
He was stripped of his presidency and eligibility to hold it again.
There is a slim chance that it will happen, but as others have mentioned, it is not very likely.
In addition, I am not sure whether the carting away of the records could be considered treason at all.
Impeachment is such an act by which the president of the republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate lives: More people under 35 going a year without sex
The more young adults in the US live their lives without sex.
They are mainly religious people, the Daily Mail website says.
Surveys show that from 2008 to 2021, the share of people under 35 who abstain from sex has risen from eight to 21 percent.
Women aged 18 to 35 who say they did not have sex in the past year is at its highest ever.
The decrease in the number of sexually active individuals is also influenced by other factors, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) shows.
One of them could be the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher rate of unemployment.
However, the presence of media, social networks or video games could also contribute to making sex less of a priority for young people.
Since 2010, the share of men and women aged 18 to 35 who say they did not have sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly, said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Among people in marriage, sexual activity is more frequent, and only 5% of them stated that they had been without sex for the past year in 2021.
Among the free, it was 29 percent. Stone added that marriage before age 35 is just a small minority.
The decrease in sexual activity is also due to fear of premarital sex and religious foundations.
Despite the fact that married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of women aged 25 to 35 who are married or in a relationship continues to fall.
Young people's opinions on premarital sex are divided - around 30% think it's a bad thing, while around 70% think it's okay.
It's true that they're a minority among free individuals in that age group, but their behavior is driving this trend," Stone said of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral objection to premarital sex, religion is the reason.
Since 2008, the proportion of abstinence among free people aged under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
The "less religious" trend rose from 10 to 20 percent," Stone said.
The decrease in sexual activities is also influenced by other factors, such as less social interaction and, above all, social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is smaller for people without work, or with low incomes.
Another reason could be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, "replacing" this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown during the pandemic of the coronavirus.
The whole issue of compulsory vaccination against Covid is whether society should be able to force a portion of the population to behave in a way they don't want to, but which will save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, and the one I find most interesting is the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether it would be our fault if we did not order it and they died.
My argument is that we certainly could have killed the 80-year-old man who, to be honest, didn't know much, we didn't explain it to him well, he heard some disinformation somewhere, and as a result he refused to be vaccinated and ended up dying.
On the other hand, I don't think that we can be held responsible for the death of an opponent of vaccinations who was lying next to the SPD and the KSČ whining about persecution and totalitarian state.
From those statistics I mentioned earlier, it is quite clear that most of the unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will actually be able to blame themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
The winter so far in the Czech Republic has brought one of the lowest snowfalls in recent times.
The operators of skiing areas cannot do without technical snow, and the weather complicates even the preparations for the Jizerska 50 ski race.
Is this a trend or an exception?
What does little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about goalkeepers.
Once in the middle school, our teacher led us through the whole city to the boat yard so we could row boats on the river.
On the way there we walked down one such very wide street and couldn't help but notice in the middle of it all - followers of the Hare Krishna cult.
Obviously, we underestimated them.
I managed to escape but ran into one of my friends.
When they left, we asked them and the teacher what they were saying.
They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have any souls," she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, was smiling the whole way until the shipyard.
We are devastated.
It's not happening that much, but the system is crumbling, says Orozovic
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honours.
We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations, said Morawiecki at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show that it will not accept violations of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, triggered by worrying movements of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border, is a matter that can be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, even within the "Normandy format" grouping France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine, according to the Chancellor.
Morawiecki said that the Chancellor was informed about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukašenko artificially created a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and a weapon, because every night we record a hundred attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He was talking to the Chancellor about further sanctions against Lukašenkos regime and his patrons in the Kremlin so that they finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz, according to the DPA agency, assured that Warsaw is counting on German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of the Lukashenko regime towards refugees.
Drunken Polish nun caused accident, tried to cover it up
The car returned to the scene of the accident a few minutes later, but was driven by another nun who tried to pass the blame onto herself.
When the police told her that she could still lose her licence for giving way and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came clean, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had run into the car, asking for help.
The police then came for sister Celestina.
They were breathalysed and when it was revealed she had more than twice the legal limit in her system, she was immediately stripped of her licence.
At the same time, they informed her that she would be questioned about her actions in court.
Pes Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič, however, did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have been inspired by American stories of dog lovers.
But they forgot one essential thing: the laws of the film craft.
After the charming film F. Brabce Gump - a dog that taught people how to live, now comes another film, Tady hlídáme my - We're Watching You, which deals with audience emotions in cinemas.
The co-author of the script and the director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič ml., freely continues his previous film Tady hlídám já from 2012.
The talking horse Hugo and some well-known characters return to the stage.
Julie and Ivan, owners of a mountain lodge that is going to the dogs, so they start calling in pest controllers, Julie's dad and his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She's not a little girl anymore, she's a growing young woman experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner, Beatriz Schamowitz (who is also the producer of the film), struggled with the pacing of the narrative in their previous dog film, which at least amused the children and dog.
This time, the creative duo has written a weaker script that triggers a mixture of awe and feelings of deceit.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, a scientist, succumbs in her yearning for a child to demonic delusions, and when the right constellation arises, she has sex with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates happen to be – in a car, or the church steeple (obviously during an excursion with the local guide), the retired colonel Mojmír shoots his own daughter (Julie), who falls into a coma, at which point she is taken away by the family to the hospital, so that the miraculous healing of the dog can take place in the heart of the Sumava mountains.
Nothing against cleaning up nature and strengthening animal mascots.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer quickly realises how much content packed with untrue situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves in the staff, a competition for pigeon fanciers, a charlatan from the Sudetes discussing the fertility-boosting properties of bone marrow with the police who have been called to look for "drugs" - and of course, a family in the pension who are obviously drunk.
When the heroine comes round from her hangover and sits slumped and ashamed at the dinner table with a cigarette, demanding her father's whisky and a bottle of wine as the cured vegetarian, you can't help but laugh.
The creators explain to the audience that "sometimes it takes a while".
Šajmovič's team is missing the basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build the foundations of a play, a sense of character and point of view, and directorial leadership.
Performances are uneven, editing is careless and the overall impression is of a film in search of an ending.
Although Lukas Vaculik, Jitka Jezkova and Nela Boudova try to save their parties, they don't have much to play with.
The only thing that remains from the film are the poetical shots of the Sumava nature by the camera man Vladimír Holomčík and the two deer.
It's not enough to sketch a few characters, draw a flimsy plot and pepper it with dog-related puns.
Neither is a lifetime membership in the Jezvcik Breeders' Club - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions in promoting nature and the friendship between man and dog, one must also have knowledge of the craft, wants to tell a believable story.
It did not succeed in this case.
There's a little too much eroticism and not enough wit for a good family film.
Even as an advertisement for cannibalism, that amateurish bit would have passed.
Yeah, respect, because they have to listen to a constant stream of nonsense exactly like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, and here you can see how it is understood, but it is just because you have never done it.
The decision is always the customer's, if he doesn't want to answer, the answer will always be no.
If you were to listen to such a kid, you might change your mind.
It's work like any other, a brigade on the side.
The Middle East is suffering unusually dry months.
Yet winter is the only season when it rains.
“Almost no rainfall during November, which we recorded at some stations, is unusual,” confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reported just six percent of its long-term average rainfall in November.
This week's two-day rain was more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't been quiet here for a long time.
It's also the right Christmas backdrop, Nazareth resident Wasím Aškar said.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in winter months, is abrupt and irregular.
Winter rains make forests dependent.
Without them, they are prone to fires.
It's not just forests that are at stake, but also drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this year in the spring thanks to three consecutive rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers have been warning of drought for months.
It is expected that with global warming and changes in climate, rainfall may decrease here, said Uri Schor, spokesman for the Israel Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel is able to help with technologies such as desalination or recycling of waste water.
It is worse for economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria or Jordan.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, the number of water tankers is increasing.
Water pipes and private wells, for example, dry up.
This year, my orders increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to two previous years, said Imád Sulejman, the driver of the tanker truck.
Clashes between farmers and security forces erupted in the Iranian city of Isfahan.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The local riverbed was completely dry.
The region has seen its driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military strike against Iran
Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman declared that the talks in Vienna had not brought about "any progress" and that he had informed Washington about the preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Defense Minister Benny Gantz declared on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reports.
Gantz, who lives in the United States, is trying to persuade Americans to step up pressure on Iran, but also informed Washington about military preparations.
At a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that nuclear talks in Vienna had not brought about "any progress" and world powers "realize the Iranians are playing a game with them."
This happened to me about 3 years ago.
I flirted a bit with Miss and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wants from me.
In the end, I found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
As I really don't like these kind of people, I shook her hand for a few seconds, asked her some questions and then thanked her and left.
Just tell me quietly that I was drunk, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
The skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, there was enough snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced their first major influx of skiers over the weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no need to worry about snow and some ski resorts have opened thanks to this.
The rally-goers were not deterred by the obligation to present a COVID-19 certificate at the checkpoints.
While tow companies aren't complaining about a lack of interest from customers, some ski rental shops report weaker demand for their services than before the outbreak.
Thousands of people ran in the countryside and on ski slopes at the weekend in Liberec region.
The weather was good for the skiers, who had sunshine and excellent snow conditions today.
We are happy that the opening weekend really worked out, from Thursday evening's skiing when we had the first skiers on the mountain, said the director of the Sporting Areas Ještěd, Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went to Jeseníky for the first weekend of skiing in the new season.
Ski Arena Karlov, for example, was opened.
Weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
Conditions are unfavorable.
Today the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, said Rostislav Procházka, a representative of the Branná ski resort.
Ski resort operators can sell skipasses only to people who are vaccinated or who have recovered from COVID-19.
People are generally prepared for this, with the exception of a few people, and they provide the necessary documentation, René Hroneš from the Spindlerův Mlýn ski centre told CTK.
We recorded only one incident, he added.
Lower demand than before the pandemic is reported by some rental companies and ski equipment shops.
The interest in renting skis is great.
It's not as many as in the past, but there are still customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
A greater influx is expected during the skiing holidays.
The manager of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, David Šinták, also feels that there is less demand for ski equipment rentals due to Covid.
At this time last year, we were almost ready for the pandemic.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, said ČTK Šinták.
According to him, people got used to the pandemic and learned to stay at home.
On the contrary, there is a big demand for loans in the Novako on Bozidar area.
Ski rental started there at the beginning of the week and those interested must now book them in advance.
Bikes will be available to borrow from this weekend, people have already been calling in advance so we are expecting a lot of interest, the same as last year, said the operator of the complex, Pavlína Nováková.
According to her, the interest is comparable to that before the epidemic, which is also for a ski school.
If we want successful and wealthy people not to leave the country, they must be able to live a quality life here as they would abroad.
This certainly does not apply to socialist healthcare, where it is often difficult to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
The clever and cunning people who have no assets abroad are leaving the country.
The owner of the company will not go abroad.
I completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the CR and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the CR, then they simply will not live in the CR.
The exodus from Hungary began when Orbán won one beautiful day, ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic can every day be in a similar position.
Another question is the elections.
If it's going to be quiet here, some traditional V4 nutcase will win.
The young and educated will leave, but his supporters and people whose property cannot fit into the aircraft will stay.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood over beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic autumn was in full swing, in Thailand the film's crew, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), enjoyed tropical weather!
In the meantime, the actor published a bloody photo of his face on social networks.
Is it a real injury or is it for the cameras?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech.
She was last seen on her way home.
The disappearance of Petra does not resemble her behavior at all and we are starting to get very concerned for her," said Lucy O'Connor, from Lambeth police's CID team, where Mrchová worked.
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work on Sunday 28th November at around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen in the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by someone from her colleagues on 3 December.
Srncová worked at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, according to British media.
We are deeply concerned about our colleague Petra, who is missing, said the group of healthcare facilities in a twitter post.
We want to encourage anyone who knows anything to come forward," the message continued.
MP Harriet Harman has also called on the public to help, at a press conference on Saturday.
She's been missing for a few days, she's 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably upset, said the Labour politician holding up a picture of the woman distributed by London police.
I feel like all of us have a special responsibility to try and find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family and working here for our health service, said Harmanová.
The police had previously detained one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the BBC's news website, however, the police have not provided any information about his identity or that of the man he is suspected of being.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (around 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
They are not "huge numbers," but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
We should remember that Ukraine constantly repeats that it is exaggerating the threat of an invasion and is starting to have its teeth bared at our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what he thinks Russia wants war for.
War is a costly luxury and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparing it to the situation in 38 is beyond so many points that I don't even know where to begin.
I can already compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily:D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced it would not abide by the Minsk agreements, Russia annexed those godforsaken countries.
That is how it is and that is what this "concentration" at the borders corresponds to.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables come into force in Prague from Sunday, affecting mainly suburban services
Passengers in Prague's integrated public transport (PID) can expect some changes from Sunday, which primarily affect suburban services.
New lines were created, some changed their route, and others disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is now being integrated into the system.
In the capital city, express trains from České Budějovice stop in the Zahradní Město station.
In the suburban train service, S7 trains will run which will pass through the Prague Main Station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will now stop at the recently opened station of Praha-Zahradní Město.
PID is now being extended to other areas.
In addition, buses will travel to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatná u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses on Mladoboleslavsky will be included, including those with services stretching into Liberec and Hradec Kralove regions.
Integration will result in the closure of 77 lines, the introduction of 37 new lines and changes to the operation of 12 existing lines.
From Zličín in Prague, a new bus route 405 will go as far as Žatec.
There is also a new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovník, which replaces the cancelled train S53.
Trains will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and on weekends, when the number 404 express train will be launched.
Newly included in the PID system are lines 400 and 410 running to Liberec region.
They leave from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nádraží Holešovice station.
Core route 400 runs via Mělník, Dubá and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor, with selected services continuing to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional route 410 runs from Mělník via Dubá to Doksy, Mimoně and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the contrary, dozens of regional lines in Central Bohemia have been cancelled or curtailed, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway there are long-term restrictions on the Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín lines.
Travellers can also expect changes at other locations.
Buses replace some of the cancelled train lines or extend the section of the 420 line from Dobříš with connections from Prague, where tickets can be used to Milevsko.
Trajectories of lines 540 to 543 on Nymburk have changed, and the routes of some buses on the border between Central Bohemia and Hořovicko in Plzeň Region have been altered.
Healthy lunch/dinner in the office from the supermarket
Hello, I work 9-5 with a 30-minute break, and my only option to get lunch is to walk next door to Billy or a bit further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, I don't have the strength to train after work, so I have to eat as healthily as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and I buy pizza at the speed of light - maximum cheese and tomato and salad and yoghurt and apple.
Question: What would you recommend for a healthy diet without the need for thermal processing in a supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a metre of snow like you, unfortunately.
It's not about trees you have to see.
Under the snow, only the tips of the trees are visible.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I don't think it's the only reason they ban us from going off piste but it's one of them.
Daria's confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't happy about it at all
The Czech showbiz fish pond died on Friday other than by revealing the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent fans an extensive message explaining why she kept her love for them a secret for so long.
I dare to say that currently there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would not feel embarrassed that Dara caught a bear, i.e. a pardon, a bear, says Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech football player up to his ears.
But he picked her up, not the other way around.
Three days are in the spotlight, and yet they are used to the interest of the public and are not happy about it.
And this is it.
We both weren't looking forward to that, but we knew it would happen eventually, continues the singer.
I don't even know who is worse off.
If you don't give a damn, and jump on them even from the preserve, or we, whose lives you dissect minutely.
As if someone would want to hear your opinion on whether you and your husband or partner are suited, or whether you're sticking to the fact that everyone should know your full list of ex-partners and be aware of your mistakes and flaws.
It's nothing, it's what you want, Dara.
The duo met up in Italy, where Rolins was travelling for the preparations of her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been working as the vice president of football club Juventus there for a long time.
With the truth finally out, they have come out now because they were waiting for the conclusion of Nedvěd's divorce.
He has been separated from his wife Ivana for three years, but they have only been divorced for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who are happy with us and wish us well, we thank you.
We are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
I love my new husband and like he is with me, I am with him. In good and in bad, Rolins concluded.
Hello, other commentators have probably already said everything that is significant, I am just confirming that the dorms are great to start with, my classmates usually meet and befriend each other during the first semester or two, and find roommates together, which is the best option for me as I know who I will be living with.
Most flats don't go on the market for a long time in advance, so you probably won't find what you're looking for now, but it won't do any harm to have a look at what's on offer.
Otherwise, for sure not only Cejlu will be burned, but also the surroundings (Vranovská, Francouzská streets, that's a bad enough address), and some parts of Židenice are a little ghetto.
On the contrary, the Veveří quarter is quite student-y, Královo pole and that way is great, besides that it is close to most faculties of VUT (I don't know where exactly you are going).
I have never been looking for a job, but I am a native Brňák, so I might be able to advise Brno as such, if you are still missing some information.
But it is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite okay that the state does not provide sufficient funding for some schools.
Either they learn what they want to learn and pay for it themselves, or they go according to the state and pay for it.
We cannot allow a private actor to take control of a piece of education just because it happens that with a few crowns he will be able to teach what he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when written by a person who two days ago expressed himself in such terms about the petition for a boycott of the totalitarian state:
So the voice for or against someone going for an abortion is the same as the voice for or against a statue being in the square?
I would have consulted with that person directly, the one who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced when cataloguing/digitising (even with long-time professionals) that it is either OK from the eye, or they write something like xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and a note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I would not recommend it.
I would have dealt with it personally in a note, according to what program you use.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look up some sign language databases and find the nearest one.
But because it looks like you're drawing from some book, I'd tip that the author or printer simply created their own mark, which sits alongside the physical thing.
PS: Is it not rather the Odra (kingdom) than OdraN?
PSS: Someone already told you here.
Laugh at this comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians do not know what the "topic" of our presidency will be.
This is much worse than the fact that they will have interpreters with them.
The idea that something might pass because no one understood the text is amusing.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, and this requires some basic knowledge of English, which lawyers have.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, and English is better suited for informal contacts and establishing overstandard relationships with politicians.
And with that Englishwoman, it's quite interesting after Brexit.
I can't stand the hate on the street.
I have been working there for the third year in a row and feel completely at ease.
I drive home from work every day at 10pm and have never had a problem.
Only someone who has almost never been there can say that it is a ghetto.
Jo, where most of the Roma population in Brno live, but the only thing they do is that they block the pavement and park wherever they want:D Definitely not that I would be scared to walk on the street there at night.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap accommodation with good access to the centre, I'd have no problem going there.
There are plenty of flats there now, newly reconstructed or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda and his lover Gelemová in the fence!
Who are you spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw the wreath and Lucie definitely has one too, said the saxophonist, confirming Patrasová's words that she often visits.
He visits, but does not live in their house on Vinohradek, where Dáda is left alone after his departure.
Slováček still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together!
But we still told each other something, so there was no Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy presents all the time, and I'm sure I'll buy Dad and Lucia something, probably perfume.
I am a gentleman, added Felix, who came up with the idea to have a music video made for the club Richman.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone to have fun with, says Slováček, who was glad to meet Luďka Sobotova's wife Adrian or singer Kamila Nývltová.
He made that quite clear.
And we are Iceland, so that we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us, and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot to take it.
I don't see why this should be a bad argument, so why don't you explain it to me?
I know of no other component that could be used in hospitals in a crisis.
There are few police officers and they cannot afford to do it, so the firefighters are there and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
The other is that our army is capable of defending the city of Ostrava as much as the previous governments, not the army, which has asked for new toys for too long.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside is not just a factory for food, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is experiencing its worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water levels have decreased in mountainous and sub-mountainous areas, and even places that did not suffer from a lack of water in the past are now doing so.
The drought, which is affecting much of central Europe, is being caused by climate change.
But the effects are reinforced by the way we farm the land.
What should we do in connection with the drought?
How can we help nature in difficult times?
If it's like that, I'll just about stay on my skates on the ice, I know what it takes to play hockey and that tactics (I've tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also overall crap.
If you're the hockey team "Russia's bear" or "China's sheep", you can lose by two goals even if you don't have to win the game at any cost.
But as it is, as I listen to the Czech commentators who are commenting, the referees don't seem to care whether it's male or female hockey, it's all very strange, but that's how it is with all sports, UEFA and the "Italian actors", Formula 1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
In my opinion, if it were the other way around, it would be like always, and that since the Czech Republic has lost more often to Russia than it has won, it would be a classic "they lost" vs "we won".
Coronavirus: Number of cases in Russia exceeds 1 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily cases.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the CR, with another 74.
There were 1967 confirmed cases per 100,000 in the CR in the last 14 days and 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of cases in Russia exceeded 1 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new cases have been recorded.
It's the lowest daily total since October 13.
The total number of registered cases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an "unavoidable" big wave of infections caused by Omikron, Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the UK's Health Protection Agency, said on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be required.
People infected with Omicron are already being hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
So far, no one has died from Omikron, but people are hospitalized about 14 days after exposure and about three weeks after exposure.
Labour's Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson had clearly broken the law by holding the event alone in December, when the lockdown was in place and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister in Johnson's government defended the quiz, saying it took place "virtually," through a computer.
However a group of staff gathered around computers in Downing Street.
Pressure is mounting in Britain for Johnson to step down as prime minister.
During last December's lockdown, when London was placed under strict quarantine and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous receptions despite the lockdown.
British public and media are outraged that Johnson and his government made a mockery of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial TV channel ITV for Britain: Two years ago today Boris Johnson won a crushing victory in the general election.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about removing him from the post of Prime Minister.
It's remarkable how quickly things developed.
Want to turn and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for elections in the spring that could bring an end to Viktor Orban's twelve-year rule.
They will be elections of European significance.
How much can you expect that they will be fair?
They will not be fair.
It is unlikely that they will be free, because the last two elections under Orbán have not been free either.
His party, Fidesz, controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit from it, and engages in other small or large tricks.
The last one is that everyone can choose for themselves in practice.
To enable Fidesz to haul in voters from the decided districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could win.
So I just repeat that there will be no ferries at all.
Do you think it will be the same as in 2014 and 2018?
Because the situation is significantly different.
It used to be about whether Fidesz would win, but now it's about how many seats and whether it will have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that the united opposition will get more votes and mandates.
It is a big surprise for Viktor Orban and his party.
Won't they try even harder to keep their power?
Yes, there are some signs that they are prepared to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently an audio recording of the speaker of parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, leaked to independent media, in which the heads of secret services interpret the opposition as a threat to national security.
What are these indications of a new approach that you are talking about?
Yes, that is one of those new things.
It all starts with language.
I've been bitten a lot, last time when I was 14, my mother doesn't have much patience, I don't have either, grandpa has been waiting for a long time, but then he gets really angry (just because of me).
At the same time, I was very irritable and I screamed like a little girl, to the extent that I was lying on the ground screaming and was completely blue, they must have taken me under the shower twice to calm me down.
Occasionally I was corrected, sometimes it was more of a case of not knowing.
Definitely, I also have a tendency to solve things violently, as a child I was quite a handful, now I at least try to fight my way out of something, and as the youngest I clamoured over my parents' hands (so as not to get smacked), so I've never done anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I am not able to determine to what extent this is my own explosiveness, but it certainly has its part to play in this education.
I'm scared I'll lose my patience with the kids and deal with it the same way.
I think having children is simply bad and that my parents did not have to do it, especially not at that very moment when it was no longer "educational" but out of frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent something simply snapped, perhaps it is not possible to blame their children at least a little, so that they do not accuse them.
I don't see why OP should be ashamed of it.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would therefore call those who create laws in such quality.
Otherwise, would you be worried about a drop in income?
Can you really count on the fact that people will want your product, buy it and you'll be able to pay back the loan with interest?
Kočner's world of illusions.
Where is Slovakia moving the process of the murder of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins in the case of four defendants charged with the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner has changed Slovakia.
It boosted civil society, but it also uncovered the practices of businessman Marian Kočner, who was accused, and his links with the top of Slovakian politics and justice.
What will the basic breakthrough mean for Slovakia?
For this, journalists can be grateful.
How is it possible that this petition has had orders of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which was released the day after?
Once upon a time, they let themselves go and the company profited from it.

The next government ends and the law on involving municipalities in selecting a storage site nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is coming to an end and the law that was supposed to ensure the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected when selecting and permitting deep geological repositories for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The government's legislative council suspended discussions of the draft, which the Ministry of Industry and Trade submitted to the government after long delays.
However, its content is in conflict not only with the affected municipalities united in the Platform against the deep geological repository, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-government expects a significant strengthening of their options for decision-making on the storage facility, which is what the mayors have been promised since 2011, when the first works on this legislation began and which is also required by the Czech Atomic Energy Act and the European Directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The proposed law, drafted by Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform, is criticized above all by the municipalities: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process about selecting the location for a storage site is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
Actually, it can be quite effective only if the municipality or the public can influence whether the process will continue in that location at all.
It is possible to ensure compliance with the obligation to obtain the approval of the Storage Authority by depositing the obligation to obtain the consent of the affected municipalities prior to the commencement of specific proceedings.
The proposed draft resolution on the subject matter almost completely disregards the involvement of the public and turns citizens of the municipalities into almost mere spectators in the approval process.
The proposal lacks system settings for compensation for the whole process of searching for and selecting the location for the storage, its approval and operation.
Representatives of municipalities in practice according to current legal regulations have little opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a place for a landfill.
Only in some licensing procedures may submit their remarks or appeal, but the authority or the minister decides whether to issue the license.
Any potential lawsuits will not delay the implementation of exploratory or construction works.
Spolurozhodování samospráv, which the Platform asks for, is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries and certainly in those that have progressed in the licensing of data centres, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is in addition to another failure of the state administration, which outsources the preparation of legislation to external legal firms.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS, s.r.o., which SÚRAO concluded and which follows on from contracts with lawyer Jan Zemanek.
According to the register of contracts, the total sum for these works amounts to almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek location and spokesman for the Platform against the deep geological repository of the rivers, said: After the ministers for industry, who postponed the reorganisation of local authorities' status in relation to state authorities in the search for a deep geological repository for highly radioactive waste, we are expecting a clear turnaround from the new government.
We are also offering a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Association of Cities and Municipalities, which sees the problem of insufficient rights for municipalities in such a fundamental building in the same way as directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The platform against deep geological storage brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) with the aim of promoting a change in the state's approach to dealing with burnt nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep geological storage.
The platform also advocates that the decision on selecting the location for possible storage be conditional upon the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
Herce Johna Goodmana (69) helped to overcome fear: He lifted 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, doctors finally scared him into it.
They told him he would die if he didn't lose weight.
It took a while.
Goodman gradually shed 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kg, The Sun reports.
He showed off his new character at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles.
The guy from the sitcom Roseanne is completely different!
John often joked that his friends and family kept asking him to lose weight because his big frame was breaking their furniture.
I bit my tongue," he said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Travel, train.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit down, said Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on which boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it's someone's text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was, for example, a formal text or a university text, I would look for a way to describe or explain it better.
There are many types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls has several bosses, you fight them, and then there's the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super bosses), who aren't necessary to beat at all in order to finish the game or level, but are often much stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player doesn't fight them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and how do you even call them?
And then there are the mini bosses.
There is no word-for-word translation of boss into any language, including Czech, and other languages do not deal with it (interestingly, Catalan translates boss as final opponent).
In short, it's a story or game element that's generally significant, computer-controlled, stronger than all previous enemies, and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The world is searching for missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
British police have been looking for missing Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police also joined the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko is being sought from 7 December.
Through Interpol, it also helps the British police.
Czech Petra Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police are looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice for him.
After Petra, the whole world is looking for her.
The Czech police closely cooperates with the British police, confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
We share information on the case, she added.
The announced search for Petr has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimetres tall, plump, has brown eyes and long, straight hair the same colour.
She comes from Uherskohradišťsko.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her
The search for Petra also involved local MP Harriet Harman.
She participated in putting up posters with Petra's face on them.
We have huge concerns about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the decrease, the British police have arrested one suspect.
It is not clear, however, who is being referred to and what they had in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While October data showed a slight decrease in offensive campaigns, attacks increased significantly in the last month of the year.
We saw a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on 18 November.
The attacks are deliberately targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
An infected attachment in an email can catch the user's attention with the name, which refers to payments and financial transactions.
Last month, the dangerous attachment had the word "factura" in its name, but this time it was called "Copy of the invoice for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains functions that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively seeks out stored login details, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the end of August and early September, with the holidays and the end of the year approaching, the activity of attackers is growing again.
In November, spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic and security specialists caught more global campaigns in November.
Compared to the figures from October, the Formbook showed a slight weakening in November, but it is still close to a fifth of all detections.
The attacks were continuous throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The most common attachment was a .exe file called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account continues to appear.
The attachment in Czech can then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
There has been a significant fall-off and a weakening of activity, security analysts say of the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not seen a major campaign of attacks in the Czech Republic for several months.
Today's demo from the smart kids who don't need oxygen because they're vaccinated.
The Prague parade was bigger than the media reported.
According to the pictures from the procession along the embankment and my experience, I would not be afraid to estimate the number of demonstrators at around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite quay.
It means there are a lot of people.
About 4,000 demonstrators are taking part in the march, which is being spontaneously joined by an unprecedented number of passers-by.
I believe that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That long-standing dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population has led them to find common ground.
Even the mere antivaxers, antirouters and the like could not fill and pay for such a big procession.
The action of the association Chcípl pes is gaining increasing popularity, reminding me of the Million Chvilek pro demokracii.
Sometimes I have the impression that they rent the same podium and technology.
It's hard to say what movement you could appease with this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the flow of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer becomes a quadruple and multiple-dose vaccine.
Definitely not a left-wing or centrist movement, that's for sure.
The trivalent vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to wait half a year for everyone.
I am very glad that the vaccine saved us.
A genius move by scientists, for which humanity should be proud.
End of an era as Bulgaria gets new prime minister promising change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev entrusted the formation of a new government to Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption Movement for the Change, which won the November elections.
He has now managed to put together a broad coalition that should take office within a few days.
Political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
But the victorious parties, who had fought against corruption and abuse of power, failed to reach an agreement, so there were two early elections.
What do cats do when nobody is looking?
The global hit comes from "secretly" shot footage.
Over the weekend, fears grew for the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman, who London police have been looking for for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
Besides calling the police, her former employer or a Member of Parliament representing the part of London where she lived are also being contacted.
The disappearance of Petra does not resemble her behavior at all and we are starting to get very concerned for her," said Lucy O'Connor, from Lambeth police's CID team, where Mrchová worked.
Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman left work on Sunday 28th November at around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell area.
She was last seen in the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by someone from her colleagues on 3 December.
Srncová worked at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, according to British media.
We are deeply concerned about our colleague Petra, who is missing, said the group of healthcare facilities in a twitter post.
We want to encourage anyone who knows anything to come forward," the message continued.
The amateur painter of children's rooms, Zdenku Dvorakova Kocourkova from Sumperk, was denounced anonymously for violating copyright with her paintings.
However, the court acknowledged that Krtečka's paintings in the Sumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, a month-long hole in the road appeared in the form of a canal without a roof.
It was his life.
The municipality referred the complaints to the RSD, which owns the road, but it did not respond, so the hole just got bigger.
In the end, the authorities clarified responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the ŘSD "began to intensively address the situation."
