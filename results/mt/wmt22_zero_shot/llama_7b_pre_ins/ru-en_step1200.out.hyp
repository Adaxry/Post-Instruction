From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balsamo's age based on their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkovsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very same Balzacian ladies of a certain age.
And the psychology and torment of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenyev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, it's very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige mattress 105x195.
The "Micropack Prestige" model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress features different levels of firmness on each side: the medium-firm side is made of latex foam and organic latex, the medium side - of organic latex foam.
A spring block with 1,000 springs per square metre quickly adapts to the shape of a sleeping body, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "gamma" effect.
Among the advantages of the model are breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for breathability, naturally ventilates like a coconut shell.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate is maintained in the bedroom.
The warranty period is also extended to the mattress.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, but the mattress will last longer in practice.
Dust and contamination protection is provided by a detachable cover made from Jacquard, which is included in the package.
Buy a pair of orthopaedic pillows to put under your mattress - they're recommended for supporting optimal spinal alignment while you sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as an anatomical support for the spine, latex relaxes muscles.

So no support.
I remember these feasts and guests in the house of my parents with horror.
Guests are at the door, and patties are frying on the stove, and Mom is sitting up in bed, nursing the baby.
Lord, I can't even get up from the table.
And then take the dishes out, and clear the house.
You pull out all the products a week before the holiday, display them for two days, and clean up the next day.
And what about the guests?
They are fine, and a cake is obligatory.
I don't like holidays and guests since then.
I even cover the table for my family.
And I make them a lot, I just bake them a lot.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccination is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination campaign in Germany will not be the last, but will continue with renewed vigour.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are unlikely to be enough for full protection.
This is what the head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigel, believes.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11.
We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, the latest in autumn, - the expert believes.
In addition, Wiegelt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with the flu vaccination".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, intensified vaccination may help fight the spread of the new "Omicron" strain of the coronavirus.
And the new version is particularly dangerous.
For example, the probability of a repeat infection with "Omicron" is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech / Pfizer plans to provide an adapted vaccine for Omikron by March 2022.
Companies point out that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of coronavirus "Omicron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that the efficacy of two doses of the vaccine was significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain, BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
So a third dose is required.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the President of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Zaizberger, advocates reducing the interval between the second and third vaccination.
In addition, as Salzberger sees it, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both Delta and Omicron variants of the coronavirus.
The experience of Israel is very impressive in this regard, the expert stressed.
Pontoon21 vibrator, Bet-A Vib, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from the Pontoon21Â® company.
It (like the series Kalikana Vib) differs from the majority of other vibes in that it was conceived with the use of underwater fishing in mind, not just casting.
These vibrations have a higher specific weight than that of close analogues by size, which certainly has a positive effect on the nuances of applying these interesting supplements.
Another recognizable feature is the top fin, made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional tones of vibration when swimming vertically and horizontally.
As an "icebreaker", the Bet-A-Vib demonstrates quite aggressive game.
Often the most effective is simple monotonous animation, that is, movements of the whipper-in up and down almost without pauses.
When planning the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, kelp and other obstacles that can snag.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant for catching winter suckers and large perch, and especially in the middle of winter, when precise and aggressive presentation of the bait is required.
Reaching the end of its trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly rotates and returns to its original vertical position.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for ice fishing for perch.
To please her caprices, you can choose between two versions: with a noise-cancelling capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without one (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib lure is capable of irritating the passive perch, which does not even react to live bait.
With the throw Bet-A-Vib demonstrates its range and accuracy.
This embroidery is understandable and not capricious, it combines well with lace and braided cords, even of large diameter.
When fishing for perch, ruffe, bream or pike, a "staircase" or "staircase" method is used, sometimes with "tickling" the bottom.
If you catch in snagged areas, you can switch to a double instead of a treble, reducing the chance of getting snagged.
Among the primaries of its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most resistant to work and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
It can be used with equal success on both relatively small and fairly deep-lying areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young layabouts are sitting on their parents' necks.

In Libya, it was reported about 7,000 Russian mercenaries
In Libya, there are over 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagner".
This was announced on Sunday, December 12, by the chairman of the Higher State Council of the republic, Haid al-Mishri.
There are currently over 7,000 mercenaries from the "Wagner" private military company in Libya.
They have aircraft too.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 fighter jets at the Ghardabiya air base (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," he said, according to the Anadolu agency.
Halid al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "bringing their man to power" in Central African Republic.
Keep a presence
According to the source, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "moved" to Libya.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an air base and port in Sirte, as well as an air base in Jufra, according to the publication.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner group has the Kremlin's support.
Where else can mercenaries be hired?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is operating in nine countries in Africa - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal security for leaders, and protection for energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, "Vagner" subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use natural resources and raw materials as well as to supply weapons, technologies and military services to these countries," the article says.
According to media reports, the Wagner group is said to have fought in eastern Ukraine, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed in the security services, nor in the registry of legal entities, and its fighters do not exist in the lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
We remind you that the presidents of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against "Vagener" earlier.
It is expected that the Council of the European Union will approve this decision on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The High State Council of Libya de facto is the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions, dominated by Islamists, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single day of voting for parliamentary and presidential elections at least until February 2022.
There are now less than two weeks before the election and the chances of it happening on time are rapidly diminishing, the report says.
In this context, the High Election Commission of Libya has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period, Sky News Arabia reports.
Russian Foreign Policy through Russian Eyes
38% of Russians see more success than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% think failures prevail.
Examples of success - "in Syria, we defended and restored peace there", "the decision on the Nord Stream-2", "we scared the whole world with serious weapons", "Crimea is ours".
The main failures are the "conflict with Ukraine," "confrontation with Western countries," and "isolation from the world," - says the study by the "Public Opinion" Foundation.
Dubai's government has fully switched to paperless procedures - all government services have become digital as well
The Dubai government announced a complete switch from paper-based processes to digital technology.
All state services will also be provided to citizens exclusively in electronic form.
This was reported by the UAE news agency WAM.
Today's day marks the beginning of a new stage of digitalization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, on Saturday.
Now all internal and external document circulation in all Dubai government entities will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation has affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing, police, municipal authorities, courts and so on. Many commercial structures have also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to electronic government and digitization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, as authorities calculated, 33.6 million sheets of paper were saved, which is 1.4 million hours of human labor and $35.38 million in monetary equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens two days a year.
Yesterday, yes, about the dates of birth and how many years the child has, this is already a cliche, about the class and group in the kindergarten too.
I don't believe such nonsense is possible.
And if there are, they are obviously all over it, including the family.

These people knew exactly that there was someone at home...
Turkey's car production and exports fall below 2020 levels
Car production and exports from Turkey fell sharply in November as the lira depreciated.
As a result, the industry's performance over the 11 months was worse than the previous year's result, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the Association of Automotive Manufacturers in Turkey.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were released from the factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year ago.
Some 75,9 thousand machines were sent for export, which is more than 25% lower than the year before.
And if the automotive sector in Turkey showed positive dynamics compared to the previous year in the first 10 months of this year, then in the 11 months of 2021, the release of cars was already 0.3% lower than the previous year.
The reason for such a fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a fall in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 subjects of the MSB received a postponement of credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailyov told reporters about the situation with providing benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports correspondent MIA "Kazinform".
âAccording to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of Financial Markets, in the current year, on April 9, 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued the Order #127 âOn Approving the Order of Providing a Deferral of Payments for Loans by Subjects of Small and Medium Businessâ, - Alihan Smailov wrote in his response to the parliamentary inquiry.
He reminded that the order of providing a moratorium on payments on loans envisaged that banks and organizations carrying out microfinance activities were to provide IPs with a moratorium on payments on loans issued by MSB subjects up to April 1, 2021, from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The term of deferral ranged from 30 to 90 days and was chosen by the subject of MSB.
The borrower may indicate another due date for repayment in the statement.
During the period of the moratorium on the borrower, the collection of claims and lawsuits, notification of the need to repay the overdue debt, as well as the collection by the creditor of commissions and other payments were suspended, - the deputy prime minister noted.
For 2021, applications for a deferral of loan repayments were received from 603 borrowers-subjects of the MSB, of which 553 subjects of the MSB received a deferral of repayment on a sum of 9.7 billion tenge.
In the MFO, 131 subjects of the MSB applied for a postponement, of which a postponement was granted to 95 subjects for a total of 105.8 million tenge," - concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Pushasev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily carry the "okmion" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems could tolerate it better than those with strong immune systems
Pulmonologist Sergey Pushasev explained why the coronavirus "OKMIRON" strain could be dangerous.
The reason lies in the conditions of the virus's emergence.
Scientists believe that "okmioni" originated in the bodies of infected with HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
In other words, he did not encounter any resistance from the immune system.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no answer from the immune system, it became very fast.
It is likely that there are these spike proteins, thorns, maybe more than usual, their antibodies did not cut during mutations - commented on pulmonologist Sergey Pushasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may tolerate "Okmiro" better than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response by the body to anything, to any infection, is not always a good thing.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when the young 30-year-olds die and the old 60-year-olds die of tuberculosis.
The immune response of a young person is excessive: there, where you could only threaten with a finger, he beats like a gunshot at sparrows - concluded Sergey Pushasev.
The doctor also reminded that coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most dangerous of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to control only the symptoms - and all hopes are on the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this is fever, weakness, illness.
Then come respiratory symptoms: difficult breathing, cough in the throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left, and abdominal pain can also be a sign of a developing problem.
In the meantime, in Russia, the new generation from 12 to 18 years old may be vaccinated.
Virologist and head of the laboratory of genetic engineering at MFTI Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from covid.
The maximum number of contacts is with schoolchildren.
This is the most socially active layer, like kindergarten children - said "Moskva 24" Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the laboratory of genetic engineering at MFTI.

Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of COVID-19
The researchers studied fat tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected with the coronavirus.
Fat tissue-resident immune cells, macrophages, also became infected, showing strong inflammatory reactions.
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding different organs.
It is known that HIV and the flu can hide in fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir to evade the immune system.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 can do the same.
Biologist told about the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golochekin named the reasons for the emergence of dementia and told about the ways of its prevention in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - with time, the person finds it difficult to orient even in a familiar environment.
Goloshchikov noted that the most common cause of dementia is neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, some infections, metabolic disorders, and vitamin deficiency.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity can play a role," he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by harmful habits - smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, disorders of sleep and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a reduction in abstract thinking.
A discussion is underway that hearing loss can be both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its emergence, the biologist added.
To prevent the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities requiring memory and logic.
Previously, professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics FGANIMU named after.
N.I. Pyrogova, head of the department of cognitive disorders at the Federal Center of the Brain and Neurotechnologies, Anna Bogolepova, explained the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30,000 illegally exported artefacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to repatriate around 30,000 artefacts that were illegally exported out of the country through the black market.
This was announced by the head inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities at the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities in Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad, on Saturday, December 11.
Since 2011, Egypt has recovered 29,300 artefacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization have been discovered in the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gauad added that all the artefacts smuggled out were registered in the archives.
Currently, department staff are working on their return to Egypt.
Specifically, experts "track auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The main inspector told how cultural values are restored upon return, and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the artefacts returned was a ancient human skeleton found in Belgium that is now part of the exhibition at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
The auction house Christie's held a sale on July 4, at which a bust dating back more than 3,000 years was sold for $5.97 million (around 68 million rubles).
This caused displeasure in Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artefact was illegally removed from the Carnarvon Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the god of the sun Amun, has been in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is not known.
Egypt in recent years has been actively seeking the repatriation of ancient monuments illegally removed from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of the contraband antiquities are the result of "black diggers" archaeological excavations.
Crimean Tatars are not taken into account (there are 232,000 of them) because they are a separate people (close to Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42,000 people - that's how many Tatars (from Kazan) live in Crimea (according to the census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this nation consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse is asking its staff for access to their personal mobile devices, Financial Times writes.
The point is that in Europe and the US, Swiss banks do not issue their staff with corporate devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, a bank can monitor information on corporate devices issued to its staff as they are used for business purposes with colleagues or clients.
The bank reserves the right to check mobile devices in exceptional cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many staff have moved to remote working, the bank now wants to extend the rule to all devices used for work.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline for employees to become familiar with the new rule.
Credit Suisse is not commenting on the new requirement officially.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Esenin's life - 1925 - was a fruitful one in terms of his creativity, but a difficult one for the poet and his "ego".
He is not in any literary union, he spilled with imaginism, he is himself, but he is known, in demand, sometimes rudely criticised by critics, even maliciously, but the reading public is ready to carry it for him.
More than 60 poems were written in a year, many of them are true masterpieces, the cycle of "Persian motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Soviet Russia".
And the main success - in late June, Gosizdat concluded a contract with Esenin to publish his works in three volumes.
No contemporary of Sergei Aleksandrovich was awarded such a honor, he was the first!
Moreover, it promised very good money - the fee was 1000 roubles a month for 20 months (the director of the factory, for example, received 300 roubles a month, an engineer - 200).
The funds were needed as never before.
Esenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofia Tolstaya, and had to arrange a family life, support his sisters Katya and Sasha, and their mother.
It seems life is getting back to normal, there is something to be happy about, but everything is colored in dark tones, as if the nightmare of the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) had materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is the wind blowing?
Over the empty and desolate field,
Just like the grass in September,
Alcohol dulls the brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin looked very bad, obviously ill.
There are more and more outbursts, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason, probably, is not only in alcoholism...
In any case, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was put to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, to May 1923, when Esenin was improving his health at the clinic run by Professor Petr Gannushkin in Paris at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan.
And here are the poet's drunken antics, scandals on this very topic, calls to the police - enough to fill dozens of memoirs.
The terrible romance of the poet with the green snake developed rapidly from the beginning of the 20s.
In late summer 1923, Efimov moved in with his friend, imaginist Ivan Starcev.
Surprisingly, but despite his very good incomes, Yessenin never had his own housing in Moscow or in Piter, he rented rooms, stayed in hotels or with acquaintances.
Starchenko remembers:
He only came to sleep, and in the majority of cases in an incomprehensible, drunk state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Esenin fell on the staircase...
Falling, he scraped his face and whimpered.
When he came to, he started coughing up blood uncontrollably..."
And even Esenin, after his trip around Europe and in the USA (at that time there was a dry law in the States, but Duncan took with her a decent amount of spirits), admitted:
I saw nothing there but cabarets and streets...
I've already forgotten most of the people...
Well, and drank, of course...
I drank because I was lonely."

Now his son is almost 16, and he has long been free of the desire to provoke.
All his energy is focused on choosing what he will do to make a living.
He's much more responsible than I was at his age, or my husband, who had periodic run-ins with the law until the wedding.
The father takes care of his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strange love."
Why did the girl cry on the exam when she hadn't even failed it?
Why he didn't tell his daughter it wasn't a school.
She'll have a tail.
So what?
Pass it on.
Millions of students know this.

Polish MFA considers Belarus uses migrants as "weapon" against the EU
Polish MFA considers Belarus uses migrants as "weapons"
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel JabÅoÅski expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used the refugees as "a weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus have "temporarily stopped Lukashenko," but he is "actively looking for new paths."
The Polish official also believes that illegal immigrants will now be used as a weapon "in many points of the world."
As the KP.ru website wrote, earlier the European Union introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 physical persons and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they announced their readiness to expand restrictive measures against the republic "if the situation in the country does not improve."
In response, Minsk introduced a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had earlier decided to introduce sanctions against Belarus.

âNot a Senke hatâ: when a baroque coat turns a man into a laughingstock
At the 2021 world events, baroque coats were dominant.
Perhaps the first was Daniel Craig.
In September, at the premiere of the film "Not Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet burgundy jacket and a traditional "Bond Girl" bow.
Prince William has followed in his father's footsteps twice, first wearing an inappropriate green velvet jacket for an environmental award ceremony, The Earthshot Prize, and then opting for a more traditional look for a charity event supporting the Royal Variety.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was set by Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to pick up his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo.
By the way, his sons were dressed the same.
AliExpress has already noticed a growing demand for silk men's jackets in Russia.
According to the service's analysts, cited by "Gazeta.Ru", their sales increased by 1.4 times.
The most popular are warm velvet blazers with padding and a fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, brown, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - complete sets of velvet suits they choose less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
There are budget options at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, this season's suits are presented in almost all brands - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most coveted is the Gucci model, which was worn by one of the ambassadors of the brand, Jared Leto, at one of the premieres of the film "Gucci House."
Choosing jackets from expensive brands means you can be sure the velvet is made from silk.
Thanks to a special technology of interlacing threads, a dense fabric with a wavy external texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but they serve for less time.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhshin warns that in the case of a silk jacket, the main thing is not its model or cut, but appropriateness.
A velvet jacket requires evening light so it's ideal if you're going to a party or a formal event - explains Vakhshin. - It'll work even if the invitation says "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion that allows to make a choice in favor of a baroque jacket is the status of its buyer.
A man in a pinstriped suit, first and foremost, needs to acquire a proper, well-fitting wardrobe with enough, - consider the authors of the Telegram-channel "Handsome Brammell". - Owners of pinstriped suits, as a rule, belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to the themed events, where the dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhshin suggests combining a velvet jacket with such elegant items as classic trousers with braid, a one-colour shirt, silk socks, cravats, lace-up shoes, and garters.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Brammell's Beauty" are sure: inappropriate would be the appearance of a plain-clothes officer in a baroque jacket at a corporation, but if we are talking about a "manager among those who run this event, then - "yes," such a thing is appropriate for him.
If you're a subordinate by rank and your goal is to move up in a complex corporate hierarchy or score a financial bonus, it's best not to wear a pinstriped suit.
The management will definitely assess this phrase with the words "not like Senske", - the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion think.
Very mixed feelings about the voice.
It's an unnatural tone, so tired.
And it has nothing to do with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you success in life!
It all comes down to money - alternative energy is well lobbied for, which means it is paid for.
Billions of investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy is not in short supply either - gas, oil and coal were cheaper to buy than they are now.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
The sparrow is dripping.
And who is passing by?
As usual - a regular buyer.
Does the plight of the Indians bother the sheriff?
So it is wrong to think of Western politicians as fools, "sleeping through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good mind.
I didn't see any beautiful people in the pictures.
Just mediocrity within the statistical average of passengers.
Maybe if such characters are so sure of their beauty that they decide to show it off on the whole train, they will not be approached by such people.
But only due to psychological disorder and ignorance of such "beauties (-ies)" but not because of their appearance.

An immunologist said that revaccination after 4-5 months would help protect against the "omicron" strain of the coronavirus.
Revaccination after four to five months may protect against the new 'omicron' strain of coronavirus infection.
That's what immunologist Nikolai Kruglov said, calling the six-month waiting period, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "very long"
Previously, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure after five months, and people with chronic diseases - after four, " said the expert, calling for people to be revaccinated at the same time as the mass vaccination campaign.
Kruchkov also noted that an early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or has had the illness and been vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and gotten sick, they have a "hybrid immunity," or antibodies that are high enough to neutralize the virus, - the expert explained.
The "Big Seven" warned Russia of "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The countries of the "Big Seven" (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) published a statement on the results of the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that "military aggression" of Russia against Ukraine will have "enormous consequences and will cost Moscow dearly," but specific measures are not described in the document.
We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine, - the statement reads.
Next, the ministers call on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and respect its international commitments to transparent military activities," which President Trump said during a video call with President Putin on December 7.
We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format for the full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the foreign ministers of the "Big Seven" also stated.
The use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious cost in response," they warn.
We confirm our unshakeable commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation in our common and comprehensive response," the statement also says.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss said that Russia would face "serious consequences" if it were to invade Ukraine.
According to her words, this meeting showed "a united voice of the countries of the Big Seven, which accounts for 50% of the world's GDP, and which has made it quite clear that an invasion of Ukraine will have catastrophic consequences for Russia."
Pfizer vaccine deemed 32 times less effective than Omicron strain
The efficacy of Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine against the Omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology came to this conclusion, South China Morning Post (SCMP) reports.
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug against COVID-19.
We see that most people had high levels of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 strain, but that ability was significantly reduced against the Omicron strain,' Professor Malik Peiris explained.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against a severe course of the disease with a coronavirus infection.
Previously, researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the influence of the Omicron strain.
The study authors concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and an increase in deaths if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense accused Germany of blocking the supply of weapons from NATO to Kiev
Ukrainian Defense Minister, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the purchase of lethal weapons for Kiev as part of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times newspaper on December 12, Reschetnikov recalled that in the previous month Germany had vetoed the purchase by Ukraine of anti-sniper systems and rifles for shooting down drones.
However, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to acquire the mentioned weaponry within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, it is about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the new German government, under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, has yet to clarify its position on arms supplies to Ukraine.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect weapons deliveries from Berlin while Chancellor Scholz is in office.
According to him, the previous German government explained its refusal to supply weapons by the risk of an escalation of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, despite "the occupation of Crimea by Russia".
The diplomat is confident that Germany will keep to this "illogical" position, even with a new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said Kiev was expecting help from Berlin in equipping its naval fleet.
Ukraine expects Germany to be its "technical partner," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

G7 warns Russia of responsibility for invasion of Ukraine
The foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continued its military aggression against Ukraine, as stated in the final declaration of the parties.
Participants in the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of Russian armed forces on the borders of the country.
There should be no doubt in Russia that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs, the statement says, published on the website of the British government.
The foreign ministers of the G7 countries and the EU's chief representative noted that "they are united in their condemnation of Russian military aggression and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine."
British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it invaded Ukraine at a press conference in Liverpool.
We have made it clear that any incursion will have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to give up aggression against Ukraine," she said (quoted by TASS).
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, the G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis caused by the increase of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
The speech was about negotiations in the "Normandy format".
The North Atlantic Alliance also supported the dialogue on Ukraine in the "Normandy format".
Russian Foreign Ministry representative Maria Zakharova said that, by calling for Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "disappeared from their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes."

Ways to return stolen money through online stores revealed
There are several ways to get your money back from online stores that have stolen it, and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
This was revealed by experts in information security in an interview with RBC.
For example, to reduce the risk of major losses from falling into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account, which are not used for online shopping.
Some of the savings can be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend keeping a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen during purchases in stores not using the 3D Secure security technology, you can initiate a return of funds.
In accordance with the rules established by the payment systems, liability for unauthorized transactions, carried out without the use of 3D Secure, is borne by the participant in the chain of payments who does not use this service, - explained the representative of Promsvyazbank.
Arthur Zaremba, an expert from international payment service provider Ecommpay, stressed that the buyer has the right to lodge a complaint with the bank for disputing the fraudulent operation no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the criminal used a card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be contested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores return the money to the client if the order has not yet been sent to delivery.
On November 19, member of the Public Chamber, Director of the League for Safe Internet, Ekaterina Miropolina, reported that in 2021 alone there were 11,000 complaints about various cases of fraud: from selling fake documents to stealing personal data.
In her opinion, an effective solution to the current situation may be the creation of a single window for complaints against online scammers.
Scholz arrived in Poland for talks on "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis over migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judicial system in Poland, the buildup of Russian forces near Ukraine's borders and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream-2".
Although Scholz had expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for the long term, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would call on Scholz to oppose the "Nord Stream 2" project, under which Russian gas is to be delivered to Germany via Ukraine.
According to Moravetzky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a tool of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve the crisis.
However, Poland's judicial system remains a source of disagreement.
The European Court fined Poland for violating EU law by carrying out judicial reforms pushed through by the right-wing "Law and Justice" party.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its Supreme Court ruled that national law has priority over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not take on public commitments to stop the "Nord Stream 2" project in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany that the pipeline would be halted if Russia invaded Ukraine, a senior congressional staff member said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of consequences if Russia were to violate Ukraine's border, and that position was echoed by "Group of Seven" representatives on Sunday.
Dmitry, look closer.
The view out the window is the same, the size of the window hasn't changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the living room has been removed so you can see the second window from the kitchen.
And generally, those who are not familiar with the initial planning are skeptical.
And I know such flats very well and I can see very well how it was replanned.
I wish them all the best.
It always surprises me when people write in about cleaning aids for shells, toilets, skirting boards and cranes.
You see them once a year at Easter, aren't you? I mean, you have to wash them.
Just don't pollute.

Doctors warned of the dangers of long-term use of blood-thinning drugs after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Iryna Yarceva and Sergey Tokarev warned about the danger of uncontrolled use of blood-thinning drugs after being infected with the coronavirus Covid-19 and before being vaccinated against the coronavirus.

The doctor will prescribe anticoagulants (blood-thinning medication that prevents excessive clotting) if necessary.
She said that at the moment there was hysteria - everyone was drinking anticoagulants for a long time and getting complications in the form of haemorrhagic strokes (blood in the brain).
The chief prophylactic doctor of the Ural Federal District, scientific director of the Society of Specialists in Prophylactic Medicine, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev told URA.RU in an interview that Russians are currently using anticoagulants disorderly and before being vaccinated against the coronavirus infection.
According to Dr Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the internet and start to treat themselves.
There are such citizens who start taking anti-coagulants on their own decision a week before vaccination.
And before the vaccination doctors noticed bleeding.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without finding out the cause of any symptom.

Thief who found money in church wall to be paid $20,000
The plumber who found the money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be rewarded.
This is according to a press release by the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred at the Lakewood Church in Houston, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches that faithful Christians will prosper financially.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cullie was called to repair one of the church's toilets and found thousands of bundles of cash and cheques beneath the insulation.
He handed the find over to the church, he says, and did not even receive thanks from Austin.
I wanted to hear him say: 'You did the right thing, Justin.
We know what you've done and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
It is believed the find is linked to a theft that took place at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
That's when about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks went missing from the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of 25,000 dollars was announced for information about the perpetrators.
Justin Coyle couldn't claim the money as the deadline for the award had passed.
Despite that, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time put up a $5,000 reward and later received an additional $20,000 from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Osteen about the money found in the wall of the Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic as a real person.
That's why there is such a negative attitude to her.
And it's not because "she's financially much better off than all the other writers," as it says here.
There are people richer, but not everyone behaves so arrogantly, so provocatively as this madam.

In Brazil, citizens are required to present a vaccination passport upon entering the country
In Brazil, people entering the country are now required to show a Covid-19 passport, a decision made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens, who have contraindications to vaccination, are exempted from presenting the certificate of vaccination.
The list also includes people who have arrived from countries where there is no evidence of vaccination.
The situation is even more serious if you consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-Carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events that involve an increase in the flow of tourists," said Barroso.
Earlier authorities in Brazil required unvaccinated tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.

Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, and Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Alchevsky revealed the scheme for full protection from the coronavirus infection in an interview with Ura.ru.
He said this could be achieved by introducing injections and using nasal vaccine.
When given intramuscularly, antibodies A are formed in large quantities. When the vaccine is introduced by injection, this does not happen.
Antibodies A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot get into the body.
And after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulin G (antibodies).
And if you get both vaccines, you get lots of antibodies A and G. But there's no decision yet on double vaccination," the doctor said.
The main prophylacticist of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in his turn, stated that the main advantage of the joint use of nasal vaccination and injection vaccination is the possibility to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help as in such a case the body's defence should be maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Guseynov, said that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children would lead to a new outbreak of COVID-19.
According to him, such a picture is observed in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked to the bitch (she died long ago) like this - if you're ready to exchange a warm home, feeding, caresses, love and games for a female dog, go ahead.
But Pesel was trained and generally smart.
My society chose and went home.
A video showing the technique that works in 90% of cases.
Don't take it from the ceiling, trust me.
I held many owners back so they would not run after the dog, although they apologised, saying "it's OK, 200,000 roubles (about Â£2,000), I'm taking your hand and leading you to the other side.
In the end, "200,000" chose an owner, not a dog that ran away somewhere.
Massive protests against vaccination continue in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with restrictive measures and plans by authorities to make vaccination mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Outraged by the government's healthcare policies, Spaniards have staged a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held placards saying "This is a false pandemic", "I will not be vaccinated".
A large-scale protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a coronavirus certificate is required to access bars, restaurants, sports centres, retirement homes and night-time entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was taken by the authorities of several regions of the country amid a rise in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action started peacefully but later turned into clashes with riot police.
A group of demonstrators started to throw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.

WHO found "omicron" already in dozens of countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the new coronavirus "Omicron" has been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The spread of the strain was reported by the WHO.
According to the organization, by December 9, the virus had been detected in 63 countries, all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has been actively spreading since the end of November.
WHO also expressed concern about the rapid spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
Experts from the WHO expressed concern that the new strain, based on preliminary data, could outstrip the spread of the "delta" strain, or the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all absolutely countries without exception.
Before that, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the Omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
In a similar vein, Britain also came to the conclusion.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "Omicron" will displace "Delta" in the near future.
And the number of cases in Britain alone is expected to reach 1 million. Officially, there are only a few hundred people infected in the UK, and up to 10,000 according to estimates.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "omicron" strain, and at the peak hospitals will be dealing with more than 2,000 people a day.
The British healthcare system will not be able to cope with it.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest studies, the effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower than against other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian "Sputnik V" will react to the "omicron" - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Center for the Study of the Evolution of Infectious Diseases has only recently begun testing the Russian vaccine on the "omicron" strain.

Our Petersburg, that is, Leningrad, communal apartment with Big Zelenina is still in touch.
Of course, we are not the closest of friends, but we try to maintain warm relations between the generations.
Maybe it has to do with the fact that there were no guests in the apartment, the room was not rented out, and the blockade fraternity did not cancel each other.
Unfortunately, we are seeing them more and more at funerals.

In Brazil, seven people died in floods
At least seven people died and 175 were injured as a result of powerful rains that fell on the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia and neighboring Minas Gerais.
This is reported by TASS with reference to rescue services.
From the middle of the week a tropical cyclone has been raging on the border of these states, as a result of which the level of rainfall in the region reached 450 mm. In 25 municipalities of the state of Bahia the state of emergency has been declared, and in some of them floods have become the most destructive in 35 years.
Several bridges have been destroyed, two dams in rivers, and traffic has been blocked on three roads.
According to rescuers, around 5,700 people were left homeless, while 6,700 were forced to leave their homes.
The damage caused by the natural disaster affected over 85,000 residents of the region.

$135 billion went to applications - Hi-Tech
In 2021, global spending on applications increased by 25% and the number of downloads increased by 8%.
The most popular in the world turned out to be various video services.
Users downloaded the video editor CapCut the most, and spent the most time on YouTube.
And the number of app downloads, and user spending on them, showed a significant increase from January to November 2021.
The number of loads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. More significantly, the expenses of users in applications increased by 25%, up to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile applications market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from the lockdown and began post-pandemic recovery.
Does such a "return to physical" growth stifle the economy? Not at all, say the authors of the report.
India is the leader in terms of the number of downloads of applications: it accounts for about 20% of all downloads.
They are followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
iOS users, as always, spent more than Android users: 65% of all app spending went to iOS.
Among the applications, the video editor CapCut took the first place in terms of the number of downloads in 2021.
They are followed by two Indian apps: video service MX TakaTak and e-commerce app Meesho.
Telegram is also in the top 10 by the number of downloads.
Overall, if judged by the number of downloads, VPN-services are popular among users (two of them are in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN), as well as services related to creating and uploading videos (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak in the top 10, there are two more such services - Moj and SnackVideo).
Users spent most of their time in apps for live streaming and online streaming, the report says.
YouTube is leading here, and the top five in terms of user spending also includes TikTok, Disney+ and HBO Max streaming video services, and Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.
The first places in terms of the number of monthly active users are occupied by Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok, and completes the top five is the mobile version of Microsoft Office.
In Russia, the leader in terms of the number of downloads per year is the shopping application AliExpress.
It's followed by Zenly, which shows you the location of your friends, and the same CapCut.
Also in the top 10 apps are: online karaoke StarMaker, online clothing retailer Shein, Maps for Minecraft PE, online taxi service DiDi, YouTube Pure Tuber client, online retailer "Didi" and online store "Selfie".
Across the globe, people have adapted to the pandemic by moving to work from home, which can be seen as one of the main conclusions.
The sectors that did best were those that helped people connect virtually or in person," said App Annie's vice president of market insights, Lexi Sydow.
The mobile games market generated $90 billion in revenue in 2021. Casual and hyper-casual games, which have little or no storyline and minimal video content, topped the charts in terms of downloads.
The top three most popular games in the world are Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, among games, DOP 2: Delete One Part is leading, followed by Going Balls and Phone Case DIY.
App Annie previously presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the key trends for the next year, analysts at the company have named the growth of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the growth in popularity of financial apps among Generation Z, such as Robinhood, and the continued growth in popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians warned about new scheme of scammers
Scammers have started looking for new ways to deceive people via messages.
About this writes "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon's Director of Products, Zaura Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is dipping.
In this case, scammers create fake videos based on real recordings with the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to precisely reproduce the features of a person's behavior.
Abutalimov added that using a deep fake, criminals can call victims via video call or create a video with a lookalike for extortion.
'Such forgeries are easily capable of causing bullying as the duped perpetrator can place individuals in embarrassing, dangerous or compromising scenarios,' he said.
Lead systems engineer at Varonis, Alexander Vetok, added that people are more likely to trust others when they see them.
He underlined that this could create specific risks in case of technologies using video.
David, I'll add.
In what I've written above, I've focused on the fact that all this was bought in a small town where the local mentality didn't allow you to dress up and wear short skirts and show pantyhose with ankle socks.
This is a province, but in the store there was such a product.
In big cities and among Muslims, women started to dress up and show off.
That's how it is in Dushanbe, a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are a lot of make-ups, but there is no same cosmetics.
Five actions to avoid sugar diabetes
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
However, some people do not give this much importance, and they are wrong.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play the main role in preventing the disease.
For example, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to plain water positively affects metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
So the first step on the road to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keep them out of the house.
The appearance of the disease is influenced not only by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, you need to move more.
Experts recommend a low-carb diet.
A diet like this not only helps you lose weight, but also protects against sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fibre.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of satiety, the release of gastrointestinal juices and the increase of food intake.

Doctor Pavlova told about the "weekend migraine" among the overworkers
A few factors can contribute to a worsening of mood on weekends
The reason for the deterioration of self-esteem after working days is often "the hangover of the weekend day," said a well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of the MGU, scientific director of the Clinic of System Medicine Zouhra Pavlova in her Telegram channel.
According to her words, those who suffer from it most often are tradesmen, who on weekends often suffer from a headache, dizziness and weakness.
Doctor Pavlova noted that, in addition to the accumulated fatigue over the week, there are quite a few objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to the change in conditions.
In the weekend our life is fundamentally changed.
We sleep long, all day we lie on the couch, probably we will eat more, and drink less - the doctor justified. - Due to the lack of coffee, there is a small breakdown.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and breakdown."
A late rally also helps.
For example, if you stand up three hours later than usual, you'll get a reaction called jet lag.
It arises in travellers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays the decisive role in worsening one's mood, Pavlova recommends tracking what changes the most on weekends.

Scientists in South Africa say Pfizer vaccine is not very effective against "microcephaly"
In South Africa, Pfizer's vaccine against "microcephaly" was declared ineffective
Scientists in South Africa have carried out research and reported low effectiveness of Pfizer's vaccine against the Omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds (to the level) of the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection with symptoms, which... raises doubts about the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, - says the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts specified that the drug can prevent a severe course of the disease.
Previously, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the Omicron strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar in common products?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
His excess in the diet may lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that under unknown words in the composition of the product may be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition and glycemic index.
Several dozen names can be represented on the label, in essence representing sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
Other sweeteners may also be used, such as dextrose (a sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), melassa (black treacle), agave syrup, and so on.
That's all simple sugars, which are mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery products, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, in bread and more.
As claimed by Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar taste different, but no matter what it's called in the ingredient list - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it's still sugar.
It's not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar because you have to take into account not only the amount of sugar stated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits and other foods originally contain a certain amount of sugar.
As a result, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than declared on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the import of gas is losing importance for Germany as the country continues to transition to a decarbonized economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role, - the Chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to be committed to the fact that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas in the future, as it is currently an important resource for the country's energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which they affirmed their support for Berlin's energy transformation of Ukraine.
Earlier, the head of the German Foreign Office, Annalena Beyer, said that the certification of the "Nord Stream 2" gas pipeline was continuing.
According to the minister, within the framework of coalition talks and the discussion of the coalition treaty, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also said that the pipeline "does not meet the requirements" of the European Union.

Hackers broke into Twitter of the Prime Minister of India
Hackers have broken into the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The perpetrators managed to publish a false message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi's office asked staff to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter responded quickly - access to the account was restored.
India's Prime Minister had his page hacked in 2020 and asked for donations to be made using cryptocurrency.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, a majority voted against independence
A third referendum in New Caledonia, held on December 12, had the same result as the previous two.
According to initial partial results announced Sunday, Dec. 12, at noon, most New Caledonians voted against independence in the referendum.
However, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted for independence of New Caledonia from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90%, with a total of more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia voting in the elections.
As the French press agency France-Presse comments, "the outcome of these elections did not leave room for doubt," as supporters of independence called on voters to boycott the ballot.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, considering that the new outbreak of COVID-19 on the archipelago hinders holding a full-scale and "fair" pre-election campaign.
This abstention thus opened the way for a third victory for the supporters of French New Caledonia after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, and in 2020 - 53.3%.
As separatists stated, they do not recognize the results of the latest vote and will appeal against them in the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12th, in the Elysee Palace, the President of France Emmanuel Macron is expected to make a statement on the outcome of the referendum.
The topic of independence for New Caledonia has been a major issue in the French presidential campaign over the last weeks.
A number of candidates for the presidency have spoken out in favour of the territory remaining in France's possession, as it is "the last region of European Union presence in the Pacific".
âNew Caledonia must remain French,â reiterated Eric Zemmour.
Republican candidate Valerie Pecresse also made a similar statement. At the end of October, she published an article in Le Figaro calling on Caledonians to stay French.
On his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "as it was not his responsibility".
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, for his part, expressed "a strong desire for the choice of the Caledonians to be a choice for France."
Hello, Svetlana!
I'm a little... a little embarrassed, still.
Thank you for not turning away from my channel.

But as an artist - generally not an artist: what would you change?
But do not forget that food was natural then, so obesity was not as widespread as it is now.
And medicine was at zero - pills, horseradish and decoctions.

In Turkey, the first unmanned aerial vehicle with laser weaponry was tested
Tests of the world's first drone with a laser weapon have been successful in Turkey.
The "Eren" drone was tested at a distance of 100 to 500 meters, "MIR24" reports.
The device can neutralize explosive objects at a distance using a laser.
The maximum flight altitude of the new model reaches 3,000 m.
After passing the relevant tests, the BPLA should be delivered to the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy explosive devices without involving sappers.
The agency stresses that Turkey is among six countries in the world capable of developing and producing their own drones.

Readers of the WSJ criticized the article on relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized a column by professor Christopher Harvie, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the US.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West was sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger emanating from Moscow, and made a series of insulting remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "stand together against Russia".
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the professor's position.
There's a lot of false information in this article," - one of the readers commented RIA Novosti.
Europe is not ours to "lose," and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and its NATO allies will never start a nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine," another pointed out.

By transmitting nutrients to the skin, hydrogel minimizes the accompanying loss of moisture and forces the essence to penetrate deep into the skin.

Earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands region
A magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km to the northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The epicenter was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier seismologists recorded an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new generation of reactive drones
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will start producing ANKA-type reactive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
This was reported by the unofficial adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, Alexei Arestovich, on December 11.
In other words, they are capable of acting against aerial targets, against other drones.
Even against piloted aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and other Turkish avionics: the fuselage and so on," he was quoted by Dialog.ua as saying.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA unmanned aerial vehicles, Arestovich said that they are powered by reactors, not piston engines.
According to him, this new generation of drones after Bayraktar exceeds it "in all characteristics."
The first batch of drones is to be produced by the factory at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aeronautics and Space Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in collaboration with a number of private companies from 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of drones Bayraktar and missile complexes Javelin during the military operations of the combined forces in Donbass.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the construction of a factory for the production of modern military drones has begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region where personnel will be trained, as well as the testing and maintenance of Turkish BPLA Bayraktar.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from the container at the airport
Lions escaped from Singapore's Changi Airport.
This was reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from the container with seven lions, which arrived on one of the planes.
The paper notes that it remains unclear where they came from and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals couldn't get away because there was a protective net set up next to it.
The stand-off ended when staff from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which runs all Singapore zoos, arrived at the airport.
They immobilized the lions using darts laced with tranquilizer and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and wandered the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal returned to its home voluntarily, and no people were injured.
Specialists warned of the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies show that excessive amounts of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is solid evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are at a lower risk of colorectal cancer, among others.
However, excessive doses can promote the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitschen advises monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms a day.
The risk of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure in either direction.
Kitschen recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, always monitoring the dose and avoiding foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fien called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Because it's in avocado, among other things, Fein recommended that men over 50 eat more of the fruit.
In the UK, around 75,000 people could die from the Omicron strain by April
British experts' forecasts show that due to the spread of the Omicron strain of the coronavirus in the UK, up to 75,000 people may die in the next five months if restrictive measures are not tightened in the winter.
This was reported by the newspaper The Guardian with reference to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists, who are part of the British Cabinet Office's scientific advisory group for emergencies, by April 2022 the country will have recorded at least 25,000 fatalities from the Omicron strain, and a total of 175,000 patients will be hospitalised.
At the peak of the epidemic, the hospital will accept more than 2,000 infected people every day.
'Serious measures will be needed to fight the coronavirus if the Omicron strain is more contagious than the Delta variant, and if the current vaccines don't work,' said mathematician Rosanna Barrard from the LSHTM.
Earlier, the U.K.'s National Health Security Authority said that if the speed of the outbreak of the Omicron strain remains at the current level, there will be around one million cases of infection in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the Omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
In the UK, 1,898 cases of the Omicron strain have been discovered, of which 633 were identified in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that the real figure could already be 10,000 cases.

The global demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter
The construction of superyachts this year and orders next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and fight climate change.
There are 1,200 yachts ordered in the world register, which is 25% more than last year.
In the era of the battle against the effects of climate change for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, it is hard to imagine that the number of people with the desire and the money for a floating fortress of more than $50 million will not be reduced, writes the Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there has not been such a frenzy in the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are fearful of contracting the virus on land and prefer to hide out from the pandemic on their own vessels.
The second reason is also linked to the coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are held by phone.
Broker Will Cristie told the paper the yard is taking orders for new yachts in 2025 and beyond.
This means that clients are prepared to pay more just to have their yacht ready a year or two earlier.
People just want freedom, and the super-rich can afford it, he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior by the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of austerity, travel into space, life on yachts or flying around in one's own jet provoke resentment in society, because the elite does not want to share the responsibility for changing the climate with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and are proposing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, even though they know it will be hard to implement given their mobility.
Meanwhile, it is only the number of super-yachts ordered that is impressive, but not their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 ships, 27 have a length of more than 100 metres.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 183-metre yacht called REV Ocean.
After launching, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "lunar pool" on board, as well as an underwater vehicle for exploring the ocean depths.
On existing superyachts, helipads, cinemas under the open sky and even fighting pits like the one on Gregor McGregor's yacht are commonplace. Professor of economic anthropology at Indiana University Richard Wilk says, compared to the total number of carbon emissions from parking gas, the carbon footprint of the super-rich is negligible.
But it matters symbolically because there are only about 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of excessive consumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists found out that the emission trace of billionaires is 1000 times higher than the trace of an average person.
If one person produces, on average, 5 tonnes of CO2 a year, then the biggest polluter in the world, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tonnes of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
In doing so, two thirds of the emissions track ended up on his yacht Eclipse, which measures 162.5 metres in length.
Even if the owner of the yacht is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the order to sail the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Owners of superyachts rarely inspire sympathy for others when they complain, via YouTube, like the richest woman in Australia, Gina Rinehart, who owns the continent's largest coal mines, that there is nowhere for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships of 50 metres.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol, leading to the development of colorectal cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is what the Daily Express writes about.
Experts came to the conclusion that drinking four or more portions of alcoholic drinks a week is linked to an increased risk of developing cancer.
The risk of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
In addition, the risk of developing colorectal cancer is higher in moderate drinkers than in women.
Scientists cannot pinpoint the exact cause of this type of cancer, but note that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, if not all, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very smart.
But even they don't realise how developed the four-legged offspring actually are.
For many years, biologists have been conducting various experiments to find out for sure how intelligent animals are.
Although a dog's vocabulary isn't as extensive as a human's, a new study shows they can respond to 89 words or phrases in a row.
The research was published in the Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, they don't understand politics, economics or art, but they often manage to deceive their owners.
Experts say some breeds show better results in understanding human language, but there's not enough statistical data for precise conclusions.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered to be dog geniuses - such as Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking and are not inferior to two-year-old children in their ability to learn.

Ukraine is ready for trade with the US and Russia
The US and Russia will be "trading" over Ukraine's inclusion in NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov writes in his article for "Glavred".
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations in the near future on guarantees from the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "go wherever they want."
If you are offered something you know is unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you don't negotiate, you just say no and walk away.
As for Ukraine, "trade is scheduled," the analyst wrote.
Kozeletkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine and is striving for a dialogue with Kiev.
Training is carried out secretly, quickly and immediately switches to offensive actions instead of waiting for the grouping to be discovered and opposed, he said.
China stimulates the development of the railway transport sector
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the USA, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Exhibition on Railway Transportation and Equipment, held in the city of Chuzhou in the province of Hunan /central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical problems, said a representative of the company, Hou Zhao'wen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway, which was put into service at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and operational capability of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its exports of railway transport vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-story high-speed electric trains developed in China rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. and were exported to Europe.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will operate on the rail networks of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train, developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey, began.
The train will move along the subway line connecting the center of Istanbul to the city's airport.
The line will open next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey, travelling at 120 kilometres an hour.
âChinaâs railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovative competitiveness,â said Fan Yojiang, head of the Department of Trade and Investment Promotion of the China Council for Promoting International Trade /CCPIT/.
This sector accounts for the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the world market, "said Feng Yaosian.
After more than 60 years of intense work, China has created a leading system of production equipment for railway transport, with a full range of supporting facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosian, the country ranks first in terms of the level of electrification of railways and the operating mileage of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences, Semen Golochekin, in an interview with radio Sputnik, listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia may be forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of mild cognitive disorders, such as an inability to concentrate, planning, abstract thinking.
Currently there is a discussion about whether hearing loss can be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease or one of the risk factors for its emergence, the expert said.
Goloshchikin stressed that dementia can be caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head traumas, some infections, metabolic disorders, and vitamin deficiency.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective methods of treating dementia.
So it is necessary to start its prophylaxis in time.
According to him, reducing the risk of developing dementia will help studying foreign languages and active communication.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking.
There are recommendations on the use of various BADs, but their effectiveness and advisability are still discussed in the scientific community, said Golochekin.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical load, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities with the help of games and hobbies requiring intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking, - said Golozekin.
Earlier this year, the British charity Alzheimer's Research UK said the disease was increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors have identified early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first sign of trouble can be problems with vision, making it difficult for the patient to recognise objects.
Another sign of developing dementia is aphasia - a condition where a person can't find the right words to say what they want to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili abroad for treatment
Former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the team of doctors created by the Georgian ombudsman, told journalists.
His neurological status is leading in his illness.
The stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, and character inconsistency," - said an expert, noting that this does not go beyond the norm and now the ex-president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia, - noted Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
In the evening of December 7, Saakashvili started to obstruct obtaining medical assistance after the penitentiary service officers applied disciplinary penalty to him.
The Georgian politician managed to have the punishment lifted and his rights reinstated quickly.

In Spain, protests against COVID-19 passports
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests were held against compulsory certification of vaccination against COVID-19, Europa Press reports.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was about 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, COVID-19 passports have become mandatory to enter bars, restaurants, sports centres, retirement homes and night-time entertainment venues.
Many of the protesters came without masks.
Slogans on their posters accused the state of totalitarianism and called for the respect of citizens' choice.
In Valencia, passports will also be required for entry to entertainment venues and restaurants with more than 50 seats.
Protesters in the city have declared a medical dictatorship, calling vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified since the beginning of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to introduce restrictions for non-vaccinated people.
The government submitted draft legislation on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering establishments and retail outlets with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a passport to a disease or a medical record of vaccination.
Such rules will be established for trips on trains and aircraft.

A steep ascent: how Chinese people become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create resorts of international level in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to take up winter sports, which will allow the collection of the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also promote economic development in backward and remote provinces.
The ski resort of Taival in Zhangjiakou, located close to the site of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to building infrastructure in the region, there are also works on landscaping: the workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are big enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where the resorts are located, including Zhanjiang, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to ensure comfortable and interesting holidays in Chinese resorts so that all beginners become regulars.
However, that is still a long way off.
Justin Downes, the IOC's consultant on the Games, said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year in winter more and more Chinese people go to the mountains.
Fiona, the snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite serious changes that will take many years to implement, it will take even longer to create a ski culture here, Downs believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Chunli, near the location of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, and now, none of the local residents are suffering from unemployment.
More and more shops are opening in the country selling clothes and equipment for winter sports.
Mountain slopes open points of general meals with dishes of national cuisine.
There is even a testing station for COVID-19 on Tavua now.
China is striving to create a prosperous winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and facilities should reach the world-class level.
More than 500 million people worldwide may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO said
More than 500 million people worldwide may be plunged into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled progress on universal health coverage, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank said.
In connection with the International Day of Universal Health Coverage on December 12, WHO and the World Bank have published two complementary reports.
In them, they noted that the pandemic has led to disruptions in the provision of medical services and has caused excessive stress in the healthcare system.
As a result, for the first time in 10 years, the population's immunization coverage decreased, and deaths from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people into "extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their pocket."
In October, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres said that the pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty and left almost four billion without social protection.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister disconnected from transmission at the "Democratic Summit" at the request of the White House
The appearance of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology, Audrey Tang, at a panel discussion during the US-organized "Democracy Summit" was translated into an audio-only mode, according to a YouTube recording of the summit.
Reuters, citing sources, said the picture was taken down at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason for this was a map on which Taiwan was marked in a different color from China, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was created by CIVICUS, a non-governmental organization based in South Africa, and ranked countries by their level of protection of civil rights.
Taiwan was marked green as "free", while China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were marked red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced by a screenshot with the comment that "participants' opinions do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government."
China was not invited to the "Democratic Summit".
Reuters sources noted that the map the Taiwanese minister showed could go against Washington's "one China" policy.
One source told the agency that after the map was shown to the U.S. National Security Council, the State Department angrily complained to the Department of State, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Democracy Summit" was held from December 9 to 10, involving representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society and non-governmental organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, the editor-in-chief of the "New Newspaper" newspaper, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of Russia, Yuri Averianov, stated that the summit was "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese".

The New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight
The New Shepard spacecraft, operated by Blue Origin, carried six tourists on a suborbital flight on Saturday, December 11.

The rocket-carrier itself landed on the spaceport's runway.
Blue Origin successfully completed the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard spacecraft with passengers on board on July 20.

Don't lump everyone together - there are bad people everywhere, and you may have your own grievances with them...
but what about the number of children, their age, the pension fund and so on?
Write that they are "thieves who did not return the money."
But it's not your business how many children they have, as long as they don't bring them to you.
And if this is not the case, what right do you have to condemn them?
Maybe it's just in education...
Chosen (by themselves) parents dictate their rules, openly violating those that already exist.
And if it will be related to other spheres of life, judicial system and so on?
For them, laws are not written.
And if the Pope does introduce his method of education and upbringing?
Whatever it is, it's a bad example for others.

China is stepping up prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports are located
The State Council of China issued a circular requiring strengthened prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports are located, with a view to preventing the import of infection from overseas.
According to the circular, people leaving the listed cities must provide a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test result obtained within 48 hours of departure.
Those arriving in towns with land border crossings must undergo at least one test for COVID-19 nucleic acids upon arrival.
The document says the requirements will come into force on the day the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities where land checkpoints are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told about the "sad outcome" of Russia-US relations
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov assessed the prospects for Moscow and Washington's relations in an interview with "Izvestia."
He noted that the long path of interaction led to sad conclusions, and problems between the two countries began not yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but as for some prospects of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
It's a sad conclusion based on the journey we've been on with this administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems began not yesterday, - the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are connected with the attempts by the United States to impose its approaches on Russia on numerous issues.
The deputy head of the MFA added that he would not have dared to give optimistic forecasts for the prospects for improving relations and did not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, progress is not observed.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to approach international security issues responsibly and hopes that the signals will be heard and that Americans will listen to the arguments of reason.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated at a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Moscow is ready to restore the dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns of danger of nasal vaccine against COVID outside hospitals
There may be an allergic reaction in people who have got used to the nasal vaccine against COVID-19, and they may need medical help, so the first points where this vaccine will be administered should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was announced by TASS virologist, member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of biological nanotechnology, microbiology and virology at the Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It would be easier to set up nasal spray vaccination points in airports and shopping centres, but I would initially do this only in medical facilities.
The point is that there is a chance of an allergic reaction to the vaccine, it is small, but it is better for the person to stay near a doctor's office afterward.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy drugs that work literally within a minute or two, which is sometimes very useful," - said Netesov.
In the opinion of a virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccinating in shopping centres when there is experience of using the drug.
He also stressed that it is important for the nasal vaccine to reach the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
However, there is a chance that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the nose is congested when the injection is given.

In the UK, 1,239 cases of the Omicron strain of the coronavirus were recorded in a day - RT in Russian
In the UK, 1,239 cases of infection with the new Omicron strain of the coronavirus have been identified in a day.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the "omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with a new variety of the infection in Scotland and five - in Northern Ireland.
The total number of cases of COVID-19 from the new strain in the UK has reached 3,137 people.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine made a pessimistic forecast that 75,000 people could die in England due to the outbreak of coronavirus caused by the "omicron" strain by April.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including the alleged "invasion" on the country's territory.
It is impossible to introduce some restrictions against Russia and not to suffer ourselves, - the official representative of the Kremlin said in the air of the "Russia 1" TV channel.
Peskov says that "everyone in the world understands this."
Earlier it was reported that the United States was considering imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the EU are planning to introduce restrictions aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, Sberbank CEO German Greff is confident that this is impossible.

Residents of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on independence in New Caledonia, an overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported by French television channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% of those who voted were against independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the south of the Pacific Ocean supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
The turnout on the day was very low: around 55% of the island's population came out to vote.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by calls by separatists to boycott the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia voted in a referendum against independence from France.
A referendum on independence was held in the region in 2018.
Most residents supported the archipelago's inclusion in France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers from the mainland of France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia a possession.
Around 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has been granted special administrative territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian authorities stipulates that the region can hold a referendum on independence twice every two years.

WHO considers "omicron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization preliminarily considers that "Omicron" is less dangerous than the Delta strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there are data on the decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines against the new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, "Omicron" has been registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and significantly altered antigenic profile of the "omicron" strain protein suggest a reduced efficacy of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it ("the severity of the illness" - rare) may be less severe than in "deltas," - says the WHO statement.
The organisation notes that while all registered cases of "Omicron" infection in the EU have so far been mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain appears to be spreading faster than "the delta".
Two cases of infection with the Omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They "previously were immunized," the Center for Disease Control said.
Rospotrebnadzor head Anna Popova said there were no reliable data that the new version of the coronavirus was less dangerous than others.

Four scenarios for Zelensky in Ukraine
Ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
According to him, the head of state can remain without support from the West, and also possibly make concessions on Donbass.
This was reported by Denisenko on Sunday, December 12, in a publication on the "Glavred" portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called the "ideal storm," envisages that Ukraine will stop being supported by key Western countries reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis, which Kyiv may face in 2023.
At the same time, there is a fall in prices of key goods that we have traditionally exported... there are internal protests and confrontation with key FPGs [financial-industrial groups]," the ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against everyone".
This forecast will come true in case of high turbulence in world politics, when Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this situation, the leadership of Ukraine may go to compromises over Donbass, which may lead to confrontation within the country.
At the end of the summer, the positions of Zelensky will weaken, and the likelihood of such a situation is 50-55%, according to the former MP.
The third scenario for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of the non-agreement population groups and the president, which may result in the takeover of control over the power block and the implementation of "populist initiatives."
During such a crisis, Zelensky will start "reforming the authorities," Denisenko added.
Another scenario - the transformation of Zelensky into "the father of the nation."
This can be triggered by some event that will be a strong shock for society.
The event should be sufficiently large in scale to cause a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine, Denisenko said.
Such a development of the situation is possible due to a natural disaster, technogenic catastrophe or aggressive actions by Russia, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it was precisely the Ukrainian authorities, Nato and the United States that were increasing military activity on the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had fallen to record lows, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest rating since he came to power.
Analysts predicted a situation where, in the event of the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, Zelensky would receive only 21.8% of the vote, while ex-president Petro Poroshenko would receive 14.5%.
Among all those polled, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Thank you for the story about the great athlete who didn't know that Elena Shushunova had died - it's very sad to find out this way.
I remember how we were rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us residents of the Primorye Territory, it was live coverage, real time.
Such passions, emotions inflamed, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They were also happy with the other victories, as they were rooting for Salnikov, for the footballers, for all the Soviet athletes at the time.
I saw a documentary on TV about one of the Central American countries, and they were loading the arugula onto the ship's deck, like barrels.
The pumpkins were huge.
As a young man, I worked many times on the harvesting and loading of melons in Astrakhan region and I have never seen a melon weighing more than a hundred pounds.
I buy 4-5 kg of figs from the bazaar and not before the beginning of August.

It is this element that allows the lace not to stretch.

The poet arrested for a Red Square action: "10 days for a quotation from Evtushenko - here it is, the strength of poetry!"
Earlier this week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student from the Higher School of Economics was detained on Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #poetvrosiibolshechepoet was written.
This quote is attributed to writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander under an administrative article for repeated violation of public order.
He was detained for the first time on January 23 on the Pushkin Square at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
The aim was to draw attention to poetry in general nowadays, unfortunately, interest in it has been lost, along with the decline of culture in general in Russia, and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems under this hashtag in the Internet, - explains Alexander.
We reached out to the young poet to inquire about the circumstances of his arrest and to learn more about his message.
How have the police dealt with you during previous arrests?
What did the department ask about and how did they comment on your action?
This time the officers were more correct, the detention was maximum, polite, as if it would sound funny in some context.
The OMON officers took to the streets of Pushkin in force.
They asked standard questions about motives.
When they heard about it, in principle, they looked if not approving, then understanding.
Except for the blowing on all four sides of the monkey, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was doing.
And if after the action under this hashtag begins to write their poems even a few people, I will not be in vain these 10 days.
Maxim, according to the protocol, can talk to you alone in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, people speak the language of the region so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their own language via an interpreter.
This is the protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian well and still uses a translator.
And even at official events, stenograms are taken by hand, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.
If you don't want to say much, just say no!

Researchers reveal how potatoes can help fight age-related decline
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and minerals that help improve blood flow and reduce cholesterol levels.
The root contains vitamins of the B group, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the body to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Thanks to its high content of chlorella, it is beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract, and may also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis if taken regularly.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root vegetable is best boiled or stewed, not fried in oil.
Earlier this year, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, along with other foods high in glycaemic index.
This includes foods with a high glycaemic index, which are quickly broken down into sugar, such as sugar, sugary drinks, white rice and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in their production in private household plots and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current deficit in production can only be made up by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates remove "Yandex" from distribution
Candidates for elimination
In 2015, right holders from the RAEK/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate websites on the Russian segment of the Internet and most of them ceased to exist, says Director of the Institute for the Study of the Internet Karen Kazaryan.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - managed to survive thanks to, among other things, regular changes of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both "Yandex" and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Carnival Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest Russian video service ivi (which is part of the AI Vision).
On Kinogo, which is also available via search engines, you can watch the new animated film Enkanto, but, judging by the quality of the video, it is called a screening (shot in a cinema pirate copy of the film).
Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, offers the series "University. 10 years later" from the TNT channel (owned by "Gazprom-media").

Wall light Maytoni MOD081WL Tessara.
A wide circle, framed by "molecules" of light, ensures the most even and bright illumination of the space.
The "atomic" or "molecular" design, which reflects the essence and natural nature of each object, remains relevant and allows accents to be effectively placed in the interior.
One of the characteristic features of such lamps is their lightness of construction.
Thanks to thin, almost invisible cables that can be adjusted for height, there is a sense that the light is suspended in mid-air.
Metal gold-plated fittings and matte-white miniature ceiling panels will easily complement any colour scheme, and the suspended chandelier and table lamp presented in the collection will make a ready-made ensemble for lighting the living room, bedroom, hallway.
Well, in taste and color, as they say.
I really liked "Tarkhun", not the current one, of course.
The juices, served in tall glass cylinders, were delicious.

DimaX Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimat.
The model is convenient as it has two different surfaces with different hardness - high hardness and a bit softer.
The product includes only quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves exclusively on the best side.
The springs: the block of independent springs "micropacket" is installed in the center of the model.
This means that there are 2000 spirals in the bed, which work fully autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives the unique point-by-point adjustment.
The "Micropack" is the most high-frequency of all the "Diamax" piston blocks, so it has a distinct orthopaedic effect and is considered a premium product.
Infill: a combination of coir and natural latex is used on the top and bottom of the pocket.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface is covered in latex, the other is likely to be coconut oil.
Such a tandem of fillers has long ceased to be a classic, as it not only conveys orthopedic, but also anatomical properties to the mattress.
If coir provides the right support for the back, latex offers a surface that adapts to the body.
Cover: the model is supplied in a sheer chiffon cover Aloe Vera.
If the client wishes, it can be made as a detachable or fixed unit.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, and the recommended load for a sleeping place is 170 kg.
Guarantee and security: the warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certification.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, "Actual Camera" reported on Sunday.
The goal of missions starting five years from now is to assess the suitability of clouds on Venus for life, and then search for it there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed instruments for measuring acidity and oxygen content in clouds on Venus.
It was previously assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, were too acidic to host life, but it now seems likely that Venus was originally a Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus is expected to arrive.
Let's assume that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to Earth or different.
If it's very similar, it will be obvious that life on Earth didn't start on Earth.
If there is a difference, then it may be more likely that life arose on Earth," - said the leader of the Estonian "Venus Life Finder" project Mikkhel Paasalu.

Metaphysical entities will change Russian business
The topic of metaverse became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced to transform Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in the creation of its own metaspace and subsequent monetization.
Metaphysical entities should be considered as a continuation of the objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards creating remote interaction in the conditions of the pandemic, because people are tired of disconnection and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of businesses' desire to develop ecosystems and adapt their operating models to them.
The third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to a digital format.
Ania, you're right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want anything too greasy and harmful.
Of course, there will be traditional olive and horseradish at the holiday, but no one is forcing me to overeat all at once.
You can eat it by the glass, try it - and it's enough.
After all, there are ten weekends ahead, and you can prepare any tasty and healthy dishes.

And to those who didn't just do sport or aren't aware of all the circles of hell they've been to, DON'T JUDGE.
British economist failed to predict for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022 because, in his view, such attempts will end in failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
Experts believe that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend may change the situation.
The most important factor remains the pandemic of coronavirus, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted he did not know if the rise in prices was temporary or not.
As the expert indicated, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the era of central banks' infinite generosity has come to an end" and it is time to return to relationships where interest rates are correlated with expected rates of economic growth.
Mr O'Neill noted that, against the backdrop of the pandemic, some experts believe that the continuation of ultra-loose monetary policy could lead to a new round of inflation.
In addition, it is important to pay attention to the question of productivity growth, as well as rising levels of poverty and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Earlier, the head of the global research department at "Discovery Investment" Mikhail Shulgin reported that positive expectations for the course of the dollar in 2022 remain, while the potential for growth will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar Shulgin named the monetary and credit policy of the Fed, the dynamics of oil prices and fears amid the pandemic of coronavirus.
She was forced to agree.
But there is one thing that is encouraging: if you compare yourself with yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
Progress is slow.
There is another problem: there are many ecological initiatives in towns, but people do not know about them.
Any eco-taxi that takes away your rubbish from home.
And the point of acceptance of waste is banally used by marginals.
It's rare to find glass and metal there.

Russians gave auto dealers around 4.5% of GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2.784 trillion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period of the previous year, the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI) agency reported.
To understand the scale, about the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state on supporting citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
In September of last year, at a meeting of the heads of the countries of the Shanghai Organization of Cooperation, President Vladimir Putin said that such a sum was equivalent to more than 4.5% of the country's domestic gross product (GDP) in 2020.
Korean brand Kia is the leader in the Russian market by income.
In 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars for a total of 32.57 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year ago.
At the related Kia brand of Hyundai, the increase was even more significant - over 35%, and revenue from the sale of machines is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is in the lead in terms of increasing the average price of automobiles - over the year, the average price of Hyundai cars increased by almost 21%, up to 1.94 million rubles - the dynamics of price growth was stronger only for Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales of Korean brands increased less significantly: according to the statistics of the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more machines in the same period than a year ago.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Closing the top three by volume of sales is Japanese Toyota - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year ago.
Following the Japanese is Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion roubles (+75%), and the German premium brand saw both the volume of sales (up 37%) and the average price of cars (almost 28%, up to 820,000 roubles) grow.
At Mercedes-Benz there has been a good increase in sales and the average price - more, for example, than at BMW - which has led to a greater increase in financial capacity, explained the general director of NAPI Tatiana Arabadzhie.
On the growth rate of sales, fantastic figures are demonstrated by Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year.
Russia's Lada is demonstrating medium-range income growth dynamics (plus 28%), and Russians have spent 229.4 billion rubles on this brand's cars in 10 months.
At the level of the previous year, in terms of financial capacity, there are companies whose sales of machines fell in 2021: for example, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and in the minus - Russians spent 12 billion rubles on off-road vehicles and pickups of this brand in 10 months against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
In the face of problems with supplies of automotive components and production disruptions affecting the entire world's automotive industry, car companies continue to revise prices unceasingly - the same "AvtoVAZ" increased the cost of the Lada models seven times a year, the latest price hike (by 8-10 thousand rubles) took place in late November.
They regularly revise their price lists for their products and those of other car manufacturers.
The volume of the automotive market in monetary terms will increase further - besides the deficit of machines, inflation is also contributing to this, and the automakers' desire to make up for previous losses, experts believe.
In conditions of a deficit of cars, I think that many car manufacturers have even been able to shift some of the costs incurred in previous periods onto consumers, which they were unable to include in the price of cars before,
Vladimir Bessapov, an analyst at VTB Capital, said.
I think that in financial terms, car manufacturers feel very comfortable now, with high margins on sales."
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, the cost of new cars is growing faster than inflation, the expert specified.
In the long term, the market will grow both in terms of quantity and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Bessapov.
As the supply of opportunities to raise prices increases, so will the limits.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the future year, even if the growth rate of car prices slows down, car manufacturers will be able to receive their income due to the volumes, says independent consultant on automotive Sergey Bulgazliev.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now trying to get the highest profit from each car they sell, says Burgazliev. -
The volume of production of machines is not expected to increase at least in the next six months, while in Russia, the frenzy is fueled by citizens' uncertainty about the future.
Against the backdrop of the situation in the market, cars have turned out to be a good investment object - a car purchased a year ago, even with a history, can now be sold for more than its original value, the expert concludes.
Biden spoke about the transfer of US troops to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in case of "invasion" of Russia.
The statement was made by the President of the United States, Joe Biden.
There were "never any plans like that," the White House chief of staff responded when asked by a journalist whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that Russia will face economic consequences in case of escalation of the situation around Ukraine.
At the same time, he stressed that the US and NATO do not have any obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops in unilateral order for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will deploy forces in Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to defend them from any attack by Russia, "Biden said.
Earlier, Press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow had no intention of invading Ukraine.
At the same time, he indicated that Moscow sees the problem in the use of Turkish drones in combat, as well as the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."
I immediately leave such interviews.
If, already at the interview, they want to force me to listen to screams, wait for hours, drink incomprehensible broth and wash the cup - it's scary to imagine what it will be like at work.
I will find a normal place, without a layer of bureaucracy where you can talk to the leader immediately.

The Russian film "Fist of Fury", nominated for the "Oscar", won the award of the European Film Academy (also known as the "European "Oscar") in the nomination "Best Editing," reports "Moskovsky Komsomolets."
