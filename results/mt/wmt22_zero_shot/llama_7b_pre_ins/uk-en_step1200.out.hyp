Good day, please excuse me, I do not have Internet and could not send sooner. Thank you.
Could you please tell me the exact address where to go tomorrow to clean up, the code to the keys and at what time tomorrow guests leave and new guests move in?
I'm sorry, but I must decline your offer as I have already found a job.
I'm sorry, but I can't refuse.
Sometimes I feel like my thoughts in Czech are different from what I write in Ukrainian.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
Good day, I agree with the course.
However, if it's not too much trouble, is there time earlier?
But I don't live in Prague, there may be difficulties with transport.
If there are no alternatives, I am still in favour.
Thank you in advance.
In Herson, people again took to the streets for a rally, and the Russians were unable to disperse them
As reported by the agency, the participants of the action said that the residents of Kherson managed to hold a rally before the military of the Russian Federation with equipment arrived at the scene for dispersal.
We managed to hold a rally. The equipment of the Russian Federation has arrived there now, - one of the participants of the event reported.
Previously, residents traditionally gathered for protests on the square of Freedom - near the building of the ODA and the oblast council.
This square, as well as the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops, who use weapons against participants in the rallies and kidnap people.
It was reported that on 3 April armed Russian occupants used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As reported by Ukrinform, residents of Donetsk regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
Russian military uses force and weapons against people, there are wounded and arrested.
They are also kidnapping residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded Herson the special title "City-Hero".
On February 24, the President of Russia, Putin, began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure, carrying out mass shellings of residential areas in Ukrainian cities and villages with the use of artillery, multiple rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.
I often dream about my dad.
He died the day after my birthday.
And overall, it was a good night.
Hello, Hanah.
So I did what you wrote and the phone started charging!
Great news!
Thank you!
We can meet for a year or two, and then I'll go home because I don't have any necessary things with me.
The porter in the red overall is dragging a missile to the rubbish bin. The front in Kharkiv remains the same

Oleh also found me a part-time job - cleaning two one-bedroom apartments that are rented out to tourists.
Apartments in the center of Prague are located.
Will you be able to come to the bank with me on Monday? Or on another day?
Good day, it would be great if you could do it today as you wrote at 17:00
So I read the Bible, the Koran, other things, looking for answers to the questions I was asking.
Where is the housing that needs to be cleaned?
Do I have good dreams?

It would have been cheaper... we are forced to move because we cannot afford European prices.
I need to look at the place and try where it hurts
He wants to press on all my sore points now, and he knows where they are.
It has absolutely no impact on me.
She didn't want to talk about him and his drama yesterday at Misha's.
It is impossible to close the banks (and there is no need to stand in the rain) when there is no rain.
so I just feel uncomfortable in my own skin
This is my classmate Ukrainian
Alexandra runs from one corner to another, here there is so much that her eyes wander and she wants to be everywhere at once

Can we change with Valya? Valya in the morning, and I after lunch?
Mom will live here in the dormitory as the dormitory fee is paid for the dormitory.
The main thing is that I have a life
Sasha was not at school today, I wrote to the teacher.
Helloüëãüèª I am ill, so it would be better to postpone our meeting to the next weekend, sorry.
I can cook, the main thing is to have a recipe, but I like baking cakes.
In Ukraine, borscht, vareniki, other dishes are traditional.
I don't have any favorite dishes. I love trying different dishes from different countries.
What do you like to eat? Do you like to cook?
I want to be doing something
The train is more precise, but there are no seats
Sorry, we're a little late.
Lucy, can I have a helper in the kitchen?
It's very good that Julia will be able to go to work.
I went to their apartment last night.
There it is very crowded and inconvenient.
On Tuesday, Pablo will tell me if there will be work for Nazar at the brewery and when he needs to come to arrange the meeting.
If Nazar is working from 5:30, he can use any train:
Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war. If it stops fighting, our positions will be weak
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the fighting in eastern Ukraine, and in particular in Mariupol, will determine the course of the war ‚Äì and if the Ukrainian army suffers a defeat there, the Russians may leave the negotiations and reoccupy the territories they have occupied.
Straight talk: "Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It's beating - we're fighting, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, our positions will be weaker.
They (the defenders of the city - editor) are people who have drawn a large number of enemies to themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the country, in the OOS region, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in the dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If the situation is weak in all these directions, we may not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that may lead to the return of even those cities that we now occupy.
They can go and do that.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weak and, perhaps, not interesting for the Russian side.
Too bad, we confirm.
We believe in our result, in our victory...".
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution, if there will be one."
Directly: "People will accept a ceasefire in any case, because people want this war to end.
In our conditions, conditions of independence of Ukraine, but... every family has lost something - and I do not think that any peace will satisfy them under any circumstances.
But if we do not speak emotionally, war must end in peace, or it will end in millions of victims.
And even there, where millions of victims, everything comes to an end in the war.
So we must fight - but for life.
You can't fight for breath when there's nothing left, there's no people.
Good morning, do you have any free places left for the Czech language course for adults starting at 7 p.m. on Tuesday?
If you wish, you can meet your family in Kutna Hora.
And these two are my cousins.
I understand.

I'll try to clean up quickly, but I don't promise.
I'll let you know when the apartment is ready for guests.
Who makes the purchases of consumables?
Is it a permanent procedure, or do you order it as you need it?
In connection with the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts are needed to describe its new qualitative state.
The very analysis of metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, research of its state
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in contemporary literature allows for an analysis of the postmodern context as such, where metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion
Do you know how to tell online that I've got a job and I'm no longer claiming benefits?

But if you don't want to talk to me, I'm sorry
Why did you think you didn't need such experience?
Every situation is given for something.
Mostly, to change a person, especially spiritually.

The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published a list of Russian military servicemen who took part in committing war crimes in the city of Bucha, Kyiv region.
As reported by Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported this on Facebook.
Every Ukrainian must know their names!
The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine obtained a list of military personnel of the 64th separate motorized infantry brigade, who are directly involved in committing war crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha," the report said.
The GU MVD points out that all war criminals will be brought to justice for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine.
The list can be viewed by clicking on the link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel and the whole Kyiv region were liberated from Russian invaders.
Mass killings of civilians by Russian troops have been recorded in the liberated cities and villages.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, reported that 280 people were buried in the common grave.
General Prosecutor Iryna Venediktova stated that 3 April, 410 bodies of civilians killed by the Russian invaders were evacuated from the Kyiv region.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The armed forces of the Russian invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, carrying out mass shellings of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages with the use of artillery, rocket systems, ballistic missiles, and aviation bombs.
Good morning, I apologize, but I will not be able to work with you as I will be flying to Canada in the near future.
There are formal names immediately after the colon, slang expressions in square brackets, and abbreviations used in the schedule.
I don't want to bother you, have a rest
I looked at the weather forecast. It will be cold.
I don't need brands.
Just good clothes at normal prices and in the right sizes.
We were in the store at the railway station
The professions on offer. Are they possible without knowledge of the language?
It's important if there's a tradition that I should know about it so I can prepare)
I thought it would calm down in a week, but the situation is getting worse, sirens are constantly sounding
There may be a poor connection on the road tomorrow.
I am grateful for every experience, even if it is painful.
I think it's important to take experience from every situation and learn from it so you don't make the same mistakes again in the future.
Directives are introduced in the form of numbered written amendments, which are part of this Regulation.
I am confident that this problem will be solved.
Many people in Ukraine are also celebrating this week.
It depends on the religion.
Is the person Greek Catholic or Catholic?
You can try it for free at the beginning.
You can write an algorithm for payment, we will pay ourselves.
In our country, the paper that children receive at the end of the school year is a table, and a certificate is received upon birth and marriage
Yep! He's a pro on it! But I don't know if it's better. Feeling for the walls of the apartment
There they write that it is necessary to fill in, the biography, in Czech...
I will try to hurry up. Because I still have to go to the town hall, sign some documents
Wife not angry that you're on the phone
In my daily prayers I thank God and the Mother of God for you.
Let them cover you with their love and warmth of this night.
My heart belongs to you.
You are not against if I come immediately after the war?
The place, day and time will be specified according to the interests and capabilities.
We promised that when you go to school, we will bring you a surprise.
It's great, I have money for two months of rent, the district of Olovo doesn't matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my friends are deeply shocked by the news of the barbaric treatment of the civilian population to the north of Kiev.
Photographs of beheaded and executed people shocked the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how it was possible to happen in the 21st century? How?!
And I was not surprised at all. It was exactly what I expected...
I evacuated children and old people from Kiev during the second day of the war.
Then he returned to the capital with his colleagues and their children.
Since 2014, I have consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and have never doubted for a moment that my family would not be spared in the event of an occupation of the suburbs of Kyiv.
And I am absolutely convinced that the essence of the rotten Communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my grandfathers was shot in the prison of the city of Zhitomir.
A few years ago, in the Zhytomyr office of the SBU, they gave my grandfather's grandson a copy of the execution file: the whole file was over a hundred pages long, but the death sentence was very simple and all the more terrifying for that.
The defendant was illiterate and pleaded not guilty.
Ethnic Pole, Catholic, had five children, was a free man, poor "one-storey" nobility, never walked in serfs.
The fact that they lived in villages and had several cows was enough to condemn the peasants and childminders to death.
The family did not even know where he was buried.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people from the village were taken away and killed, except for two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case there is the name of the student Sharij.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighbouring village.
I believe in genetics and I'm not surprised if his relative was a KGB informer.
The apple does not fall far from the tree, as they say...
The firing squad that sentenced the peasants to death were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing his grandfather's case, he became interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (without irony) informational resources in Russia, such as the "Eternal Barracks," which qualitatively recall the events of those years.
Thus, in contemporary Russia, the descendants of the NKVD have found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin's repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers - the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It is alleged that files containing child pornography were found on the computer, and she was sent to prison for that, but she died soon after.
The KGB is killing those who try to find out the truth about the crimes of the previous century.
So why are you surprised by their actions now?!
There concentrated the most bestial traits of human nature.
The thousand-year-old tradition of the Horde was overlaid by slavery and imperial chauvinism in the 16th-19th centuries.
And then, over that, conducted a bestial genetic experiment, exterminating the intelligentsia in several waves of the red terror.
Check out the half-French film "The Chess Player" from 1992, and you'll see what I mean.
If you see my photos in a swimsuit
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from the shop.
I'm sorry, but I don't have anyone to ask.
I wanted to ask if you know where the children went, because Galya does not know.
Lyubosh, Igor asks if it is convenient for you to go tomorrow? (it is an exiting day and he can go, because they have not looked at the car today at the station).
We don't like to see you so worried.
You help us a lot, thank you!
‚óªÔ∏è In Boryspil, near Kyiv, during the clearing of the rubble of two multi-storey residential buildings, the bodies of 7 civilians were found.
Defenders of Mariupol claimed that an unidentified toxic substance was sprayed from a Russian drone over the city.
Three people were injured.
About 1,700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are being held in Russian prisons.
Among them are 500 women.
Germany is allocating one million euros to support the International Criminal Court, which is investigating war crimes committed by the Russian army in Ukraine.
‚óªÔ∏è Canada imposed sanctions on 33 Russian defense companies.
In the past day, one enemy tank, three armoured personnel carriers, three artillery systems, 24 units of automotive technology, one helicopter and three drones have been destroyed in the fighting in eastern Ukraine.
Your coffee is already here today.
My first "bicycle" after my son.
What do the girls do when they return from school?
We came to the place where we were settled from the center in Pardubice, the conditions are good.
But there's a big but here men drink alcohol and smoke inside, loud music is just the minimum that "drives you crazy", the smell of cigarettes and drunk men ... it's scary to sleep here if you're honest.
Be kind and help with housing, for money be kind.
But it will be safe there and not smoky.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is so strong, they smoke right there.
I'm begging you, one of them is barely standing up, something is screaming, something is not right. It's very scary.
I just ask if you can help.
The main thing is that we understand each other
Very positive, such a wonderful kindergarten, such nice teachers.
You do so much for us, it's incredible, we are very grateful ‚ù§Ô∏è
Good evening, Stefani, Agata wants to take part in the game, she's missing the game üòâ
We do not have enough locks

How do I get to the apartment today to clean?
As I will be near the main entrance, I will tell you and you will open?
I wanted to look at the cake for Carina
I forgot to tell you, sorry.
Yesterday everything went very well.
We talked about children with special needs and the system of their education in Ukraine.
When Ms Shakhova introduced me as an Fpoint employee, the first question was how they found the dog, how they found the moped.
Everyone is watching the Facebook page.
Please pass on greetings and tell them it is very interesting for us to read the news.
They talked about people of Romanian nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if the child comes and the parents are not at all able to understand Czech, then after work I can help them by phone.
I need to change my bed linen, 2 sets.
This is what I like about holidays.
I have free time, and we only go to the Easter service.
Thank you today for writing down your data for work
The data was very interesting, thank you for the organization
In Nestor, only a sniffle, and in Galinka, 37.7 degrees in the evening.
There is a long queue for General Chapek.
Everyone has a chance.
The main thing is that love is real and mutual.
I don't know how it is in Europe, but in our country people get married for various reasons, primarily mercenary and commercial ones.
And for me this is a problem, if I don't love a person, nothing will come out of it.
For example, we took our grandmother home immediately.
She was very, very grateful, she was crying.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
She had tears in her eyes.
She said if possible there will be some old blankets and pillows.
But that's not necessary. Only if you want. I'm also very grateful to you.
I'm sorry it happened to him.
He killed my best friend.
I had a lot of questions for God as to why things were happening in my life that just made me want to give up on everything.
Do the little grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go away and you made the collection
That's how it is, but we still don't know our way around and don't know where everything is. We spent an hour looking for a supermarket and walked back. Two blankets are not suitable, so two large ones are needed.
I even thought of you today, and you wrote to me.
Does your dad only speak Russian or someone else in the family?
Kids can come to Valy and play in the yard
Well, let's risk it then :)
I am also glad to have met you.
For housing, I talked to Volodymyr. He said that he would call me when he finds something or would look for himself. He also said that there is an institution that helps to find housing.
For the sake of a little one, I'm crossing the barrier.
I didn't know the answers to some of their questions
It was good on Thursday, if possible
I cannot call a doctor because I have not done the food hygiene inspection yet.
But I can't call him because I have no money on my account.
I cannot replenish my phone because I do not understand Czech online banking, and my Ukrainian bank card is not replenished.
In addition, I cannot change the tariff to have normal calls and the Internet to work.
I am going mad
If the price is not right, then the face... The title sounds wrong, what did you mean?
I'm ashamed to sit without work
Just wrote that in school at the lesson
I'm sorry to have bothered you, I was just really
And that's closer to when they'll leave Ukraine to know exactly what they're getting.
But there everything is now under question.
For example, the size of 10-11 years. But our sizes do not coincide. Everything needs to be measured
I am looking for everything for the house and for the child.
Thank you people for accepting me, I live in the chapel, they always ask me if I need anything and I'm ashamed to ask myself.
I just got home, I'm eating lunch now :)
Please don't explain, be kind and do what you can
It is impossible to answer without a resume.
I can't tell my mum!
And to be honest, now I'm feeling a bit lost, that I couldn't hold back my emotions before we left the apartment... Like tonight...
Dear God, let Yura sleep üôè maybe I'll fall asleep too, just for a bit.
I will write to you in any case.
Hello. Susana will help. I received my payment for March. It is for you and me with Julia or just for me, I cannot understand why such a large sum.
For example, you can make copies of passports when it suits you.

I turned to Caritas, who offered me emergency accommodation for a week ‚Äì two nights, but I need somewhere permanent where I can be with my child, and there are fewer and fewer places
The flowers bloomed. Everything is normal. Everyone is rested and very beautiful.
As "European truth" reports, Welt writes with reference to sources in the Ukrainian government.
According to the publication, the proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economic Affairs on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including the training package and spares, amounts to ‚Ç¨170 million.
Howitzers are also offered in the version for the BTR Boxer armoured personnel carrier for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks have to get close to the target in battle, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire over a distance of more than 30 kilometres.
As reported by the Ukrainian government circles with reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will be carried out in a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the gaps that have formed will be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers could be delivered 30 months after the contract is signed, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed until 2027.
And this is in the morning, or in the afternoon?
Thank you, we will find out how to replenish the ranks and mobilize. I will write to you. Thank you.
I go to work without passing the commission tomorrow, and then when my doctor gets better, I will pass the commission, right?
How can I change my T-Mobile package to 4 gigabytes for 249 kroner?
Hello, I'm asking again. Do you need workers?
It can be used to wash floors or dishes.
I'm from Ukraine, unfortunately I don't know the language, but I need the work.
I am young and active, I am 21 years old.
I agree to any work.
I speak Czech at a basic level, but I am learning every day, so I think I am learning everything I need to work without problems
Something I said to you today, you probably need to sleep to work tomorrow

You are smart and everything will be alright üôè Rest, recharge and have a strong sleep! üá∫üá¶üá®üáø
On her birthday, she tried to finish her life by suicide on the Charles Bridge.
Was it possible to make friends with someone?
We wanted to resolve the issue with the card before Easter. We don't have an internet bank - we don't know how to set that up. What do we need to do?
Turning to the Pan who lives with us?
Always say goodbye when you leave
Awash, we can go after 5 p.m.
Can I send my laundry to the apartment tomorrow and hang it to dry in the garage?
Hello. I'll be waiting for you at 6 a.m.
How many studied this specialty
It would be great if it were warm
I applied online. I will try to go after work.
We are all right. With a fireplace, we cope, we have experience, we have gas in Ukraine, but it is very expensive, so we burn firewood.
Good day, Lena, could you please tell me where the nearest store with stationery is located?
We're going to Prague tomorrow to see the apartment
It all just happened
I have to take Karinka with me
I put on my pantyhose, came home, and translated what it said on the chair near the door to the cleaner's channel, you can clean or you can turn off the vacuum cleaner
Writes that my status will change in 24 hours. But why? What's the joke?
The ex-husband can't get to sleep, so I'm writing a poem (a real drama).
I want everything that officially connects us to end as soon as possibleüôè
Thank you because something is not quite right here
And even already have the product from ash
Sorry, I got confused.
I didn't understand Czech that well back then.
Probably I thought of something.
They go to school honestly, the three of them, because Galya and Svyatoslav are studying remotely and will finish school in Ukraine and receive certificates of completion in the autumn.
How do I get to the city center?
I share with you my thoughts.
For me, marriage is a mystery between two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A man and a woman themselves decide issues in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time for us to be together.
Why not give it a try?
I rented a car for 9 people, we are coming with Mariana and your family.
How much time do you have? At what time do you have to leave?
So, I'm glad to listen to jazz.
Thanks to this app, I work for it on Wednesdays at the Czech course
For the last four years I haven't let anyone get close to me, I've read a lot of books on philosophy and introspection.
When it hurts too much, it's hard to trust.
But you need to try again, everyone goes through something that changes them forever, it's life.
Martin, we are going to sleep.
Thank you for such a wonderful and cheerful day.
We all really liked it.
We feel like we're in our family.
The kids told their dads, all their grandmas and grandpas how it was nice there.
Happy holidays, girls! Best wishes from us üòâ
And we are looking at it now
I hope that the son will come out alive from this meat grinder.
Let's go today, maybe something will be needed.
How do you connect with them to get them to open the door?
Is there an improvement in overcoming the coronavirus?
Thank you for helping people. If you can, help us too. Find affordable housing.
We are at Slapi, our friends took us in for the time being.
My family: husband, 6-year-old daughter, 11-year-old son.
The man has already found a job as a driver.
I am a masseur, a rehabilitologist, and I am looking for work.
In order for the kids to go to school and for me to work, we need to live close to civilization.

Lydia has already been taken to school, but because of the illness, we will go to the teacher on Tuesday, the teacher told me today.
I'm sitting here with headphones on, listening to music and thinking about you and the children.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, darling, how about you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I approach it like this: we are together. We are a couple.
I would say that after the war there will be a lot of work.
So I'm not afraid that I won't find her there.
I know a lot.
So I'm not afraid that I didn't get into any of them.
I don't know how it will be with housing.üò¢üò¢üôè
I need to undergo an inspection for a food licence. Can you do that for me?
Could you please tell me what to cook for five guests tomorrow, please?
Fifth place in the room with a TV?
Unfold and cover the sofa?
Can we stop with you until Ms Margarita finds us an apartment?
Don't worry about it.
Not new, already used, but it works, but not necessary.
Write the address in Czech, and we'll see where it is on the map.
I don't know how many free places there are there so I can't plan anything with furniture I want to see that apartment this week and finally understand what furniture I need
I'm sorry it took me so long to respond, I was at work all day and it's hard to adapt.
Is this enough?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you and have the chance to hold you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how you look.
For the child there is a bed and a bath, things have been found for the first time
Don't forget that you promised to help me as soon as you can, but not the last thing to give üòâüôÉ
I want to make a haircut which is called a cap
Oleg got sick - fever and cough. It's better not to take Yana with you, so as not to infect him.
I'll be a little later - around 8. Can you?
I don't want misunderstandings with you
But do I worry that everything is going to be alright?
But we didn't even talk about these excursions!
I understand how important this is to you!
As for me, I am speechless (for me this is just the peak I cannot reach)!
How do you feel today? üòÖ after the celebration?
Hello, sorry, I just woke up, I'm still sleepy
Think about it.
I was upset that we started the test with Cole poorly yesterday.
I will ask either Grigory Denisenko or Yonashuk (Yanashuk) whether they can help me with some mathematical concepts.
Could I be of any use to them?
If there is such an opportunity, I want to draw mathematical terms during the weekend.
Geometry in general is a difficult subject, but we have to work with the Colleagues so that there are no mistakes.
Thank you for the test tasks
We also hope for that
And so she is very happy with any present
Yab wanted to connect the internet to her Czech number
Yesterday, on the 402 bus stop, I met a Ukrainian girl - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and anger...
I couldn't stay out of it.
Now we have agreed that we will be friends.
And last night, thanking God for this girl, because it's the first person from Ukraine who felt my heart in return.
The branch in hall No. 29 is designed specifically for the submission and processing of applications for assistance
It turned out that I had ordered a reserve map.
It's not worth being a simple person
So she would not be frightened that no one came
I didn't go out. I just stayed at home. I can do it. The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the stove.
So you're leaving the city for a long time?
A year and a half ago in the Memorial Center of the Holocaust "Babi Yar" in Kyiv we commemorated the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babi Yar.
I had the honor to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke about "a common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in territorial integrity, peaceful and safe Europe.
We must protect this foundation - it is also part of our responsibility towards our history."
If "the demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us, the Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight must go on.
Today, Russia attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of peaceful civilians, starving the inhabitants of the blockaded cities to death, and letting them die from diseases.
Russian troops are carrying out mass shootings of Ukrainians, and even visually it recalls Babi Yar.
For over a month Germans have seen this in the news in real time.
For example, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, and arms that were unthinkable not so long ago.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means more than just protesting against the swastika.
This means fighting all possible ways against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
There is no easy path without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you
We agree, let's agree on the excursion and write when we are gathered
Everyone was sick, but Lydia was not sick. There was a new type of cough.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I use this ticket instead of a card
Ring for late documents.
The ticket cost me 2000 hryvnias from the driver
Sergiy Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO is no longer a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO, and only 18% of those polled were "for".
After the Revolution of Dignity, Viktor Yanukovych's flight, annexation of Crimea and the start of the Donbass war, the number of opponents of NATO began to fall, while supporters, on the contrary, began to grow.
After the start of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - over 75%.
Despite the support of Ukraine's joining NATO and the alliance's assistance in wartime, there is now a lot of criticism of the alliance and its members - for inadequate supply of weapons, refusal to close the sky, unwillingness to "irritate" Russia.
In addition, there is a big risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up its aspiration to join the alliance because of the position of Russia, if this can stop the war and Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In a new episode of the podcast "The Fateful Questions", together with the editor-in-chief of "European Truth", we talk about how the Alliance has actually helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, why NATO should not be criticized for this, and why the Alliance is criticised in vain, why our perspective of joining NATO is closer now than ever before, why security guarantees discussed in negotiations with Russia may become the second Budapest Memorandum, and much more.
What do you think is going on here?
My partner and I are at 100 volts.
I sent it through this mobile app
There are no visas, we have to go to the congress center and find out how to do it, because it was organized in Poland, where visas were not given, but a voucher was issued.
You must write to us!
Denis left today in a good mood.
He agreed to meet the boy from Ukraine, whom he met yesterday, near the school so that he could show him everything.
So I hope everything is all right with him
But that's how I am, I don't like it for long
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent tanks T-72 and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine
I leave the children there and wait for 3-4 years and go home because I can't leave.
And take it at 6-7 a.m.
There was a sick heart.
I had real feelings for this man but he didn't behave very well and I left him.
After a while he came back and asked for my forgiveness.
I refused him.
Then, a few hours later, he called to say he was having heart surgery.
I asked him to just talk to me and it became his fault.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
We talked a lot during this time.
I had problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at that time.
This mutual help.
And I thought, perhaps it really is necessary to look at it in a different way.
And he proposed to me, and two days later he died.
So God himself decided our fate.
What does it mean to be ready to get married for you?
And he only speaks Czech
I wanted to say that I found an apartment and I'm really happy about that üòä now I have a place to live and a place to be with the kid.
Did I need to remind you earlier?

You lifted my mood
Well, let's talk about something else, because I can't sleep and I keep having nightmares...
God is never late, in everything His time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I fully understand the value of unqualified work, and I understand that I will not be able to have a job like the one I had in Kiev here, and the money I earned at home I will not be earning here now.
But I can't just sit and do nothing because then all the bad thoughts come into my head and I need to keep myself occupied with something physical
Documents are processed at the airport from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., at other times you can just wait.

But I make it complicated.
Ok, write me when it will be convenient üòò
I don't know how to work. I would like, of course, if I put children in kindergarten and school
We planned it that way. Is it better if we change things up sometimes?
I'm sorry. I don't have any missed calls from the middle of the day. Excuse me, can we arrange another term?
I offer cleaning the bathroom and toilet, washing 3 windows, and dusting.
The work will take about 3-4 hours. The sum is 800 hryvnias one-time. From April 19, Wednesday, from 2 p.m.

Could you please tell me, do you have any approximate schedule for cleaning your apartment a month ahead, even approximately which days?
I don't remember this schedule )
Russian army threatens to strike Kyiv with missiles: "Never done this before"
Direct words by Konashenkov: "We see attempts at diversion and strikes by Ukrainian forces against targets in the territory of Russia.
If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike at the centers of decision-making, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army previously refrained."
The Russians launched rocket attacks on Kyiv from the first days of the full-scale invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles, which were shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system, fell on a multifamily house in the capital's Petrivka district.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a multi-story building on Valeriya Lobanovsky Prospekt.
On March 1, Russians hit the TV mast on the outskirts of Donetsk, near Baby Yar, killing five passersby.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian rockets flying in the direction of the building of the Ministry of Defense at the South Railway Station.
On March 14, the fragments of the rocket shot down by the occupants exploded a house and a trolleybus in Kyiv's Kurenivka
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential area in Vinnitsa, killing one person and wounding 19, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center in Vinnitsa, resulting in the death of at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko once again stated on April 13 that residents of the capital who were evacuated from the city should not yet return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still launch rocket attacks on Kiev, and besides that, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ammunition in the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine warned on 12 April that the Russians were planning a number of terrorist attacks in Russian territory in order to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army towards the civilian population.
On April 1 near Belgorod in Russia, an oil depot exploded, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, local authorities in Belgorod announced that a "Ukrainian missile" had fallen not far from the city.
Obviously, the elites in Washington and Berlin are throwing cold water on the very idea that the people's militias will be shooting down Russian bombers over Ukraine.
But Zelensky is talking less to them and more to their voters and societies overall.
In his speeches to parliaments and to the massed crowds on the squares of Europe's greatest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that has been beyond the reach of all his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces European nations that elect these politicians.
And these speeches, this refined blend of strength and tenderness, of passion and restraint, are slowly working their magic.
While Biden categorically opposes the closure of the airport, 70% of his compatriots already support this idea.
Although Paris and Brussels are against accelerating Ukraine's entry, the process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want you to think we're frauds.
The money you raise will be better spent on those who need it more.
I can come to you and we'll sort it out there. I'm here to help you
But the air is clean, which is a plus.

You didn't want me to write today... for some reason
Don't worry, I didn't come for anything.
More precisely - I ask for your attention today.
I want to say a lot today, so I ask for your patience.
Is everything okay with you?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan purchases, holidays.
You have a dream.
You were planning on buying that dress, the one you saw yesterday at the shopping centre.
Tomorrow evening, after work.
Your brain cannot process this.
He clings to the old reality.
If you call in, you'll find out if you're working today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There is hope... this too shall pass.
Now ... to agree ... something will be.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go? I have nobody and nowhere.
I've got $50 in my pocket. Everything we spent at home.
Many of our leaders did not pay us a salary.
Where should I go? Who do I need? How do I provide for my children? Where should I live?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything from home... you're going to have to drive 1000 kilometres.
You don't know if there will be anything to feed them with tomorrow, or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children all over Prague.
What next? We don't know. How many? We don't know. The children ask for sweets. And you can't. It's too expensive for you.
And with every thug - we do not have such people.
The choice is to stay there and risk the children or try to escape.
She was very happy with the hearts and things that the children gave her when she came to school

I don't know exactly, because I'm not very oriented in the city... around half past 12.
What services/activities, in your opinion, are needed/missing for the elderly?
I don't know because there was no SMS from the bank and I didn't take the bank card and the children deleted the bank application and they really upset me
Could you please tell me how to get there, please?
Today we are happy - our city of Bucha has been liberated from the occupiers, and our troops have advanced.
The cleanup from the enemy is underway - looking for Russians in the basements and apartments.

Diano, as you want. I don't know if he will be embarrassed.
Panas wants to stay at home, saying he's tired of us and wants to be alone while we're gone.

These are small businessmen who opened volunteer headquarters in their premises and shops.
These are tractor drivers who actually go out into the field under fire, because it's time to plant.
These are bus drivers who have agreed to go to the occupied territories in convoys today to bring aid there and to evacuate people.
These are heroic conductors who drive into the zone of combat without fear, comfort and help the refugees in the carriages, and help volunteers load humanitarian aid into the carriages at peaceful stations.
These are petrol station attendants who stood on the highway in the first days of the war and patiently served scared and nervous people.
These are the communal workers who remove the garbage under fire, repair water pipes and power lines so people can live normally.
These are doctors and nurses who work 24 hours a day to save people, never complaining, and devote their free time to collecting medicines for the front.
In Ukraine, the juice stops flowing when there are only a few drops left)

My daughter is 8 years old, is that a suitable age?
I am looking for accommodation for us for 3-4 days when we come to the Czech Republic to deliver passports for visa application to Canada.
In Warsaw there are a lot of people in the visa centre and the on-line queue doesn't work.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far away, the train ride takes a lot of time, and it will be hard for the child.
So she decided to look for an apartment in Prague or in its vicinity.
No, we like it
Yesterday's instruments

Gryshko is still sleeping, crying a lot during the night, biting his nails.
I'm calling everyone I know in Lviv right now, many people have died.
The Czech Republic started issuing visas after March 22, I believe.
Until that time - put stamps like that and then equated these stamps to visas
The overseas electoral district of Ukraine (OVV Ukraine) is an electoral district that brings together the polling stations located outside Ukraine, and consists of the premises for voting in the embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises on military bases abroad,[1] where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents are stationed (Kosovo and the DRC).[1] The role of the district election commission for the Overseas Electoral District is fulfilled by the Central Election Commission.
Only nationwide elections are held in the overseas electoral district: presidential and parliamentary elections and nationwide referendums.

You said that your washing machine is broken. Take it for yourself. You need it too.

Well, maybe after Easter
Yesterday your mother said that you were in pain?
She can't tell them everything she wants, and she doesn't always understand what they're saying (but she came in yesterday with a lovely attitude after that market.
She also went to school today.
Today I saw Christina's mother, but she didn't even say hello (
Very tasty apples, what kind is it?
Office of the President head Andriy Yermak announced that Russia has started a "fake operation" to supply weapons to us via allies.
Direct words of Yermak: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their backwardness, and seek in any way to "block" arms supplies.
For example, one of the latest fakes - the alleged destruction of the S-300 missile systems delivered to Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What's next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. The name of one of them.
They can launch fake stories that Ukrainian soldiers surrender with weapons in hand, and they massively switch to the Russian army.
I want to immediately dispel such rumors.
But the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively send the enemy to that world.
Could you please excuse me, I forgot to ask how much it costs a month and if it will work in the summer?
Everyone gets what they deserve.
There are much more dubious histories, it seems.
It means that I had to go through these events to change myself.

I'm sorry, but I can't count on anyone in this life.
I was offered a job every day today.
I'm sorry, but I agreed to work there.
Thank you for your response and best of luck in finding a great assistant!
Maybe your dad told you that there are witnesses of God among us, but I do not practice any religion.
However, she was christened in a Catholic church.
I respect all religions, the basis of which is love.
I read the Bible, the Koran, and started reading the Torah.
I believe that there are no intermediaries between man and God.

I can't contact you only by e-mail, I'm sorry, but nothing comes out of me, which is closer to Czech Krumlov, where we work in Czech Krumlov, and now we live in Prague.
I can't help you then. There is no chance in Brno. The nearest last apartment in P≈ô√≠ƒçina
Thank you for your help, we found an apartment, but we need a bed and a sofa, possibly you can advise where we can buy them not too expensively, because our budget is weak, thank you very much.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged of Russian forces committing atrocities against the civilian population of Ukraine, with Moscow dismissing the claims as a "provocation."
‚ÄúReports of the killing, rape and torture of Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops are worthy of condemnation,‚Äù New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told journalists in Wellington on April 4.
Russia "has to answer for what they did to the world," she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its battle against Russian aggression.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called the incidents a "violation of international law."
The announcements came as reports emerged of the killing of scores of peaceful civilians being shot and dumped in mass graves or left lying in the streets of the capital's suburbs, by Russian troops who have now withdrawn from the area after occupying it for several weeks.
Photos purportedly showing the bodies of civilian with bound hands shocked many and led to calls to step up sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on 4 April that there were signs that Russian forces had committed "war crimes" in Buyuk.
What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures, said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that Russian troops could go so far as to commit "genocide" in Bucha.
We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusation as a "provocation."
Without evidence, she claimed that the United States and NATO had "ordered" the images to discredit Russia.
In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first hours after the emergence of these materials does not create any doubts about who "ordered" this story, "said Zakharova.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defence also made the claim without evidence that the image of Bukchah was "yet another staged event by the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow has requested the U.N. Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a "provocation" by Ukrainian radicals in the town of Bucha.
The Russian Investigative Committee on April 4 made public a statement announcing a "preliminary investigation" on charges of spreading "knowingly false information" on the actions of the Russian troops in Bakhchysarai.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the nation on April 3, accusing Russian forces of committing "genocide" in the city and telling Moscow's leaders they needed to travel to Bucha to see what their troops had done.
I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are executed," Zelensky said in a video address switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For shots in the face," he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and their heads cut off, I don't understand what's going on,' he said referring to the scenes of the victims strewn across the streets of Burchi, a town some 35 kilometres north-west of Kiev.
A correspondent for the Ukrainian Service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty saw the bodies of what appeared to be civilians in the streets of a small town on April 2.
Only one correspondent saw 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various locations in Buhaya.
The bodies of nine people - all civilians - were scattered over land near the site, which local residents say was used by Russian forces as a base.
It appears the victims were shot at close range.
Ukrainian authorities have said that the bodies of at least 410 civilian have been found in the area of Kyiv which was controlled by Russian forces a week ago.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
They were told: "Kiev doesn't exist." How occupants cruelly smuggled Ukrainians into Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
There is another point in this list, about which there is significantly less information - the evacuation of local population to the territory of the enemy.
Around mid-March, Russian occupants "evacuate" Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements on their territory and that of Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko effectively handed over to the Russian military training ground.
"Ukrainska Pravda" tracked down and interviewed the Ukrainians and their relatives who were deported in order to find out what is happening with the "evacuation" itself, and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to the forced evacuation out of Ukraine under psychological pressure and out of desperation.
Thankfully, they are alive and in contact with their families.
However, given the statements by the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were forcibly transported to Russia and Belarus.
In Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the personnel of the second maternity hospital, took children from there without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian champion swimmer Yosyp Zatsypinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Valya moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander got a job at the "Antonov" airport, located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
Like true plastunts, Denys and Marina had prepared three backpacks in advance, but on February 24, they did not have time to evacuate.
There were no cars in them, and suburban buses were already full.
Around midday on February 24, they saw helicopters with the V letter, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit the neighbouring house.
The family went downstairs and stayed there for weeks, until the 17th of March, while the Russian military evacuated them to Belarus.
A total of around 40 people were hidden in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
At 6 p.m. on February 24, people came to the yard who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
Ask: "Is there anyone?" - I say that. - "Get out!"
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there was weapons.
All the men were asked if they served in the army.
Women were told: "We have come to protect you at the request of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was the Chechen OMON, even not the troops, young guys of 25-35 years old.
They said: "We are at war with the Ukrainians, Sashko Bilyi (commander of the nationalist UNA-UNSO "Viking" battalion, who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what was missing.
We say that the water was a big problem.
They smashed the shop window, helped themselves under the guise of "Russia will take it anyway" and brought us six bottles.
There are also videos online where children thank Kadyrov for the food.
So, after looting the shop, they brought the meat and said: "We know it's wrong, but we need the video for Ramzan Ahmatovich."
Nobody wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful break.
Our child says to them: 'You have seven days to return our phones,'" they laughed.
And they constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said that it was good that they had come, because they did not want the war, and the Ukrainians support them and are even good people: "Putin is a scoundrel, and so is Kadyrov, but we can do nothing, because our families are there.
And mostly they didn't fight, but rode around to rob shops and steal.
They brought the chicken, tied one end of the Georgian ribbon to one leg, and the other ‚Äì to the other leg, and called her "volunteer".
They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten in Bucha, so badly that they didn't even take away the dead, they asked us: "Do you have any artillery?"
In addition, we had detachments ‚Äì the Chechens did not know one another, in the first days they asked passwords to find out who was who.
They were with us until the 13th of March, after which the Russian OMON came, and then the Moscow paratroopers.
They put 30-40 units of equipment between the houses - and ours kept getting caught in it with the "Bayraktars."
But they came and told us that the ZSU is no more, but there is the "Azov" and, according to them, there are thousands of them in Ukraine.
The narrative of "Kiev already surrendered" has been pushed since the beginning of March.
Somehow a Russian - either an officer of the landing force or a representative of the FSB - came to us and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio - they were talking about Bucha, Hostomel, thought maybe we'd get the "green corridor".
We handed over our lists to the Chechens at the start, and they promised to liaise with the Ukrainian command.
But they say to us, "You're being taken to Belarus, and then, maybe, to Rostov."
We are saying that we don't want to go there or there.
To which they replied: "Well, fuck your children's psyches!"
How it worked: They would push us into the basement and start shooting from under the house - either with grenades or machine guns.
And then it came back... Neighboring houses simply burned, part of them collapsed.
Our house received a direct hit on the third floor.
They later agreed to take us to Belarus, pledging to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some didn't go, saying it was for traitors - "they'll shoot you there, and sell your organs".
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burning pits, machinery was wrecked, although the Belorussians said the Russians took their machinery away straight away.
A lot of cannons, buried technology and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Koyar" we passed an improvised control, many people were without documents because they had burned.
We were placed in tents by the Red Cross and given tea.
And here we hear shots! The rocket is fired, and we can see the trail - "Iskander" worked on Kiev.
Although the Red Cross in Belarus said: "No, the planes are flying and turning at the border."
But we are aviation, we have education, we understand that.
We were then loaded onto a bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.
His boss, Vyacheslav Vasilyevich, arrived and said: "Here's the joke, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Mr Putin and Mr Lukashenko will not stop until these criminals are brought to justice.
The poor people suffer!
And we have such a good Luka!
As he said, so shall it be.
They offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but nobody wanted to.
The sanatorium administration told us: "You are traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and UNHCR (that's what they called themselves, at least) were spreading disinformation that the men couldn't come to Poland.
Many believed it and stayed away from Belarus.
But we decided to go anyway, even though we had a problem with documents - our daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We had him on Monday to receive him, and the war began on Thursday.
The Ukrainian consulate didn't help us, and at the train station in Minsk they said that no one will take anyone anywhere without a passport.
I would like to say that the Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were moved to Minsk and were accompanied.
The sanatorium was not under control.
Our second group of migrants was told by a migration official that they could stay in the country for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not in Europe, and there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
Driving by Mozirya (around 50 kilometres from the Ukrainian border - UA), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles over Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then fades.
People who got on the bus in Mozir said the Russians were constantly shooting from the polygon.
But I can say that Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are being released from the army.
One woman told us that if her son is called, she breaks something.
However, the north of Belarus, where Minsk is, altogether do not believe.
They say: "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
They do not accept that their ranges are used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland, we were waiting for friends who brought us to Estonia.
Now we are registering, and we are deciding what to do next.
In Estonia, there are as many Ukrainian flags as there are Estonian ones.
Marina lived on the territory of the military town in Hostomel together with her brother's family - his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to gather the most essential things and documents.
In the evening, they went to sleep in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself cannot return home and will not be able to - there is no home to return to.
Nobody knew anything about the evacuation.
And on Monday somewhere in the centre you won't be able to?
Thank you, it's all here. And you are always welcome!
Thank you for the agreement, the motels are great
And in this little apartment, there's no Wi-Fi, and I don't know how to be? And the children have online classes on Monday, and there's no internet.
So I will live with two women from Ukraine and their children? Is this family ready to accept us?

Can we agree on how to do it better?
On 1 April, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, announced the joyful news that the Ukrainian military had liberated the city from Russian invaders on 31 March.
The next day, the occupants were thrown out of all of Kyiv Oblast.
But the joy that Ukrainians would have felt at this moment was dimmed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that the Russians had shot dead at least 280 peaceful residents in just one town, Bucha.
They were just killed on the street, some had their hands tied behind their back and were shot in the forehead, some of the killed were minors.
The bodies of Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and their son Alexander, who were abducted on 23 March, were found with signs of torture.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were buried in a common grave, while Igor was found in a sewer.
Bodies of several naked women, wrapped in carpets, have been found 20 km away from Kiev.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, no one will be at home
I ordered a parcel from Germany using DHL.
They were supposed to deliver it to me yesterday, but no one contacted me and the shipment was not delivered, and on the DHL website it says that the recipient could not be found.
Therefore, the letter was sent to the post and the address of this department was indicated.

I was there every day, several times a day, when I was small, because the river was just behind the house, and it was very close, but I don't go there very often now, because I don't have time, and sometimes I don't feel like it, but I go with my sister)

President Volodymyr Zelensky said some types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European truth."
All the equipment, all that they have already sent, for some types of equipment this has been done too late.
So, when we talk about, for example, Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and now what?
I see 100-percent support from leaders of some countries, which is really so.
Some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
When asked if Ukraine had enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied, "Not yet, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, there would be no war, or it would have a different appearance.
It would have developed differently, we would have had the support of our neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I am convinced that there would have been no war," he added.
Remember, the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I dream that the war will end and we will return home

And they kept me in the house, then they took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people there, about 400 people, and there was no air to breathe.
And what about housing, which you have photographed?
I have not got there yet
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already denied this fake.
The last two videos amaze me when the Internet will work normally

Well, he'll come there and take them away.
I am not greedy
I understand that I cannot sit in you and I need to work
I understand. Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 and Ukrainian television in general.
I see all the news online.
And 1+1 is a pro-presidential, propaganda channel, which is not interesting to me at all
What happened there at the stop with the man, did the police and ambulance come? Is everything all right with him?
Diana didn't answer me and you

In this case, I know a girl who is Ukrainian but is studying in the Czech Republic in tourism.
You really don't want to come for a minute with the kids quietly and with grandma.
I want you to be with me. Sleep next to me.
In general, it's hard to live in a foreign country, and every day you want to go home more and more.
Ms Agata, if you need a photo, I'll take one.
Thank you for trying to make our lives here as comfortable as possible.

I can't believe how much I use it.
And how do I pay?
I tell her that 'repairing the television and radio' has been held up by import parts, and I've warned friends and acquaintances not to call unless it's urgent.
We've been hiding the truth about the war from grandmother for a whole month.
For now it is possible.
However, Plymki's (kitten - UA) tail and hind legs are covered in fur - this could be stress, dietary changes and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but unfortunately, stress does not depend on me.
Plamka, unlike the grandmother, is not deaf, she hears sirens and explosions."
Thanks to the fact that Olga is hard of hearing and spends most of her time in her room, her niece had been living with her "incognito" for a month.
On 1 April, 93-year-old Oksana Polova picked up a gun for the first time in her life.
I lived with her as a partisan for 33 days.
They hid the war from her, and the fact that I was there - formally came for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend started talking, I gave her the receiver - she listened for four hours, then sang for two hours."
The radio receiver was always by the bed.
Most of the time the grandmother spends in her room.
Hearing is bad - it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "walkers," I hid in my room.
First of all, she hid the receiver and the television set.
Then she called everyone she knows. Six or seven people.
She asked to talk about anything but the war.
I asked my girlfriend, she was there from the start and to the end
I do my cleaning on April 17 - two flats :)
Good evening, I did not think about this at all :)

The Briton, who was defending Mariupol in the ranks of the ZSU, says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
A Briton, a soldier in the Ukrainian Marine Corps which is defending Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Edwin Eriksson, a British soldier who has served with the Ukrainian Armed Forces since 2018, with reference to members of his family and friends, Atlas News with reference to a friend of Eriksson who spoke to him
Literally tweeted by Eslin: "We got the message from him: "It's been 48 days, we tried everything possible to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you everyone, I hope the war will soon end."
Details: Eislin served in the 36th separate marine infantry brigade of the ZSU, which is taking part in the defensive operation of Mariupol.
The journalist from the BBC contacted the mother of the serviceman, En Woo, and she confirmed that her son told her over the phone that they were planning to surrender.
Another military friend, Breanne Fitts, also confirmed to journalists that in their last phone call, ISIS said they planned to surrender.
According to him, ammunition and food ran out in the brigade.
Journalists from the Atlas News outlet contacted his friend, who said that the Eslines unit intended to surrender to the Russians in order to avoid falling into the hands of the so-called "Kadyrovtsy" militias without weapons and ammunition.
Social media was also used to spread an audio recording of a telephone conversation in which it appears that Eislin is talking to an American friend who is planning to travel to Ukraine.
In the interview, Eislin said they tried to leave the city in civilian clothes, but were unsuccessful.
Earlier, the Briton told how in Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company "Wagner".
Elsie was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, but between 2015 and 2017 he travelled to Syria to fight against terrorists with the so-called Islamic State.
In 2018 he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and took an oath.
Her friends and family called her Johnnie, but online she was better known by her nickname Cossack Gundi.

I ask the man in the morning if he slept well.
When you come home, write me, please, if it's not too much trouble, I need to talk to Daniel.
The attacking Bolsheviks recovered from their losses in the battle.
Teacher Dmytro Pavlychko, his unknown relative, and teenager Boris Oleksiyenko were shot dead.
Their bodies were thrown into a "deep pit and covered with earth."
According to memories, "there was a dead silence in the city."
Rarely, someone from the residents passed by the houses.
The bodies of those executed by the Bolsheviks were encountered on the streets constantly
And I, perhaps, will go with you. You need me. I cannot do without you.
3. What is your own activity/activity that helped you or your friends better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?

I want to be able to repay everyone who helped us, because it was our last hope, and it worked.
I am not afraid of work, because I also lived in the village, so I can work physically.

It's a very interesting tradition for you, it's how we celebrate Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted the draft law 7176, entitled "On the implementation of monitoring potential threats to national security in the field of economy."
It is strange that in fact the only potential threat to national security in the sphere of the economy turned out to be... the place where members of the supervisory boards of state-owned companies and banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill consider that the adoption of decisions by the supervisory board of the state company in the simulated Kyiv may somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of the large number of new risks for state-owned companies, but we do not know of any company that has had to physically hold board meetings at the site of its location.
The potential threat of such a law is clear - it is a wonderful base for "wiping out" all achievements in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing a manual of control.
As it was until 2015.
Why should state-owned companies have supervisory boards and who should be on them?
Moreover, if one harmful draft law "takes off" under the slogans of patriotism, then others may take off tomorrow ‚Äì for example, the system of state procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
A lot can be attributed to the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the beginning of the war and the draft law 7176.
This norm was introduced into the bill's comparative table on February 22.
And in general, the desire to dismantle supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some popularly elected officials for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the draft law, we will dismantle the arguments explaining the need for its adoption.
And then we will offer our proposals on how to manage state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economic Development Denis Kudrin explained the necessity of such innovation risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will prevent remote work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to take the necessary decisions, which may paralyze the company's work.
We agree that such a risk exists, but will he be able to prevent the transfer of members of supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a fairly cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (who constitute the majority of the entire composition) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be released.
And that, in turn, is likely to lead to the loss of the quorum needed for the supervisory board to take any decisions.
Instead, quickly appointing new independent members of the supervisory board will not work, as the law stipulates that a competitive selection process must be held, which typically takes 3-4 months.
Therefore, the proposed draft law 7176 is likely to deprive the supervisory board of the possibility of taking decisions, rather than protecting it!
People's Deputy, author of the bill Dmytro Naluhka gives other arguments in its support.
For example, he says: "Many companies, including the defence industrial complex (DIG), are currently relocating" and so "it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information via Zoom from Vienna".
To begin with, there are virtually no state-owned enterprises in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
The supervisory board is only in "Ukroboronprom", which in essence is managing almost all state-owned enterprises of the OPK.
But even in the "Ukroboronprom," according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a voluntary basis.
All the power in "Ukroboronprom" belongs to the general director, who incidentally will take a decision on the necessity of relocating some enterprise of the OPK that is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not withstand criticism, because the draft law 7176 does not introduce any changes to the legislation that regulates the activities of state-owned enterprises of the OPK.
Mr. Dmytro, on his Facebook page, also presents arguments that can be categorized as "emotional."
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing in common with increasing the efficiency of state companies and banks, but let's try to disassemble some of them: "serious foreign experts, upon hearing the word "war", leave Ukraine in 2021, but at the same time remain members of the supervisory boards of state-owned enterprises in Ukraine with a full salary of several tens of thousands of hryvnias, while Ukraine is actually suffering from war."
First, this is manipulation - most of such members of supervisory boards never lived in Ukraine and visited it only sporadically.
Therefore, to say that they are "leaving Ukraine" is, to put it mildly, unfair.
Second, as a result of the pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long been resorting to the practice of holding online meetings.
This instrument is widely used in the practice of the world, in absolutely different spheres: business, education, medicine, etc.
It is also not worth forgetting that membership of the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other interests and the means of electronic communication help them in this.
Third, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
It is interesting why Mr. Dmytro does not make identical claims against members of the supervisory board who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are not found where their companies are located.
To the word, it is far from the first populist attempt of deputies to cleanse the supervisory boards of foreigners, and the war is only a new convenient occasion.

We usually need a passport from one of the adults.
In the Boryspil, Vasylkivsky and Bucha districts of the Kyiv region, which have been liberated from the occupiers, a strengthened curfew will be introduced for two days.
Direct words by Pavlyuk: "In the populated localities of Bovary, Vishgorodsky and Buchansky districts, which were occupied by the Russians and liberated by the Ukrainian forces of defense, the curfew hour is reinforced!
The restrictions will be in place in these cities and villages from 6pm on April 2 to 6am on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the regional VA, at this time it is categorically forbidden to be on the streets of populated localities and in other public places, to move about by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go out on the street during the alarm to take shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression - to clear and mine territories.
Omelyan called on people who have left the area not to return.
The curfew will last from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. across the rest of the Kyiv region.

Serbia's defence budget has been growing in geometric progression for several years.
Over the past six years, Serbia has invested over two billion euros in modernising the army, updating military technology and purchasing modern systems, rising 22 places in the list of the world's most powerful military nations.
After the full-scale aggression of Russia against Ukraine, the Western countries have taken the prediction of possible aggravation in the Balkans quite seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

Soldiers of the regime of Lukashenko arrested three Belarusians, 27 and 28 years old, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signaling system in Osipovichi, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Svoboda" radio, the Human Rights Center "Viasna", the Chief of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by the state news agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruisk were detained with the use of special forces "SOBR" and one was injured.
According to "Viasna", the men resisted arrest and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Another was given medical assistance at the scene.
The head of criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennaid Kazakevich, said that "the actions of terrorism on the railway RB will be harshly suppressed" by law enforcement officers using weapons.
On 6 April it became known that on 30 March the police detained another employee of Belarusian Railways, an employee of the Baranavichy depot of "BGD" and an administrator of thematic resources of "BGD" in "VKontakte" and "Classmates" Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what state is unknown, @belzhd_live reports.
At the end of March, more than 40 railroad workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
A reminder: The formation of the BYpol, announced by the regime of Lukashenko as extremist, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage on the objects of railway transport and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the "Peramoga" plan.
Belarusian "railway partisans" are trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine in this way.
It is known that Russia is shipping troops and equipment through Belarus to fight in Ukraine.

U.S. bans investment in Russia and imposes sanctions on Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is introducing new sanctions against the president's daughters, the largest Russian banks - Alfa Bank and Sberbank, and is banning all new investments in Russia.
This is what the White House website says.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia that is owned by the government, while Alfa-Bank is the country's largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets in the U.S. financial system and bar U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a full ban on new investments in Russia.
To this end, the President of the United States, Joe Biden, has signed a new executive order prohibiting new investments in Russia by US citizens, regardless of their location.
This step is based on the decision of more than 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers, such as law and consulting firms," the White House said.
The third step of new sanctions from the United States were restrictions against large Russian state-owned companies in the critical sector.
This will ban US citizens from operating with these groups and freeze any assets they have in US jurisdiction.
The full list will be published by the Ministry of Finance on Thursday.
And the final part of the package is the full freezing of the assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of the foreign minister Lavrov, and members of the Russian Security Council, including ex-president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev and prime minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze any assets they have in the United States.

You can call the school, Kira doesn't answer the phone, doesn't reply, I don't know if she got to school.
They isolate the Russian office: stopping investment and cutting off supplies.
But we didn't understand each other.
There were no military in our house.
Our house is located near a military unit and an oil base
He just helped me because I couldn't have done it on my own.
I cook well, don't ask unnecessary questions and give good advice
I give myself advice.
It's hard for me, but I understand I have to go through this stage.
We'll meet in the fourth and I'll tell you everything.
Overall, everything is fine.
How often do you clean?
I clean up every week.
Unfortunately, I do not have a program, but I will try to figure it out.
I wanted to be a teacher
My girls can't move anywhere at the moment so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
If you hear anything about housing, please let me know.
I would be happy to rent a flat with a decent girl.
If you can find out, please let me know.
On their side - not underestimate.
Thank you in advance.
Dear Natalia, 54 years old. Write down the exact address and how much the courses cost
I think it would be better for you to make copies of our passports, they contain all the information.
I didn't change my last name, it's the same as in my birth certificate :)
Good day, Mr. Riarde! I am sorry, I did not see you. I am doing this now and will send it to you immediately.
We are going to the medical commission now
In other words, Ani needs to work this hour at another day.
On which day should she come earlier? (Is there a day with more work?)
I'll listen tomorrow, the Internet is not working well. Good night.
You are lucky that you will be doing
Thank you ... a little found with things, but nothing with the technology ...
Both beginners, we know nothing but the alphabet
Nothing happens.
Is it possible on Monday 25.04.?
You can take children with you, and there are enough toys here :)
Knew about the Tat
I'm either very naive or very in love, but I'm coming up with something with these dollars.
We will do it somehow.
But how it will be paid for, please, no loans.
Write to me directly and I'll help.
We are your partner, or we are not your partner.
I don't even know.
Do you have to take that clothing with you?
Today is not my day. The curtains in the living room are broken. Morning one. Now evening another
Something from you came, I don't see what
I am also very sad
I'll remind you about the facts later
Does your dad only speak and understand Russian?
What day does your colleague want to do the cleaning and how many windows does the house have?
I'm sorry to have distracted you from your work
Good evening, I can't not share with you. There's a message from Mariupol for his son - he's alive and in service.
Reading Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts experiments on the impact of external factors and the formation of new neural connections
The journalist of the "1+1" TV channel Nataliya Nagornaya published the video recording, which was sent to her by the military of the 36th brigade of marines from Mariupol.
In it, the military says it has run out of weapons for soldiers to fight with and mountains of wounded.
They said "the clock is ticking."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th separate marine brigade, which is defending Mariupol, published an appeal to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not make contact with the fighters for two weeks.
Social media users expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valery Zaluzhny, assured that the connection between the command and the forces of defense in Mariupol is, and details of the defensive operation should not be subject to public discussion.
Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters at the "Azovstal" plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
In the evening of April 11, Russian occupants threw poisonous substance of unknown origin onto Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of the "Azov" battalion, Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the "Azovstal" factory, which is held by the battalion "Azov".
Thank you, I will adjust to you. It would be very good
The situation and it remains so for the time being
2 hours of walking (mom's shopping and back)!
This is not an important matter
She forgot what to do here
The Czechüá®üáø drone squadron has started flying over Ukraineüá∫üá¶ from today.
Almost 50 professional dronesüöÅ will be used for detection, and some of them - for direct destruction of the enemy invaderüí•.
Two Carpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" sent to Ukraine yesterday thanks to the deputy mayor of Mukachevo Vladimir Labutenko.
Today, their inter-mountain friends, headed by the leader of the settlement council and coordinator Vasyl Shcherbak, delivered drones for the purpose: special units of the Ukrainian army received them in various cities where fighting is underway.
In order to use the drones as efficiently and safely as possible, the location of their deployment is currently being kept a secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic are not planning to stop: in the coming days, Ukraine will receive many more interesting "gifts" that will serve to destroy the Russian occupant and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
He didn't care, everything was fine. I love sweet, but I can do without it.
I'm nervous that we won't make it. A lot of baggage.
I will soon return to Ukraine, then work
OK. If everything is all right, I agree
I will do my best, but if there are any problems, I will write to you, if possible?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were personally in the village elder in Yivov, she saw me and that I was pregnant, but said that there was no housing.
Maybe she will be happy and her mood will improve
I had my phone repaired today.
And I think I'm still frozen on the street today.
I drank the pills and tea and felt worse, but not critically.
I also regret it, but it is better to meet when I am healthy.
When you have time, send me music that you like.
I'm curious, what music do you like?
mom and dad have to listen
You'll find him somewhere near the carriage of your little brother.
It was cooler and raining here today. Tomorrow it will be warm.
But it's not the buildings that are destroyed that count, it's the people over whom the occupiers hold sway
In Herson, occupants mocked the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial in Herson on the street of Perekopnytska.
Details: It is indicated that unknown persons pulled down the European Union flag, smashed the panels with photographs of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
Occupants tore down portraits of the Heavenly Hundred and the deceased participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They took down the flag.
Good morning, thank you children for the Christmas carol, we do not have such a custom so we did not know that we did not give the children anything else to eat
If you want to talk to someone, you can.
But I live in a dormitory There will be twelve people here, and then they go to work
Hello is a little better now.
It was clear today.
Even now it is sleeping there.
Therefore, we have already made great strides.
I will definitely bring some vareniki next time!
I don't have the strength to do them today.
As I'm pushing back days and time in which there's work to be done cleaning the flat after guests, I can probably say April month.
In May - I could say at the end of April or in early May.
Just asked if you know anything about it.
Hello, forgive me, that I did not write for a long time, cooked dinner and a little slept.
If you're not against it, I could come today?)
Or we can meet before your arrival)
He is modest with us, he has been learning a lot recently. He realized that this is very important for him in life
Hello) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to be working with people at such a high level.
Today I had a lesson with a woman who is the director of the department of economy of the region of highlands.
She was very pleased with my work.
Gryshko behaved well in custody.
On Monday I will bring confirmation of employment as well as cash payment for the hay.
I'm leaving on Friday.
I do nothing and sleep a lot (and drink a lot of water üòÇ)
If you go to the doctor tomorrow, I will go with you, if possible
I will bring another analysis
So you don't have to go there again.
The downspout is working very poorly, poor drainage. A specialist is needed. It needs to be adjusted.
That's all there is there
Could you please send me the correct email address?
I would like to invite you to the Czech language course you signed up for.
And do they feed the children there or do you have to bring your own?
And now, just one question
If you still need help, write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn't want people to think we were fundraising from the start, so we didn't.
But for online completion, I needed two points:
I'm going to take a nap. To recharge my batteries. Thank you for today's present. Good night.
That's a great idea. I'll have to watch the video now. It will be good because the whole family will be drawing.
Kazan University calls on employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Get your information from official sources.
So you can count on me, thank you!
my other brother who stayed in Ukraine also helps the army
She gathered several works for her portfolio.
After the holidays, the Internet will be available.
I wanted to be your backup designer.
As for me, the day I did not go to work is a day off
Deployment of troops: Russia prepares provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may provoke incidents in the Transnistrian region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against a neighboring state."
Literally: "It is not ruled out that the Russian Federation's armed forces will carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Pridnestrovian region of the Republic of Moldova with the aim of accusing Ukraine of aggression against a neighbouring state."
Details: The opponent continues to create an offensive grouping of forces for actions on the Slobodzhanian direction.
It is likely that the occupants will try to resume the offensive in the near future.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personnel, arms and equipment for participation in combat operations on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are prepared at the 60th separate motorized infantry brigade (Monastyrshchyna) permanent deployment point in the East Military District.
It is likely that the weapons mentioned will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
The 36th Independent Motor Rifle Brigade (Borzya, Zabaykalsky Krai) is also carrying out a recruitment drive within its ranks to replenish losses in personnel.
A special problem arises for the enemy when it comes to supplying drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The withdrawal of the selected personnel is planned for the second half of April this year.
It is possible that the enemy will continue to attack transport infrastructure in Ukraine in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the sites of combat operations, in order to destroy or disrupt them.
Detached units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to fulfill tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in Brest and Gomel regions.
On the Slaviansk direction, separate units of the 6th Army of Ground Troops and the Coastal Fleet of the Northern Fleet continue to partially block the city of Kharkov, and there are artillery attacks on individual districts of the city.
Air reconnaissance of the terrain is underway on the Izium direction in order to detect the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To achieve this, the enemy is using the "Orlan-10" drone.
Using two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to make a breakthrough in the direction of the Dovhenke and Dmytrivka villages, but met with no success and retreated to their former positions.
On the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Lower and Novobakhmutovka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault operations in the Zoloti area, but failed.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupants continue the assault in the areas of the "Azovstal" plant and the sea port.
The enemy carried out artillery attacks on the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of settlements of Vysokopillia, Trudolubivka and Mar‚Äôianske.
Over the past 24 hours, the defenders of Ukraine have repelled four attacks of the enemy in the territory of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, destroyed five tanks, eight armored vehicles, six automotive vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
Don't you understand your thoughts?
We usually try to hurry up, but I doubt
And you, how do you want to sleep, and I will delay you
Do you mind if I come?
If you don't want to see me today, just tell me, I'll understand)
Thank you. We don't watch TV at home and 1+1 even less. We don't need to be set up :)
I turn on the TV exclusively to listen to the Czech language
Today is the last day of my monthly tariff package :)
Can we do this by phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery
I understand that I can prepare materials in this area.
I ask her. I'm a little embarrassed to ask her because she already gives us so many cookies.
We will meet with my father later, of course.
I read the announcement in Facebook, probably Google wrote something about itüèµÔ∏è. I think the number of the phone is enough
Good day, we have things that you brought, but there are things that you can bring to us in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If the director agrees, then I can start going to work from next week, because tomorrow afternoon I am going to go to the employment office to submit documents (if I get there in time, because there are a lot of queues) and on Saturday it's raining :)
I'm looking for a brigade at the start, I really liked chemistry at school, I study Czech to know it perfectly so I can work at Tesla
Old friends and not so old, friends I haven't met personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now you too have come to difficult times.
During the last month, I have spoken to many of you.
Your life, which was never easy, turned upside down, just as the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilt and shame over the actions of your country towards your neighbors.
Because of that, you subject Ukraine to your name.
For some of you, activists, the threat has been hanging over you for a long time, and you have been preparing for the final blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
I'll tell you later, as usual, replied Sasha. Now, after the search, we are walking through the ruins.
Others - cultural figures, artists, critics, writers - were struck by the sudden collapse of your crumbling world.
Nobody here likes Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, and most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: except for a very few of you - those who worked in Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Echo of Moscow, Meduza, Navalny's organisation and in a number of other places - how many of you did anything at all in opposition to this regime?
Apart from taking part in rallies, when they were still taking place.
Read also the column by Russian journalist "Too late to hide, too late to stay silent"
And if so, are you confident that your sense of shame and guilt - is not just an abstraction?
Maybe they are the result of your long indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and passive complicity, which now, no doubt, weigh heavily on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you had a degree of freedom and democracy - lawless, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was not better than 1917.
Why is it that every time a revolution finally happens to you, you end up with such a strong fear of disorder that you are looking for salvation behind the king, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, it still seems safe around him. Why?
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of seizing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the Stasi files, you relegated them to the memory of Dzerzhinsky - and thereby allowed the KGB to lie low, regroup, reform and seize power in the country.
When you were faced with the choice between looting the country and bringing the communists back, you didn't struggle for the possibility of a third option - and meekly accepted the looting.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and that marked the end of mass protests for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then came Mr Putin. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with the terrorists and revive the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you either voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he started again to equate Chechnya with earth, most of you closed your eyes to this.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping the victims of Putin's "anti-terrorist operation" and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Kazar-Yurt, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I returned to Moscow and joked around with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of innocent civilians, the killing of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of their dead to their families.
You said to me: "Get lost, Chechnya bores us." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was outraged: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
It's your country, fuck off, not mine.
I'm just a dumb foreigner here.
This is your government bombing one of your cities and killing your citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know.
Then came the mid-zeroes economic boom, fueled by rising oil prices and Mr Putin's willingness to look the other way as some stolen money stayed in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have become well off, some have got rich, and even the poorest of you have bought new homes and found better jobs.
Prices went up, but so what?
Moscow shone brightly and sparkled from the snow.
When several opponents were killed - Yuri Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others - many of you were shocked and horrified by what was happening.
But that was as far as it went.
When after two terms Putin passed the presidency to Medvedev, and himself became prime minister, you, as I see, barely noticed it.
When, after a few months in power, Medvedev's Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or looked the other way.
I met several of you in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbek or in cafes and Turkish baths in Tbilisi, while your army occupied part of this country?
I would like to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did much, if anything at all.
Some outrage, some sanctions; but what significance did it have that Russia was flouting international law when such a large carrot of Russian oil, gas and domestic market was dangled in front of it?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the hard 1990s, this was the most important.
However, in late 2011, you, my Russian friends, finally woke up.
When Putin again switched places with Medvedev and sat in the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that this was too much and took to the streets in protest.
Mr. Navalny became a byword, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the authorities eventually realized with horror that they were losing ground.
After that, he struck back.
First there were alternative actions, then repressive laws were passed, and the prisons were filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some got huge terms.
What could we do?
I feel this so often and I still hear it.
The state is so strong, and we are so weak.
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Take a look at what they did two years ago.
Infuriated by the pro-Russian president who had betrayed their European hopes, they seized the square just once - and never left it.
They set up the tent camp completely on their own and got ready for a resolute defense.
When the police came and tried to demolish it, they began to defend themselves with pickaxes, iron bars and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, protesters attacked.
Many were killed, but they won.
The fugitive is Yanukovych, and the Ukrainians have regained democracy, the right to freely choose their leaders and kick them out if they do a bad job.
The Maidan was very unpleasant for Putin.
That was a bad example.
So, taking advantage of the general confusion, he seized Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but it had to be done.
And how many of you were thrilled?
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
From nowhere suddenly came a new myth, and a lot of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly turned 180 degrees and started worshipping him.
I find it hard to find a reason because we stopped talking immediately after that.
The rest of those who remained my friends mostly kept quiet.
We are not interested in politics, you said.
And you hide a new one in a book, a movie, an IKEA catalogue and a park, brand new after the restoration the mayor of Moscow started in 2012 - with their binoculars, a general-purpose vodka and hipster cafes.
Indeed, Donbass is far away, but Moscow is so beautiful ‚Äì it only becomes better.
You have just turned your attention to Syria.
Were there terrorists there, though?
Or is it ISIL? Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticised it then in an interview because, he said, I didn't really understand what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I've been there and seen the state snipers shooting my children's friends on the streets of Homs.
Among all the Russian citizens there, only your soldiers have visited, who began bombing thousands of peaceful civilians in 2015, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Indeed, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller:
They came for the socialists first, but I remained silent - because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for the union members, but I kept my mouth shut - because I'm not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defence."
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did this.
But most remained silent.
Some are actually saying it now ‚Äì for example, Dmytro Hlushchynsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most people allow themselves to talk to the diaspora, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking to end up in a new gulag or in the company of Navalny.
As for the others, you know best where you live.
So I'm sure you understand: when Putin is done with the Ukrainians - or, as seems very likely, if that doesn't work out, when he's done with himself - he'll come after you.
Dear friends, for all of you: for those who came out to the protests bravely, but mostly alone, and for those who will do so in the near future, albeit briefly, but soon will receive a more serious term.
For every thousand of you who signed the petition, who expressed discontent in social networks (even if only by a black square in Instagram), or who expressed themselves privately to colleagues at work.
Times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given for just an anecdote are long gone - and now they are likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak up for you? Who will remain?
The example of the Ukrainians - even more than in 2014 - scares the Putin regime: they prove that it is possible to fight it.
And that reason, motivation and courage can stop it, no matter how daunting the odds.
Considering all of it, few in Russia are aware of just how long a war is going on.
But you, my friends, well know what is happening now.
You read foreign news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine, you maintain contact with them.
And Putin knows that you know.
So be prepared.
You understand what is going on.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are a joke, your laws, if not subject to repressive practices, are worth no more than the paper they are written on, your last independent media outlets have been silenced, your economy is being destroyed faster than I can write this, you have no credit cards to buy tickets to fly out of the country, even on remaining flights there are no tickets to be had.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your agreement, your obedience.
And, if you don't give him that, he may try to run away, or he may be killed.
I doubt you'll see another version.
And there's still one more.
Which will eventually topple this regime.
And perhaps, in the circumstances, you will need less than you think.
Consider it.
The spark will not come from you: through economic collapse, which is engulfing Russia, it is likely to flare up in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices rise and wages aren't paid, it's the people who voted for Putin all these years, for bread and peace, who will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city comes out with its own rally, as they have done periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them one by one.
There needs to be organization and coordination. The crowd needs to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical instrument - the internet, which the regime can cut off, but which still works and which can be hooked up almost in any circumstances.
The organization of Navalny was smashed, but you can create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.
You are many, you are millions.
Moscow police may be able to cope with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly thousands.
If it's over 300,000 it will be staggering.
The army will have to be used, but will it fight for Putin when the time comes?
After everything he put them through in Ukraine, after everything he made them do?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel an understandable fear; those with children will fear for them.
And this is natural, this is normal.
I too would have been afraid there.
In the case of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to disregard their master, those who not only demand freedom, but actually seek to win it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be needlessly lost.
Your son cracks a joke on a computer game chat - and is arrested; your daughter posts her outrage on the internet - and is arrested; your close friend makes a mistake - and is killed in a Syrian cell by police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years - and it will only intensify further, on an ever greater scale.
So the choice is yours. If you do nothing, you know what will happen.
Be cool-headed, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were at the lesson on Friday, and they told us we could come on Monday
We will be home in the evening.
What do you think of me as press secretary?
How often do you eat dinner in a fancy restaurant?
Once in a while I go to a fancy restaurant for dinner
I'll try to explain it to her)
We liked it very much and we wanted to do something better.
There were a lot of people in the room. She was exhausted energetically.
I feel bad, cough, fever, my voice disappeared, weakness and my head spins.
I must go to that government of work
We did this, but said that those who registered in April will receive money only at the end of the month
On Thursday, a pass is needed, and we are going to the doctor with the children.
But at night I got a letter from a lady who liked my work and wanted to have something from me in her house.
I am waiting for new news from her and will definitely inform you.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, intellectual work, in which I was completely disappointed.
It's very bad to lose time, but it's life experience.
In my personal life I am communicative, but I am monogamous and serious about issues of marriage.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died of a heart problem.
I think that for creating a family people should love, respect and trust each other.
I haven't seen that.
Good day. Can you buy forms for baking paska (paper or silicone)?
Great, thank you for the advice, I will put it in the application right now.
She has a broken leg in a lying position, a broken wrist in plaster in a lying position, and a pram lying down
Mr Reihard, I apologize for disturbing you out of working hours.
But I have an important question for you.
I came to the game room to Natasha today to greet her.
She was in an unpleasant situation.
But when the children went home, one mother refused to take her child, saying that she had come to look at the things and put them away in that room with the clothing, and pan Valeyry yesterday opened our children's room until 7pm.
Is this really true?
The working hours of the room are until 4 p.m.
And ultimately it is our responsibility.
But my internet is very slow and doesn't open the page
Good day, we are all right) Kolya is working, the invitations were filled yesterday, and I was studying with the seniors before the exam in the gymnasium.
It is the hardest to untangle thanks to geometry.
On Saturday, Vladimir helped us.
Vika is studying universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We are very grateful for the accommodation
I thought you didn't fill it out.
We will try to collect the maximum amount by the end of the week in order to calculate
The situation with the Russian invasion - briefing by the adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Alexei Arestovich (10.04.2022).
The adviser to the head of the presidential administration told about the heroic act of the senior officer of the coastal troops in Mariupol - he was surrounded and injured, so he blew himself up with the radio station so it would not be handed over to the enemy.
I have a very important question, will my daughter's 5 years (bronchial asthma) help me put her on the list now she has a cough and a cold ...
We need a family doctor for her who will understand a little Ukrainian or Russian.
We urgently need a consultation with a doctor and are very worried about her condition.
We live in the Czech Republic, Doln√≠ Chabry. We need a doctor who is either here in Doln√≠ Chabry or somewhere nearby, possibly Brno, but not far from the metro, so we can get there.
The butterfly exhibition was very popular.
Butterflies landed on the children's hands and feet.
How is your day?
Lord, what an amazing vagina! I am so grateful, words can't describe how grateful I am. You did an amazing job ‚ù§Ô∏è
The mother has been standing there since 4 a.m.
Maybe the lady will leave her phone for communication.
For me, so far, the best option is this house in Prague 8.
The director did not say anything to me about the possibility of sponsorship for the children's meals.
He gave me these data for payment.
For part of March and April I have already paid for food.
If you had the possibility to help me pay for May and June?
What do I need to do?
Should I take it up with the headteacher about this?
Is it better to go on Mondays or come on Wednesdays?
All your friends will know that you are talking to me
I don't know what to do, I need a place to live soon
Was it you who ended the relationship or did your partner leave you?
