In the face of the "Omicron tsunami", the UK is relying on the third dose of vaccine
Faced with an "Omicron tide" that is sweeping the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Sunday night that there would be a strong acceleration of the vaccination campaign, with the aim of offering a third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to all adults by the end of December.
No one should doubt: there is a tsunami of Omega coming, and I fear that it is now clear that two doses of vaccine are not enough to guarantee the level of protection we all need, Boris Johnson said in a speech broadcast on television at 20.00 (GMT and local time).
But the good news is that our scientists are convinced that with a third dose - a booster dose - we can all maintain our level of protection.
Relying on this third dose to avoid overwhelming hospitals and paralyzing the economy, Boris Johnson has announced to advance by one month the objective of offering this recall jab to everyone over 18 in England.
They will now be able to benefit from this before Christmas.
Other parts of the UK (Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales) will also speed up their vaccination programmes.
To accompany this fight, vaccination centers will multiply, their hours will be extended, soldiers will be deployed, and thousands of vaccinators will be trained, the conservative leader detailed.
Rapide augmentation -
This solemn announcement, from Downing Street, comes just hours after the raising of the Covid alarm level due to a "rapid increase" in cases of the Omicron variant, which has prompted the government to announce new measures.
The total number of cases of Omicron detected in the UK has reached 3,137, an increase of 65% compared to the total of 1,898 cases recorded on Saturday, but the real number of cases would be much higher.
Detected in the UK only a little over two weeks ago, Omicron is expected to be the dominant variant in a few days, estimates the government
The alert level has been raised from three to four, the second highest level, which indicates that "the transmission is high" and that the pressure on the health services is "high or increasing."
The first elements show that Omicron is spreading much more quickly than Delta and that the vaccine protection against the symptomatic diseases of Omicron is reduced, stressed the public health officials of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in a joint statement.
The seriousness of Omicron "will be clearer in the next weeks," but they note that there have already been hospitalizations due to Omicron and that it is "probable" that their number "will increase rapidly."
The UK is particularly affected by the pandemic with more than 146,000 deaths and some 50,000 new infections recorded every day.
Fronde des conservateurs -
In addition to accelerating the vaccination campaign, screening will be extended.
From Tuesday, totally vaccinated people who have tested positive for Covid-19 will be asked to carry out daily antigenic tests for seven days.
Those who are not vaccinated must stay isolated for ten days.
These announcements come on top of other measures recently announced by Mr Johnson, including returning to remote working and introducing a health passport at some venues like nightclubs.
Subject to approval by MPs on Tuesday, these new measures should be adopted thanks to the support of the opposition Labour party, but Boris Johnson is exposing himself to the distrust of a part of his conservative camp.
Among the rebels, MP Steve Baker judged the additional restrictions to be "disproportionate".
He told Sky News that like him, a score of Tory MPs would vote against the new measures.
In addition to this rebellion in its ranks, Boris Johnson is weakened by a series of scandals linked to alleged parties at Downing Street last winter, when the British were supposed to limit social interactions to avoid the spread of the virus.
The most senior British official, Simon Case, is leading an internal investigation.

Avis et expériences FFS
Hello everyone,
I have booked a date with you for an FFS in January and in the summer of 2022.
The operations are carried out in two stages:
- the bottom of the face (I'm going to get my jaw broken, pull my chin up and break Adam's apple)
- the rest of the face (frontal bump and nose): this second operation will be done at the same time as my vaginoplasty because the surgeons are very good at it.
But here I am, terrified.
The idea of having surgery scares me already.
Then, adding the unknown of the post-operative ward (pain, sensation, look of others, ...), it's panic.
By chance, I wanted to know if any of you had already been there and could share your experiences, feelings and other things with me?
How are the pains, the duration of the post op.
The wait for the verdict, etc.
Thank you in advance for your shares :)
What will happen afterwards?
I receive a new reader and I return the defective one later?
Question around a joint property
Hello everyone,
First of all, thank you to all the contributors to this sub, which is a true goldmine of information and has allowed me to take effective control of my finances about a year ago.
My post is not about personal finances in the strict sense and is concerned with a problem of becoming undivided property.
Thank you in advance for moving or deleting it if it has nothing to do with this part of the forum.
My father-in-law (79) is the owner:
- of his RP;
- on the one hand, a property in joint ownership with his sister, with whom he has had no contact for years and with whom he is irreconcilable.
The property is undivided, uninhabited, probably run-down and subject to disputes over co-ownership.
It is the sister in question who has the keys and who "manages" it (if we can say that).
My father-in-law has hardly any documents in his possession concerning this property.
One part was hypothecated by "social aid" when their father (who died a long time ago) went into a retirement home and the debt was not claimed.
We don't know if the taxes linked to this property are properly paid...
After years of doing the ostrich and completely ignoring the subject, my father-in-law has begun to worry about it and it is causing him concern.
He would like to get rid of this burden and enjoy his old age in peace.
I try to convince him to make an appointment with a lawyer or notary to discuss the situation, but this simple gesture makes him return to his painful family history and his administrative phobia does not help him to take the step.
I don't want to rush it.
He does not expect anything from this joint ownership.
He is prepared to sell his share to his sister but that would involve contacting her, getting her to accept and for someone to handle the paperwork.
It is certain that his sister would refuse any arrangement, even if it were in her favor.
There remains the possibility of a court-ordered division, but he is reluctant and does not see his sister, also elderly, assigned within the framework of a judicial procedure that would take years.
To help him little by little and "clear" until he agrees to consult a professional in law, I solicit your advice on the following points:
1) In case of death of my father-in-law, the situation of the joint ownership of the property being complex, do you know if the whole of his succession would be blocked?
Or can the notary organise the succession of his other assets (i.e. his RP and the few assets he holds) and isolate the case of this asset in common?
2) If the succession is necessarily global, I understand that my wife (only child of my father-in-law) would become the owner of the part of the property in common.
Could the notary, in the course of this succession, require the other co-owner to obtain a kind of inventory of the situation of the property (title deed, list of any current disputes, tax liens, etc.)?
3) We have no contact with the sister in question, no common knowledge, not even her coordinates.
She has neither children nor partner (a priori).
It's a question that may seem strange, but would we be informed by any authority if this sister were to die?
In the absence of contrary provisions in a will, I understand that it would be... my father-in-law who would inherit his share of the property in common, or my wife if he were no longer there.
Ideas on how to manage it best?
Thank you in advance for your comments!

Bikepacking during hunting season
I am going to have a few days off soon and if the weather is nice, I would really like to do a bit of bikepacking (offroad).
As the "great crossings of xxx by bike" are rather difficult (a lot of D+), I have made my own itinerary linking Nevers to Auxerre (130 km) avoiding the roads and with the objective of doing 40 km/day.
It's very little as it's not a marked trail, I'm expecting a lot of surprises (paths that have been washed away, inaccessible or even non-existent).
The only thing that gives me a bit of anxiety is the passages through wooded areas.
Normally it should be the opposite: I love to ride in the woods but as the hunting season is open I have a bit of anxiety.
Above all, I will go through some pretty wild parts, so potentially frequented by hunters.
Do you have an opinion on the matter?
Is it possible?
Is it better to avoid wooded areas?
Is it better to avoid bikepacking altogether during the hunting season?

Mammectomy urgent in Bordeaux
Petite backstory: I've been on Testo for a year now, I've been seeing a psychiatrist for three years and I need a mastectomy.
I went to see a plastic surgeon at the CHU, who was part of the "transgender" programme, and he explained that he was doing good work and was 100% refunded by the health insurance and the mutuals.
Outside, in order to be able to pass under his scalpel, he told me (I think) that it would take two years of follow-up with a psychologist who is part of the "transgender" network.
I have had three years of psychoanalysis, but not with a psychoanalyst from this programme.
In short, the facts are rather unpleasant.
I am really very dysphoric, my chest bothers me mentally, socially and physically to the point where I can't take it anymore.
I have always been suicidal and depressive, but my chest makes me anxious as well.
Finally, it's much more complex than that, but to sum up, it's hell and it's stopping me from living my life.
I had an appointment with Dr Plarier at Charles Perrens this Thursday, an appointment I took 5 months ago!
I call today to make sure everything is okay, and I am told no, that they have tried to contact me to tell me the meeting was postponed.
Except that the secretary recorded a bad number...
In short, the reunion is being pushed even further, I don't yet know how far.
I desperately need this mammectomy.
I have been planning to do this for years.
So I ask you, in the best case, would you have a better way, or better doctors who could help me start the transition to mastectomy quickly?
And in the worst case scenario (but still possible), would you have private surgeons doing good work on Bordeaux?
Thank you very much, it would save my life.
Yes, but when you zoom in it's impossible to fix the page, it's too big or too small and off to the right or left.
I did this operation but I always have a very weak connection.

In two months there is a big chance that I will do a lot of cycling (2 x 8 km/day).
The route is slightly uphill for the outward journey, and slightly downhill (false flat) for the return.
My physique is 1m85 - 120 kg.
I went to Dacthlon this weekend and a bike caught my eye:
ELOPS SPEED 900
My level of knowledge in cycling is very low, so I would appreciate some advice from people with more experience.
If you have any other proposals concerning a bike, I am interested.
I don't understand why I have to download books again that I have read on my Kindle, and when I press on the download button, it indicates pending.
Pyrénées-Orientales: Trainee winegrowers in agroecology seek Catalan patrons
The Apprentis d'Auteuil and the Pays de la vallée de l'Agly foundation have just launched a "100% on-site" viticultural worker training programme in agro-ecology (organic, biodynamic).
Objective: to allow young people registered with Pôle emploi to enter the jobs market, while providing vineyard owners involved in the scheme with workers with skills tailored to their needs.
Testimonies.
The motivation is there.
For a week, Argan, 26, has been making the trip between Perpignan and Céret by bus every morning.
Then he cycled up the winding forest track that leads to winemaker Michaël Georget's property.
Arrived in the department less than a year ago, the agricultural worker from the north is one of the twelve young people currently taking part in the Skola viti programme, which focuses on agro-ecology and is offered by the Apprentis d'Auteuil foundation, in partnership with the association of the Pays de la vallée de l'Agly.
I wanted to do something other than vegetable growing and get trained in agroecology, says Argan.
Working outside, in nature, brings me a certain well-being, a strength.
With this training, I hope to acquire enough knowledge to launch my own domain in the long term.
Since I moved in with Michael, I am at the height of happiness.
I can ask him billions of questions!
It must be said that Argan fell well.
Car Michaël Georget, whose domain (Le Temps retrouvé) is shared between the Vallespir and the Albères, is inexhaustible on agro-ecology.
And for good reason: since 2006, he has practiced exclusively biodynamic culture.
This formation, it's a super project, enthuses Michaël.
We need help!
The Skola métiers de la vigne training programme, which started on 2 November and will continue until next October, was born out of a simple observation.
In our department, which has the highest unemployment rate in metropolitan France, on the one hand you have young people with no training or work, and on the other you have winemakers who are looking for staff, but cannot find any, explains Myriam Levalois-Bazer, the project charge de mission for the Pays de la vallée de l'Agly.
In addition, as part of this training, it is the winemakers themselves who choose the modules of teaching, so that the young acquire the skills appropriate to their needs.
80% insertion in the Médoc
Open to 18-30 year olds registered with Pôle emploi, the course is now fully booked for its first edition in Catalonia.
After a phase of pre-qualification, during which the young people are trained in the first gestures and turn from domain to domain, they will switch on 20 December to professional ten-month contracts.
And in early October 2022, they will get their qualification certificate as viticultural workers in agro-ecology. "We are still looking for winemakers for the professionalisation contracts," says Laszlo Sas, employment/training adviser at the Apprentis d'Auteuil.
For the time being, we only have nine.
We are missing three of them.
Warning to amateurs.
In the Médoc, where the Apprentis d'Auteuil Skola project is on its third sale, the foundation reports an insertion rate of 80%.

Tips for cooling off in Lyon
Hello the Lyonnais!
With a friend, we would like to spend a quiet afternoon in Lyon (or the surrounding area), in a green space, preferably without being glued to other people.
The idea is to be able to stretch out, chatter and smoke, to be in a little bubble but not locked in an apartment once.
We have a car but if we can avoid driving in the centre that would be great, it's easy to get carried away.
When I talk about this, I thought of golden head but I doubt that we can be calm and fufu?
Do you have to wear a mask?
My research also led me to parks in Gerland or La Guillotière, but it's the same, it's not the best areas to drop in.
Do you have any ideas?
Take care of yourself, bye 😊

A real question of pedal (flat, semi or automatic)
I managed to burst one of my flat pedals (the ones that come as standard, with the cleats) on my Triban RC520 Gravel.
I suppose I do have a heavy foot, or she had suffered some earlier shock.
I did about 1,500 km in 15 months with this bike, mainly using velotour (I put the mudguards on and carried a bag).
I have always known flat pedals, sometimes with platforms, but in fact I realise that it's annoying to have to "search" for the platform after you've put your foot down (which happens a lot in our charming suburbs around Argenteuil and Saint-Denis during rush hour).
I was starting to look at semi-automatic pedals, for the numerous leisure outings during the weekend, but I actually started to doubt: if the cleats are already driving me mad half the time, it's not going to be any better with semi-automatics, always having to look for the "good" side with your foot?
As for the cycling, I'm not going to put my feet on the pedals, I'm less than 15 years old, it's traffic that limits me on three quarters of the journey, not the shape of my kneecaps.
In short, as usual, I think too much and I am more likely to hesitate.
That is why I turn to you: when do you think?
Okay, thanks, I will try
I've tried but it still doesn't work
Yes, I did it and all the covers appear
By e-reader, you mean a reader?
Portulaca oleracea, the pot marigold, is an annual plant belonging to the family of Portulacaceae.
It has been cultivated for centuries, and it is difficult to locate its geographical origin, because this small prolific plant is currently present throughout the world, wherever there is a temperate climate.
The Egyptians consumed it 2000 years ago.
Portulaca oleracea is a low-growing, branched and prostrate plant.
From its short main stem, it develops several stems applied to the ground: its height never exceeds 30 cm and it spreads out in a rounded patch of 30 cm or so.
The stems are slightly succulent and reddish.
Its leaves are opposite, then sometimes alternate at the ends of branches.
They are in the shape of a spoon, sessile, dark green or yellow green, thick (succulence), long at 15 mm.
The flowers, about 6 mm in size, grow from the axil of the leaves, solitary or in groups.
They are characterized by their 2 irregular sepals that surround a corolla of 4 to 6 yellow petals that hold little in the flower.
Self-pollinating, these flowers are visited and pollinated by insects.
They transform into a small capsule in the shape of a top that opens at maturity to release a large number of fine seeds.
There is a form of pot marigold with golden or 'blonde' leaves which is sweeter to the taste, and the leaves are a little wider.
In terms of health, the garden blackberry is an excellent source of vitamins A and C as well as omega-3 acids.
Consommé in large quantities is a laxative.
His taste is sharp-sweet, acidic, with a citrus note for some.
The young leaves are eaten raw to enhance the flavour of a salad, or mixed in to give character and creaminess to a green salsa.
In a vegetable, the purple sprouting broccoli is cooked in boiling water, steam, ragout or added to soups.
His mucilage makes it thicker.
Portulaca oleracea requires a sunny and warm exposure.
The vegetable marrow likes to grow on a bare and worked soil.
This plant needs a well-drained soil and is particularly suited to sandy soils.
On the other hand, to obtain beautiful crispy leaves that are not too bitter, it is necessary to water the potato leaf regularly.
That is why a wild plant can seem too strong, but a cultivated periwinkle can become excellent.
It is sown in the kitchen garden from May, then every three weeks until July.
The branches are pinched, allowing the young leaves to be harvested while forcing it to branch out.
The vegetable stems can be harvested after 8 to 10 weeks.
If they are not harvested too long, the porphyry repels like a salad to be cut.
I just installed it a few hours ago.
How do you update it?
I managed to open one of the books, but I can't get back to the homepage to check the others

I have the impression that my country is dying, and I don't want that
I saw Villepinte's speech, I was fooled.
I saw Eric on France 2, I was shocked.
On a trip alongside Eric Zemmour in Armenia, Philippe de Villiers spoke to Le Figaro on Sunday 12 December about his rallying to the former polemicist.
I am a happy man, I have a peaceful retirement surrounded by laurels for the things I did in my life. I could be content with that but there is something that is an intimate suffering: I have the impression that my country is dying and I don't want that, he explains to our journalist Charles Sapin.
Here there is something stronger than all the laurels, there is the crown of thorns.
Considering that "French and European civilisations" are "in danger", Philippe de Villiers considers that Eric Zemmour is the only candidate who is "at the right height": "He is the only one who has discernment and courage, who talks about civilisation."
Yesterday, Philippe de Villiers officially expressed his support for Eric Zemmour by being part of the delegation accompanying the candidate in Armenia.
What he defends is why I live.
That is why I suffer: "The defense of civilization," he had declared.
And Eric Zemmour added: "We have known each other all our lives, the candidate for the Élysée had recalled. We have 30 years of common struggles behind us."
According to Philippe de Villiers, Eric Zemmour invited him to accompany him to Armenia "on Friday morning, at the last moment".
The former polemicist must return to France on Tuesday 14 December.
I recognised all the boat images, but that's as far as it goes.

Hello everyone, I am in deep shit.
Really.
I am currently on holiday with my parents.
They are super nice but...
They are deeply transphobic.
I got out of there a little over a year ago (December 2019) and it was catastrophic.
Immediately after I had decided to abandon the idea of transitioning, I went back into my shell and didn't move again until the start of the year.
Only there, when my father was talking to me, on my phone open on my desk, on a site talking about transgenders.
Seriously, the discussion I had with them made me flip!
I think I've managed to convince them that I'm cis and that it's nothing to do with trans people, but I'm not sure that's going to last long.
I had to go home next week to cut ties with them and begin my transition MtF but I don't know at all if I won't be discovered by my parents before that!
I am very seriously afraid for my life.
I don't know what they would do if they found out I was transitioning without their consent, and quite frankly I don't want to know!
I don't know what to do anymore, help me!
Sorry, tonight I'm stopping and disconnecting my account and turning off the e-reader. I think it's time to sleep. We'll see tomorrow.
You have really helped me, I won't keep you long, but I thought it was possible to add e-books to the e-reader #PRS_ORG whatever their origin.
I will be very disappointed if that is not the case.
I'm going to lie on the floor and read the technical specifications, and then I'm going to #PRS_ORG to get some clarification.
Thank you and have a nice evening.
Hello, I just created an account with #PRS_ORG# and bought two books.
However, it is impossible for me to open them even after synchronization
I try to close it and it won't.
I can't do anything about it.

Kann jemand helfen, meinen Brief für eine Aufgabe zu korrigieren?
About "Au revoir les enfants" Louis Malle
Ich schreibe einen Aufsatz über "Au revoir les enfants" von Louis Malle und muss einen Brief von Julien, dem Hauptcharakter, an seine Mutter schreiben.
Kann jeder einen Blick auf Grammatikfehler und so weiter werfen?
Dear mother
It's good to hear from you.
A lot has happened since I left.
I found a new friend.
His name is Jean Bonnet.
At first, I didn't like it.
I was very jealous because he plays the piano much better than me and he is also very intelligent.
But it seemed a little bizarre.
I didn't realize he was Jewish.
Bonnet and other students are hidden in the college because they are persecuted by the Germans.
I decided not to say it.
I don't understand why people have something against Jews.
Bonnet and I have a lot in common.
We all love literature, we practice the piano together and we do our homework together too.
He is a good friend.
But I am well and out of danger.
I promise to avoid trouble and do as Father Jean says.
Kisses Julien
I would like to have my own library, my wife and I having different literary tastes
I don't see reinitialising factory settings, but reinitialising your reader.
Is that the same thing?
I borrowed two books from the municipal library, as I do regularly.
When I try to read on my Kindle, a message appears telling me "Your Kindle is not authorised to open this book."
This book is protected by #PRS_ORG#.
Having previously disallowed your e-reader, you must re-import it using #PRS_ORG#."
I can see and open the book on my computer via the reader's peripheral, but I cannot read it on the device.
What to do?
My associate account is #NAME#
Isn't that what I just did?
You can't send me a cable, can you?

The series of the week: "Schitt's Creek", millionaires among the "rednecks"
I've been ruined.
John, you're taking every little pleasure I've earned, Moira screams as the state takes it all.
The matriarch of the very wealthy Rose family has been able to treat herself to many little pleasures during her lifetime, until the family's wealth manager decided to go to the Cayman Islands and leave the family penniless.
Goodbye the palace and its marble staircase, the jewellery, the Florentine eggs and the designer bags.
Miracle: they still have a city bought in 1991 by the father for his son's birthday.
Problem: it was a joke.
Schitt's Creek is a ramshackle town way out in the sticks in America and the Rose family arrive at a run-down motel.
The plumbing is leaky, the rooms smell "like a gym bag" and the mattresses are infested with bedbugs.
A nightmare and a delay, of which one can only delight.
A fine writing
On the other hand, there are the four members of the Rose clan.
The parents (Moira and Johnny) and the children (David and Alexis) are venal, hypocritical, selfish, snobbish, insolent, superficial, and, not surprisingly, extremely lonely.
On the other hand, the inhabitants of Schitt's Creek are archetypes of deep America.
There are "rednecks" (fortunately not all of them) who wear lumberjack shirts, roll in pick-ups, hunt on Sunday, eat "ribs", "cheese balls" and drink litres of beer.
Eugene Levy (father of Jim in the American Pie films) and his son Dan deliberately pushed the buttons (rich/poor, urban/rural) to offer this excellent Canadian series, which is blocked, crude but not vulgar, thanks to a fine writing that is crammed with references.
The son's repartee and his mimics always hit the mark.
Casting five stars
The four main actors are excellent.
Beginning with Catherine O'Hara, impeccable in the role of Moira, an actress in decline, ex-star of a bad soap.
Among the "natives," Chris Elliott, the "weird" mayor of Schitt's Creek, excels in a role as psychopath, as he already did in the film Mary at all costs.
So we can only advise you to watch this fiction to brighten up a gloomy start to winter.
The jurors of the Emmy Awards and the Golden Globes did not make a mistake when awarding the title of best comedy series in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
The first three seasons are available, the last three will follow.
Or update the banking information again?
It's good, I just caught it again
It's the same, there's still no icon When I look at the settings, there are only those for reading
I had several times "oops, an error has occurred"
I "fixed" it and nothing happened
It's good, I have the book.
Thank you very much for your help.
I wish you a happy new year #NUMBER#
I don't receive anything because I can't finalise
You seem to be encountering a problem. If that's the case, tell me and I'll drop it (and I regret it).
How is it possible that for the first book it went well and after impossible?
I have just updated the information indicated.
For the time being, that has not changed.
The reader always displays titles in English and even in Chinese.
Your cleaning / maintenance products, advice.
Hello everyone.
I'm doing 400km in 15 outings, I don't know exactly when to do the chain and gearbox maintenance, but it's time to get serious and start looking at it before I drag it on for too long. The bike has not been on the ground, mud or sand, but I think it's not like when it comes out of the factory.
I am going to invest in the long term with durable tools/products, if possible ecological and biodegradable, I recover dirty water, and I think we should involve the children (on some things), if there is also an alternative 'family/friend' 1L-5L or other economical.
I would go to Leroy Merlin, Mr Bricolage etc but before making a fool of myself...
Could you recommend some cleaning / maintenance products?

Hello, I am unable to create a personal #PRS_ORG# account to manage the e-reader you have just given me.
As my wife's account is linked to my #PRS_ORG account, you have automatically attributed all her library books to me.
How to separate the two?

• The gender associations you choose may be accompanied by legal aid.
I found 'Infos Escroqueries' on a government website.
I'll look into it.
• If you dispute the transfer, banks must prove that the transfer was requested by your mother.
And contrary to what is usually said, your mother is not to blame.
If it goes your way, it's the bank that has to refund you.
How do you establish that it was her who made the transfer or not?
Can we ask to check the IP address used for the transaction + the User Agent of the browser?
Because I am certain that with these elements one could prove that it was not her who made the transfer.
• The delay in blocking the account was normal, but the bank should have monitored suspicious transactions and did not do so.
They sent him away because they said "she had not scheduled a meeting with her adviser"
As for the monitoring of suspicious transactions, they told her that she had not subscribed to the security options... (I find that deplorable on the part of the bank).
• You are well advised to take matters into your own hands, but do not dawdle in contacting a legal/consumer aid, since there is a legal time limit for reacting (one month or two).
Do you have specific associations / legal aid in mind?
Thank you for your help
That's what I did, but it was not accepted.
I try again
It worked, what should I do now so that the eBooks in my #PRS_ORG# app appear in my eReader (#PRS_ORG#)?

I can't close my e-reader
See the photo
I said to #NAME# that I got the e-reader for Christmas and it won't stay closed and I have to keep my finger on the button for ages and I have to do it several times before it closes
Moreover, it freezes and one arrives at nothing, not even to close it.
Tiv skull in bronze from Nigeria.
More than 50 years old.
The Tiv, Jukun, Chamba and Mumuye are ethnic groups that are geographically close to each other.
These ethnic groups, known and recognised, are also surrounded by small ethnic groups that are geographically located in the state of Taraba, the capital Jalingo.
Before the arrival of European colonists, the Tiv were renowned for their love of working the land, with a tendency to extend their cultivated territories right up to the limits imposed on them.
They ended up encroaching on the lands of their neighbors, the Jukun, creating tensions.
At first, a happy conciliation was found: in exchange for a part of their harvest, the Jukun accepted the inconvenience caused.
But as the years went by, the new generations of Tiv decided "to forget" this arrangement.
Their numerical superiority allowed them to generalize the looting of the Jukun without further compensation.
Clashes occurred...
Another source claims that in fact, the blame lies with the Jukun who one day refused to take their share of the cereals, demanding the return of the lands before the next season of abundant harvests.
This was the start of a tribal war.
Finally, the Jukun drove the Tiv off their land.
But the Tiv who had buried their family on Jukun land could no longer repatriate the remains.
They tried to negotiate for the right to bury their dead on Jukun land, but the Jukun would not allow Tiv on their land, even to hold commemorative funeral ceremonies.
Rumors suggested that the Jukun desecrated the graves of their parents.
Desperate, the Tiv consulted the sages and the diviners.
They all met in a dream and had the revelation and solution.
The spirits told them that their parents, buried there, complained of being abandoned among their enemies, and that under their tomb, they were angry with their descendants.
Coincidentally, the harvest that year was very bad because of a dry start, which was very unusual.
So they took the signs seriously, expecting the worst.
The Tiv people again consulted the elders and diviners for advice on what to do to appease their parents' anger.
After another dream, the diviners ordered the entire Tiv people to make a coffin and a miniature skeleton for each of them.
He would be buried at home after the rites that were performed for the dead, and a great funeral service would be held in the market square at the time.
Here's how the idea of the skeleton statues was born among the Tiv.
And as time passed, they began to carve larger and larger skeletons.
Each era had about the same size.
Today the size has a meaning and means that the man was born (small skeleton), the man grew up (average size) and the man lived (big size).
The coffins decompose, but the statues end up being sold.
Other objects serve as supports, such as the Caryatid seat, with its ancestors' skulls.
It is possible that this cult overflowed onto the Ibo who also have artefacts of a similar style.

Hello, I finally managed to download my books bought at the #PRS_ORG# to my e-reader, but it can't open the documents.
Here, I ordered two books and I have the receipt.
One of the two books does not download, or has a problem, after several synchronizations.
A short text on Sherlock Holmes.
Help me to correct it.
Since I was a little girl, I have always been interested in stories of intrigue and crime.
For example, when I was a student at primary school, I watched every day on TV the adventures of Inspector Gadget.
Over time, I have met a lot of characters like this thanks to my passion for reading and cinema.
Without a doubt, my favorite is Sherlock Holmes, written by the English author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
He is the protagonist of several novels and stories.
Physically, he is described as a tall and slender man.
But what defines him most is his singular personality: he is really intelligent and inventive, as well as cold and ironical.
His method for solving mysteries consists of talking to witnesses and investigating the circumstances of each case.
Plus, he has the help of a partner, Dr. Watson.
I think this character is the most famous fictional detective in the world.
I'm glad it can be found in all media because I love his analyses and interactions with the rest of the characters.

The announcement concerns only the length, section and colour of the cable of the announcement.
Before any order, see the explanation on the photo between a section in mm² and a diameter in mm, because a coupler gives dimensions in mm and not in mm², so to calculate the section of a cable, use the formula: the diameter of the copper with a coupler in mm Xpar 3.14 = the section in mm².
-The cable sections available are 6mm2, 10mm2, 16mm2, 25mm2, 35mm2 or 50mm2, 70mm2 Standard announcements are made for the following lengths: 1.2.3.4.5. 6.7.8.9.10 metres, 12 metres, 15 metres, 20 metres, in black, in red, in double black and red and 6 and 16mm2 in green.
We adapt to all requests as follows:
Possibility to mix sections, lengths and colours
- Possibility of having cables made to measure (a rule of three applies to the price)
-We don't charge for labour for bespoke lengths
- The possibility of having cables equipped with covers sewn with 6 or 8 or 10 or 12 mm holes from one manufacturer to another the outer diameter of the cable can vary, but the section of copper will never vary Don't hesitate to contact us for a quote for made-to-measure, if you are happy with the quote we will create a special advert for you.
For those who have doubts about the section of the cable for a 12 or 24-volt device, possibility to send you an Excel file by e-mail for the calculation of the section of the cable according to the length of the cables and the power in watts of the winch or the hoist (we will send you the file for this purpose to your e-mail address), or otherwise to communicate the power of your appliance or its amperage in running order, the voltage of 12 or 24 volts, and the length of the cable including the outward and return journey, and we will calculate the section of the cables.

Weather forecast
I recently started to move around by bike for almost all of my weekly journeys (vélotaff, going into town, sport, etc...) and I first of all wanted to say that this subscription has really helped me in choosing my equipment and adopting good practices, so thank you very much!
To put the context of my future question: I live in the suburbs of the Rennes agglomeration (which is important) and I do about a hundred kilometres a week for all my trips.
If I have succeeded in equipping myself to brave the vagaries of the Breton weather, I have not managed to find a weather app that is relatively reliable for my location.
Indeed, I am a keen user of Windguru (which is very effective) but I cannot specify my exact location as this requires the pro version (around €20 a year).
Being relatively well equipped, it's not more of a nuisance than that, but I'm quite fussy and I like to know in advance how to plan my day.
My question is this: Have you got any apps or websites of this type that are free and reliable?
I will try to avoid spending this amount annually.
Thank you for your answers!
Relocation to Lyon?
I come to see you because I am thinking of moving to Lyon.
Here's my situation: young graduate, unattached, working as an IT engineer, I take home around €1,900 a month after tax and other deductions.
Currently, I live in Saint Étienne (yes, go check it out, and throw some rocks) and therefore I pay a ridiculously low rent (around 400 euros for a 60m2), the thing is that my company has moved from Perrache to Saint Priest... So the travel time is considerably longer...
So I told myself it was an opportunity to "re-evaluate" my choices.
And one of the options is to move to Lyon (the other is to take the car and make a 50-minute to 1-hour journey each way, after which I have 50% remote work... )
So I wanted to know the state of the property market and whether my situation will allow me to live comfortably?
In a not-too-small apartment (I'd like 35-40m2).
What do you think of my situation? Are there any areas to avoid?
Any advice to give me?
It is readable on my smartphone, I see the cover on my e-reader but it doesn't open.

The general brawl between the players of Standard and Antwerp
Tension is mounting at the Bosuil.
While the referee blew the half-time whistle, Abdoulaye Seck literally threw himself on Selim Amallah.
In the images, one can see the Moroccan discussing with Bjorn Engels.
Then the Senegalese got angry and started a general brawl.
This resulted in a red card for the Antwerp player and a yellow card for the Standard winger.
At half-time, Vincenzo Ciuro, present on the Eleven Sports set, had a few answers.
According to the match delegate, racist insults would have caused the altercation.
Information to be taken on a conditional basis until the arbitrator has expressed himself on the matter.
Transgender binary.
A passing phase?
One of the most common things among trans people is the transition.
But the transition, generally, has an end.
Taking up the concept of liminality (the phase between the loss of an old status and the acquisition of a new status), the transition can be considered liminal.
When you're interested in certain trans identifications, terms like women/men or women/men trans appear.
At this level of identification, it appears that some people no longer consider themselves trans.
Which raises the question.
If transition can be envisaged as a preliminary phase, transidentity can also be envisaged as preliminary.
If the passing is good, and the trans identity is not perceived, then we will be read as cisgender.
We are thus acquiring our new status.
So, I asked myself.
Do you think being trans is a phase, or do you think we stay trans even after our transition?
I disconnected my phone and tablet, waited 3 minutes and reconnected just the app for now
I use the app to recover my books on the e-reader because I have problems connecting to Wi-Fi with it.

Hello everyone, we are now in the Stockholm archipelago - perhaps our best natural wonder.
Just like Alva showed, there are several boats in the city center that could take you here.
Obviously, as you can see, this place is beautiful.
There are a lot of islands and in the winter when it snows, it's really a magical winter wonderland.
However, the aesthetic is not the only thing the archipelago has to offer.
It also offers the possibility to do a lot of activities.
For example, when there is wind, you can do some sailing.
And a day without wind?
No problem.
One can rather tan on a beach.
I mean that the archipelago of Stockholm is a place where the word boring doesn't exist.
And the Swedes agree.
Or I think so because the archipelago of Stockholm has quickly become our most popular destination.
I am almost certain that you, just like the Swedes, would be happy to visit this place.
The archipelago really has a rich history.
For example, it was painted by Olaus Magnusson in 1555.
That one of the greatest Swedish artists has painted this place is a symbol for the great cultural and historical importance of the Stockholm archipelago.
In 1813, a military base was built in the archipelago.
This building was the beginning of the military era of our archipelago - an era that continues to this day.
In conclusion, this place has great cultural and military significance in the history of our capital.
The future of the archipelago, just like its history, is very interesting.
To begin with, many scientists think that global warming and overfishing will destroy ecosystems and make the archipelago less beautiful.
It is really possible, so I hope you, and your compatriots, will appreciate this natural wonder while it lasts.
Thank you very much for your attention.
See you soon in Stockholm!
I updated my credit card.
I have tried to buy a book and always the same problem.
My apologies for the capital letters.
My mistake.

The manipulation of history, a danger for peace
Five years after two resolutions voted by Unesco (15 April and 18 October 2016) concealing the historical and religious link between the Jewish people and the Temple Mount in Jerusalem with its Western Wall, it is the UN this time that is taking up this form of negationism.
On 1 December 2021, the United Nations General Assembly voted in favour of a resolution titled "Jerusalem resolution" initiated by the Palestinian Authority and various Arab states.
This text is an attack on Israel's policy based on a rewrite of religious history.
What is particularly shocking is the will to make this place, as in 2016, a purely Islamic site.
The Mount of the Temple is also the most sacred place in Judaism, where the Temple built by Herod and destroyed in 70 was located.
The UN text indeed calls for "maintaining the historical status quo of the esplanade of the mosques, verbally and in practice"; the English text is even more explicit, since it uses the Arabic name Haram Al-Charif, "the Noble Sanctuary", which gives a clear religious connotation, only retaining the Muslim name of the place.
In fact, it is the third holy place in Islam after Mecca and Medina.
And we insist, by specifying "in Word", i.e. in the use of the name.
The name given to this place by Jews and Christians, namely Temple Mount, is excluded.
Bizarrely, the French text uses the term "esplanade des mosquées" which is a very common expression in France.
This variation in nomenclature may suggest some hesitancy on the part of the author, but the English version is the most important because it is the most widespread.
It is a negationist reading of history that aims to exclude Judaism - but also Christianity, for this is where Jesus prayed and taught - and reserve it for Islam alone.
We see the instrumentalisation of religion by Arab states hostile to Israel, and the manipulation of history with the aim of erasing from this crucial place the Jewish and Christian memories.
It is a bad omen for peace, just when this holy place, which is sacred to the three monotheistic religions, should be thought of as a place of mutual respect and dialogue.
It is the only place in the world where these religions come together, where Judaism, Christianity and Islam live closest to each other.
But instead of measuring the complexity and the opportunity it could represent to move forward on the path of peace, the UN resolution is pouring oil on the fire, because it is a denial of justice and intelligence.
It is a slap in the face for the Jewish people.
As Richard Prasquier, winner of the AJCF prize in 2015, said, "the disappearance of the Temple Mount as a term is not a harmless linguistic dispute."
It is a manipulation of history, which holds a danger for peace.
This is why the Jewish-Christian friendship of France wants to express its indignation at such a manoeuvre.
This indignation also concerns the behavior of France, which voted for this resolution.
It was acquired with 129 votes in its favor; 11 states voted against, 31 abstained.
France is one of the countries that supported the resolution.
During a visit to Vichy, the President of the Republic, Emmanuel Macron, praised history when it tells the truth, and he condemned any form of manipulation and rewriting according to partisan interests.
Yet France, at the United Nations, not only did not oppose such a move, but it contributed to it by its vote.
It is incomprehensible; it adds to the disarray of French Jews confronted with ever more aggressive anti-Semitism.
Hello,
I bought the eBook Ascendance of a bookworm Part 3, Volume 3.
When I download it on my Kindle (via the #PRS_ORG# app), the book I get is only a preview, not the complete book.
I've tried to delete it and re-download it and I get the same result every time.
How do I download the book correctly?
Note that I do my shopping via the #PRS_ORG
That's him and it was the 4th of January
I want to buy a bike but I don't know what type or what budget to consider
Hello everyone,
I would like to buy a bike for occasional short trips (5-6 km on average) in town (and very rarely in the countryside but 1 or 2 times a year why not).
It's for small trips, like going to the gym, to the shopping centre, etc.
By the way, I'm not looking for an expensive or high-end bike, I'll just use it occasionally.
In the ideal world I would like the bike to be manoeuvrable (it will be stored in the cellar behind my girlfriend's VAE, which she uses every day) so as light as possible.
I don't know which bike to turn to: city bike (but it's rather heavy, no?), road bike/cycling (light but expensive no?), VTT/VTC?
In addition, I don't know to which budget to turn knowing that I am looking for opportunities to lower the price.
Instinctively and without really checking the prices, I would say around 150 euros.
Is it too little?
Thank you in advance,
including books in English.
That's what I have access to French-Canadian books
Digital invoice and restricted internet access
I don't know in which category/flair to place this post, so don't hesitate to suggest me!
Let's assume that Bob is a client of the company S.
It only bills its customers electronically.
The problem: Bob only has sporadic access to the internet and cannot therefore check his bills as he wishes.
Question: Can Bob ask S to send him all his bills by post?
If yes, what should be done if S refuses to send it?
edit: I used the keywords "invoice", "paper" on legifrance, but it does not seem to have found anything about it, the terms I used are probably too specific.
Thank you in advance for your answers!

Djebbari promises new night trains by 2030
The minister of transport wants to equip France with a dozen night trains, including connections to European capitals.
The government intends to launch several additional night trains between 2026 and 2030, with new material that would be leased to specialist companies, and also wants to increase the number of night services between European metropolises, the Minister of State for Transport, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, stated on Sunday 12 December.
I want us to have a dozen national train lines at night in 2030, the minister specified in a message sent to the AFP.
And the links from Paris to Briançon, Nice, Rodez and Albi, Latour-de-Carol, Tarbes, Bayonne and Saint-Sébastien (Spain), as well as from Paris to Perpignan, Cerbère and Barcelona, and from Paris to Toulouse, Montpellier and Marseille.
It has added the transversal links Metz/Genève - Nice/Barcelona/Bordeaux and Bordeaux-Nice.
Some of these lines already exist, such as Paris-Nice, which was relaunched in May - Paris-Tarbes-Lourdes, which was relaunched on Sunday evening - or Paris-Rodez, which would be extended to Albi.
Their exploitation could be rationalised with common vehicle paths on part of the route, or not.
The choices of exploitation remain to be made, they say at the ministry.
The Prime Minister Jean Castex has also recently announced a revival of the night train Paris-Aurillac.
I want there to be more European night trains, said Jean-Baptiste Djebbari.
To create new ones, I am launching a call for interest in early 2022.
My ambition is for night trains to connect Paris with the capital cities of Europe: Madrid, Rome, Copenhagen, perhaps even Stockholm, he specified, recalling that the Paris-Vienna service is due to be restarted on Monday and the Paris-Berlin service at the end of 2023.
We also have a project for a line that would connect Strasbourg and Luxembourg to Barcelona via Metz, Nancy, Montpellier and Perpignan, he added.
Concerning the rolling stock, "passengers want comfortable night trains, and that is normal.
The sleeping cars will therefore be back, in addition to the sleeping cars and seats," he announced.
I will make sure that new rolling stock is developed, which will be "delivered between 2025 and 2030," the minister stressed.
It would include 300 cars, a dozen locomotives and two workshops, a total investment of "at least 800 million euros".
To finance them, the best option is for the State to call on one or several rental companies, which will ensure the order and management of the rolling stock," he estimated.
The procedures could be launched at the beginning of 2022 for new night lines from 2026, explained Jean-Baptiste Djebbari.
I bought a book on my new #PRS_ORG (received confirmation by email) but in the section "my books" it is indicated that I have no books yet.
I updated my page but still nothing.
I tried to buy the book again and it was listed as available, but the book is not available in my region.
I always have nothing
I am not even sure that my book is on my e-reader
I'm not sure I understand your question...
I click on the word and a window appears that sends me to the dictionary I have installed, which does not work
Paris or Geneva
Currently I am 30!
I have 5 years of experience, I am an engineer, I work in a consulting firm but in the end it's an ESN!
The professional frame is bad despite that I am involved internally
- the salary is around 50k
- I have a main residence in the small crown
It will be three years in my cabinet and I feel that, despite my investments in internal training, there is no recognition. I remain a consultant lambda, a number.
So I think it's time to change soon, but I have the impression that it's the same system everywhere in Paris, it's just that the salary increases.
That's where I did my research and read old posts on the subject, but in the process I'd love to have your recommendations for people who have left Paris for Geneva!
Are you happy?
Is there a better quality of life in Switzerland?
Do you feel a difference in mentality compared to Paris?
Are you leaving Geneva to return to Paris?
PS: I am aware that every experience is different
It has been more than a half-hour since my e-reader has been in synchronization mode, and my books have not been downloaded.

In the secure order.
At the last stage, after confirmation of the mode of payment
I'm with the call center of my bank, they are trained to update programs related to #PRS_ORG# D secure, which could be the cause; on the other hand, I just bought a book via my PC, which worked, but indeed via the PC the payment had to be made with my token.
I bought the ebook "Fire Force tome 12".
The reader #PRS_ORG# declares that it is an extract and I cannot continue reading.
I am obliged to close.
The volume of the kepub is consistent near #NUMBER# Mo.
I ask that you provide me with the complete version I purchased.
Ok, thanks for your help!
Hoping it works!
Should I leave the conversation?
Good evening!
I followed all the stages but the new authorisations are giving me the same message and I can't read on my Kindle

Rent or sell?
We built our second house in 2020 and had decided to put our first house, a 2014 house, on the market.
The rent is almost identical to the monthly payments on the mortgage, and after receiving our first council tax bill after the agricultural income, we are asking a lot of questions...
We do not make any profit on the rental (which was to be expected) and the total tax (income + real estate) amounts to €2,100 per year.
We still have 17/18 years of credit to repay...
We live in a tourist area and could probably invest in seasonal rental properties (which would generate more taxes, but with a profit that would certainly allow us to pay them), or simply sell this house and get rid of those 2000€ in taxes...
What do you think?
What would you do?
Sell?
Waiting for the credit to be repaid and finally having a source of income?
Do as many interviews as possible to accumulate interview experience, even if the roles are not that interesting to you, so that you can do your best when a role that interests you comes along.
My first interviews were catastrophic, I asked explicitly at the end for points to improve and there was one that stood out: my presentation.
I was too caught up in the unnecessary details and it was long and boring.
I worked on it to make it clear, concise and with only useful information, at the end I was praised for this exercise.
It allowed me to have confidence in my speech and to focus my energy on other points of the interviews.
Another point: the interviews are exchanges, it's not just the candidate who's for sale, there's also the company across from it!
Reducing the power ratio, and even reversing it during exchanges, helps a lot.
But again, it depends on the market and I am well aware that in many places the candidate has to bend over backwards...
The titles are not in French but the menu of parameters is foreign so I don't understand
Magic electronic eye with double sensitivity equipped with an LCD screen (see photos at the bottom of the text).
With its simple installation, this module can replace any type of circular magic eye, such as the EM34, EM4, 6AF7, etc.
It is powered solely by the tension of the filament (6.3 V alternating current) as a traditional magical eye and does not require a high voltage.
Its input impedance is very high, greater than 50 MOhm, and does not introduce any disturbance to the circuit to which it is connected.
It is also equipped with numerous possibilities and functions such as:
- A high-performance frequency meter with the possibility of programming an offset frequency in + or - of the measured frequency.
This frequency counter, for example, allows you to display the frequency of the stations received by connecting to the local oscillator of the receiver, the frequency offset will then be programmed with the intermediate frequency value.
- A voltmeter 0 to 800 V
This voltmeter, for example, allows you to know the value of the high voltage of the receiver.
- Programming of colours and mode of display
The eye takes on the appearance and colours you want: simple (without digital indications) or display of all or part of the measurement functions with two sizes of characters to choose from.
- The program is kept in memory even after the power supply is cut off.
The base color is a green identical to the green of the cathode ray tube, the brightness is constant, very comfortable and does not change with time.
Connections are made by wires, an octal plug is available on request, and the end of the eye can be inserted into it.
Complete notice on request.

By Colissimo or registered mail: We guarantee the product only on request to the customer with photos and explanations.
The biological fight: What is it?
A natural, effective and respectful approach to the environment.
Fighting targeted pests without chemicals and toxins How?
Using the natural predator of the pest
Against which pests?
The laurel leaf hoppers: the yellow aphid What cultures do they occur in?
Plants with low volume (such as roses, hibiscus) and vegetable plants (eggplant, beans, melon...) and laurel rose
Mode of action: The Coccivac® larvae consume all stages of the pucerons (winged, larvae, adults).
They are very voracious and actively roam the plants in search of their potential prey, then empty them of their content.
They can eat up to 100 slugs a day.
Females can lay up to 20 eggs a day.
Indeed, the pests will be eliminated as time goes by, and several generations of this ladybird may develop as long as the aphids are present.
Usage: The product is to be used upon receipt.
They should not be used preventively as they would not have enough pests to feed on.
They should not be used when there are too many aphids, it would take a large number of ladybirds to get rid of them.
The larvae must be used as soon as the first aphid colony appears.
They are sent to the L1 stage, are almost imperceptible to the naked eye and very fragile
Mode d'emploi: Open the box carefully and deposit the larvae and popcorn containing larvae on the vegetation.
The introduction must be made in areas of aphids, to be renewed if there is appearance of new areas of aphids. The efficacy of the larvae is progressive.
In general, there are 1 to 3 larvae per colony of aphids (around 5 to 20 larvae / m² only on the infested plants).
They should not be placed when there is wind.
Content of the box: - Larvae: 1 to 9 mm long, grey, with the presence of two lateral yellow spots and one dorsal yellow spot visible from stage L3.
50% males / 50% females.
In the boxes, the producer deliberately adds more larvae than planned.
Popcorn: the larvae hide inside the kernels.
You may think there aren't enough worms in the box, but they are probably hidden in the popcorn.
Powder: food for the larvae during transport
Mues : you will be able to see mues, these are the skins of the larvae and not dead larvae.
Conditioning: The Coccilaure®.
They are available in 30, 50 or 250 larvae with food provided for transport.
The producer puts more into the box on purpose because we know that some larvae may not survive.
Hinweis:
- In case of strong infestation, clean the plant from its honeydew with black soap and introduce the ladybirds the day after.
- From the end of June to the end of July, the risk of parasitism by other insects is high: use is recommended from March to mid-June.
- In the absence of aphids: no Coccilaure® installation.
- With the presence of ants: like they feed on the honeydew of aphids, they chase the ladybirds.
Predicting to remove them before releasing the ladybirds.
- To chemical residues: do not let the larvae fall onto plants treated with a chemical insecticide for less than three weeks.
Vos larves garanties vivantes : When you receive your package, if the larvae are not alive, we guarantee a refund of the larvae!
How to obtain the dismissal?
Contact us via the assistance (blue and white "ASSISTANCE") on our website within 48 hours of receiving the larvae in your letterbox.

Transfer of PEA to the dead point
First of all, thank you for this sub that is packed with information when it comes to investments!
I would be interested in your advice on how to unblock the transfer of my PEA: after opening it this summer with LCL without really being informed about the management fees at the competition, I have finally decided to transfer it to Fortuneo at the beginning of September.
On September 30, LCL transferred the part titles of my PEA to Fortuneo.
For species, it gets complicated: the transfer is rejected.
Indeed, Fortuneo explains that LCL made the transfer to the wrong bank account.
I exchanged with my LCL broker at the beginning of October who firstly told me that the transfer was validated on their side, then that the stock exchange would investigate to understand why the transfer was rejected.
In the meantime, Fortuneo sent me the coordinates to which to transfer the species.
I sent the message to my adviser on Monday October 18.
Today, no news and no movement.
In contrast, the transfer commission has indeed been paid.
It has been three weeks since the transfer was rejected, and LCL has not taken any action despite the cause of the rejection being known...
I don't really know what to do to unblock the situation and I would like to know if some of you have had a similar experience and an idea of what would be most effective: to insist with my bank (I have sent 3 requests for information/relaunch since 04 October, the last on 18 October which remains unanswered) or to seize the mediator of the AMF immediately?
Or another option that I hadn't envisaged?
Thank you in advance for your advice!
It took at least 15 minutes to close it

Who will take care of the most fragile at Christmas?
The Ségur allowance (183 euros a month net) was awarded to hospital staff then to Ehpad staff for their exceptional mobilisation during the Covid-19 related health crisis.
But she has left aside the vast majority of the medical and social sector, which has nevertheless played an important role in continuity of service for people who are just as fragile and vulnerable.
With the arrival of the fifth wave, general attention once again focuses on the Covid-19 epidemic and its successive variants.
But, in a deafening silence, another drama is being played out in the social and medical fields.
People engaged in care work notice, like those they accompany, a continuous deterioration of living and working conditions.
With budget cuts, freezes in wages, financial management that is dehumanising, in hospitals as in the medical social sector, the same recipes have been used for years.
The same suffering results in it: loss of sensation, burn-out, absenteeism, musculoskeletal disorders for employees; closure of establishments and services, disorder which can lead up to involuntary maltreatment of people accompanied.
The first Ségur of discord
In the spring of 2020, the spotlight was on the hospital, the Ehpad and their beds full of sick people.
Awakened by the daily concerts of applause from the population, the public power has been obliged to open its eyes.
A few months of "consultation" later, the reward for services rendered is announced: it is the "Ségur bonus".
Who soon became a prize of discord.
It was the entire "care" sector that took the lead.
During the successive lockdowns, all of them, from educators to doctors as well as caretaking agents, took risks and remained at their post, without protection or support, by the children's, handicapped people's and elderly people's sides.
Despite the widening of the Ségur bonus to forgotten caregivers obtained in the Senate as part of the examination of the Social Security financing bill, the commitment of all trades has still not been recognized.
Considered as "carers" to demand a vaccine pass from them, but not for salary recognition.
The Ségur prize for the entire staff
We see it in all the establishments that manage our departments, the bonus of discord has dramatic effects.
Trained professionals resign to join establishments eligible for Ségur funding or convert due to lack of recognition, lack of sense.
There are no more applications for jobs that have become vacant.
The few exceptions remain three days in overstretched services, where there is no time to look after people properly.
The file seems to be transferring well.
I then disconnect the peripheral safely (via the toolbox).
Then, on my profile page, I go to "My books".
I try to open the book but I get the error
Thank you for your help, my books are downloaded on my e-reader.

Joe Biden laments "one of the worst tornadoes in US history"
Published on Saturday 11 December 2021 at 22:48
On Saturday, US President Joe Biden deplored "one of the worst tornadoes in US history" after the devastation caused by a series of tornadoes in five US states.
It's a tragedy," he said, "and we still don't know the full extent of the damage or the number of lives lost," with at least 78 deaths, including more than 70 in the state of Kentucky, already tallied.
Hello, my reader is new but two of the books I've bought are displaying an error message when I try to read them (books: "Working Mum" & "The dream life of the orphan socks").
However, the synchronization was done.

Hidalgo assured that she would participate in the popular primary no matter what
Despite the left-wing candidates' refusal to take part in a primary with her, the Mayor of Paris wants to see her initiative through, and is calling on Yannick Jadot to change his mind.
Anne Hidalgo persists and signs her will to participate in a primary.
The candidate of the Socialist Party in the presidential election assured, on Sunday 12 December on JDD, that she will be, whatever happens, a candidate in the popular primary.
While she initially refused to participate in the process seeking to unite the left around a single candidate in 2022, she then called on her left-wing competitors to face off in a primary.
A proposal declined by Yannick Jadot (EELV),Jean-Luc Mélenchon (LFI) and Fabien Roussel (PC).
If you want to mobilise left-wing voters, you have to respond to what they are saying: "Unite, otherwise we won't make it," she insists, now that the left wants to be in the second round, there needs to be a primary before the first round.
The mayor of Paris appeals to Yannick Jadot, whom she wants to face during the popular primary: "I invite him to continue to reflect on it, all the more so as he himself had declared that he would sign up if the number of participants exceeded 300,000 and if I were in favour of it."
The two conditions are therefore met.
Anne Hidalgo, whose campaign is struggling to find its rhythm, assures that she will be a candidate in this process of designating a left-wing candidate no matter what happens.
I don't care about what will happen to my person, I don't care about who will take over from Jean-Luc Mélenchon within La France Insoumise, I don't care about whether within the Greens it's Yannick Jadot's line or Sandrine Rousseau's that is victorious.
What counts is to be able to defend a social-democratic, republican and ecological project," she says.
At first reluctant to the idea of the popular primary, the Parisian councillor now thinks that the initiative opens up a space for political and media debate. "I needed to explore this in my own political family.
There was a glimmer of hope.
There was also a risk, I took it."
Until mid-December, all citizens over 16 can still register to participate in the choice of a candidate.
In January 2022, a definitive list of the personalities chosen will be presented.
The system provides for a vote by majority judgment between 27 and 30 January 2022.
A method that consists of giving an opinion on all candidates via a scale of mentions (excellent, very good, passable, etc.).
We offered an e-reader #PRS_ORG# for Christmas for my son and unfortunately, despite all our attempts, we can't read the transferred books.
We have given all the authorisations both to the computer and to the tablet, but nothing makes it work!

The Master series of mechanical blocks includes a total of 14 models of blocks.
Their design allows you to build two vehicles with manual, spring or remote control from each set.
These are blocks of construction of traditional vehicles enriched with elements that allow their transformation.
The individual elements are equipped with wheels, tracks, loaders, etc., so that they can form vehicles with different functions.
This way, a purchase brings numerous opportunities for pleasure.
The blocks develop creativity, motor skills and manual dexterity.
The collection consists of six models: motorcycle, car, police motorcycle, blue all-terrain vehicle, yellow all-terrain vehicle and police car.
By buying pairs, a third additional vehicle can be assembled from two sets!
- A six-year-old child who is passionate about vehicles, but who will have fun not only with creative pleasure.
A lot more is going on here: the use of a resilient spring allows not only for the principles of physics to be learned, but also for them to be applied in practice.
The line offers a simple conversion of a vehicle into a completely different model.
For example, the articulated lorry can be transformed into a plane, a timber transporter into a buggy, a bulldozer into a self-propelled gun, and a shovel can also be a robot.
- The design of the toy allows you to build two different machines from each set.
Inside the box, apart from several hundred blocks, there are mechanical gears easy to use and assemble thanks to which the construction of the two models and their transformation into a new toy is simple and pleasant.
The task is facilitated by clear instructions on the image.
Such a pleasure requires great manual skills, even for a six-year-old child.
In this case, in addition to the possibility of transformation, the vehicles have gained power modules, thanks to which the small manufacturer will create its own remote-controlled vehicles.
SUV / roadster and sports cars are available in the series.
The range of the remote control is more than 20 metres, which allows you to manoeuvre them freely while playing.
The blocks of this line are equipped with feeding modules and a remote control, which allows them to be built from telecontrolled vehicles with a range of over 20 metres.
The mechanical gear system puts the model in motion by interacting with numerous parts.
A wrecked military vehicle and a faithful reproduction of a fuel tank are available in the series.
An eight-year-old child will be able to deal with it thanks to pictorial instructions that can be read.
Vehicle with coil spring training by coil spring allows you to learn the principles of physics in high quality materials supports small movements develops manual skills.
Not suitable for children under the age of 3.
Here begins the volcanic Loire
If everyone knows the Loire and its châteaux, few realise that the longest river in France rises in the Massif Central.
The first vineyards are located at an altitude of Saint-Etienne (AOC Côtes du Forez) and Clermont-Ferrand (AOC Côte d'Auvergne) before climbing towards Roanne (AOC Côte Roannaise) and Moulins (AOP Saint-Pourcain), the latter being the largest of the four with 600 hectares of vines.
Often overlooked on wine maps, the region was one of the first producers of wines in France a century ago.
But industrialisation and the development of the railway competed with the transportation of wines by river, and little by little, activity declined; only the most passionate winemakers remained.
The Gamay is the variety that is common to all vineyards, principally the Gamay noir à jus blanc (as in Beaujolais) but also varieties close to it, such as the Gamay Saint-Romain, the Gamay of Bouze or the Gamay d'Auvergne, planted here on soils with a basaltic or granitic dominant.

Yorbe Vertessen helped PSV take the lead in the table
Mounted at the game, Yorbe Vertessen equalized.
The 16th day of the championship in the Netherlands was difficult for the leaders of the table.
If Feyenoord shared in Groningen (1-1) and Ajax was beaten at home by AZ Alkmaar (1-2), PSV Eindhoven still imposed itself 1-2 in Nijmegen after a long pursuit.
Mounted at the game (65th), Yorbe Vertessen equalized (80th, 1-1) and Carlos Vinicius (90th, 1-2) signed the success of PSV.
As a result, it has taken the lead in the table with 37 points, one more than Ajax (2nd) and Feyenoord (3rd).
Nimègue, who opened the score with Magnus Mattsson (8th), is in 11th place (20 points).
In Spain, Betis Seville won their fourth victory in a row against Real Sociedad (4-0).
Alex Moreno (14th, 1-0) opened the score before distributing a decisive pass to Juanmi (57th, 2-0).
Adnan Januzaj's (62nd) rise to the game did not hinder the Verdiblancos: Nabil Fékir worsened the score (66th, 3-0) and Moreno got himself a double.
With this victory, Betis (33 points) takes a four-point lead over Atletico Madrid (4th), which plays the derby against Real, and returns to within a length of the Seville FC (2nd).
Real Sociedad is 5th (29 points).
Hello, I am trying to use my new e-reader #PRS_ORG#.
I am told "Your reader is not authorized to open this book"
I followed this guide: #URL# but I always get the same error message after transferring the book
Just a little more patience...
Shutting down and restarting doesn't work.
I'm looking at your other instructions
I am on the list of options
Is it true that I have to take the first option proposed without going on the list?
I have now deleted the authorisation on both sides
I am going to install version 3.0
I don't find the version 3.0.
It always brings me back to version 4.5
Are you still there?
Hours worked indicator Pôle emploi
I have a simple question but I can't find anything on the internet.
My company dismissed me on 19/07 for incompetence.
So I registered at the employment agency and now I have to update my registration.
I must declare the number of hours worked and the amount of my gross salary.
Knowing that for the period of 01/07 to 19/07 I was on paid leave (12 days).
It also appears on my payslip for a bank holiday (I don't work on a Saturday in July) - I'm not sure what this corresponds to, should I count it as hours worked?
So, in the gross income, I should not indicate my compensation for dismissal, should I?
I simply indicate the final submitted data?
Thank you for your return
I am really happy
Thank you very much for your time and patience

The ice rinks in Toronto are open
The Barbara Ann Scott Skate rink, located in College Park (College and Bay), is open daily from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
In the form of a loop, it reopened in 2019 after major renovations.
This allows skaters to exercise even when it is not very cold, thanks to an artificial cooling system.
The Barbara Ann Scott Ice Trail at College Park.
For students at Ryerson University, the small outdoor rink located in the park of the same name, just beside their faculty, offers a great opportunity to have fun after classes.
Many of the city's parks have their rinks with their hours of operation and times for public skating, skating lessons, hockey and shinny (individual skating with a hockey stick and a puck).
The Withrow Park rink, located south of Danforth Avenue between Logan and Carlaw.
In addition to its two rinks, High Park offers its visitors a natural ice rink on its Grenadier pond.

It is a robust and light Cordura® rip-stop rucksack with an extremely effective IR treatment.
Its FUTURA harness promotes transport and stability thanks to its adjustable features that allow each user to adjust it to their morphology.
It includes the 3-litre Antidote™ reservoir.
This 48-hour exclusive MP-SEC France is the result of close collaboration between Camelbak and the French forces.
It is made from Cordura® Rip stop which weighs the same as Cordura® 500D traditional fabric, but it is 50% more resistant to tearing while also being more resistant to abrasion and tearing.
The color of the bag has been modified by the "Camouflage Green 483" color developed for the American army and which presents numerous advantages.
A more muted (less shiny than OD Green), lighter shade that blends better into a multitude of environments and closer to the green of the French CAM CE.
The infrared treatment is much more effective than on OD Green.
Observed with the FLIR and the JVN, the difference is clearly visible.
The lock and Velcro® are adapted to the colour of the bag and infrared treatment.
The material used is composed of a front layer for coloring and IR treatment, an intermediate layer for structure and a back layer for resistance to tearing.

The robot taxis in Dubai
The driving has been "tranquil" so far, without noteworthy incidents, reports Moustapha, head of security during these trials, organised by Bayanat, a subsidiary of Group 42, specialised in artificial intelligence.
Four driverless vehicles, two electric and two hybrid, have been tested under the name TXAI in the emirate of Abu Dhabi since November.
Customers can reserve a ride using an app and be picked up and dropped off at nine predetermined locations across the artificial island of Yas.
In recent days, most of our customers have ordered taxis in front of shopping centres or hotels, explains Moustapha.
After the first phase of trials, a second will begin in the Emirati capital, with at least ten vehicles, the company said.
Robotaxis have been tested in various countries in recent years.
In late November, a fleet of 67 vehicles was put into service in Beijing, but still with the presence of a security agent in case of emergency.
Passing from level L3 (where a security agent is present) to level L4 (without an agent) would be an important step, estimates Hasan al-Hosani, CEO of Bayanat, which says it is cooperating in this regard with the authorities of Abu Dhabi.
Last month, the United Arab Emirates approved a license to test self-driving cars on public roads, despite the lack of federal legislation on the matter, which is one of the biggest obstacles.
This technology is new and regulations related to safety and other operational aspects are currently being developed, explains Mr Hosani.
The neighbouring emirate of Dubai wants to achieve 25% of driverless transport by 2030 in order to reduce costs, pollution and accidents, authorities hope.
Dubai also plans to launch a small fleet of autonomous taxis by 2023, state media reported, targeting 4,000 vehicles in service by 2030.
This change should affect taxi drivers, most of whom in the UAE are migrant workers from Asia.
I did a disconnection and reconnection and it didn't work.

The casting director Olivier Carbone died
The former French casting director Olivier Carbone died this Friday at the Monaco hospital at the age of 56.
Since 2015, he had retired from the world of cinema and lived in Villefranche-sur-Mer.
In the 2000s and 2010s, he was the casting director of several successful French films, such as La Môme with Marion Cotillard, which was awarded the Oscar for Best Actress for this role.
Or "36 Quai des Orfèvres", with Daniel Auteuil and Gérard Depardieu.
In 2009, he worked with Quentin Tarantino on Inglourious Basterds, recruiting Christopher Waltz.
He also founded the Studio Carbone workshop to train young actors.
In 2020, he triggered a violent controversy by insulting actress Adèle Haenel and humorist Florence Foresti on Facebook after the César ceremony.
But what about the mother account?!

Until Christmas, Antibes launches its light show every evening
Let the show begin!
On Saturday evening, the Place des Martyrs de la Résistance was illuminated before an audience of little and big amazed people.
For 20 minutes, projectors sent Christmas balls, snowflakes and glitter onto the floor and facades of the surrounding buildings, to the rhythm of Christmas carols.
To make the magic last, the illuminated parade "White Christmas" with its elves and fairies paraded through the streets of Old Antibes to reach the Esplanade of the Pré des Pêcheurs and the Christmas Village until January 3.
For those who missed the show, be reassured: the appointment is renewed every 20 minutes every evening between 5.30pm and 7.30pm.

The Pluglia Sonic uses a new ultrasound technology that does not disturb the animals.
The essential oils are conducted through the mesh to the diffusing disc, where they are transformed into a mist composed of tiny dry droplets that will disperse in the air according to the air currents.
This diffusion is done at low temperature and without adding water to benefit from all the benefits of essential oils.
Plugia Sonic works with three diffusion cycles of 4 hours, 8 hours or non-stop so you don't have to worry about it.
The transmitter uses new ultrasonic technology that does not disturb the animals.
The essential oils are conducted through the mesh to the diffusing disc, where they are transformed into a mist composed of tiny dry droplets that will disperse in the air according to the air currents.
This diffusion is done at low temperature and without adding water to benefit from all the benefits of essential oils.
Position: the diffuser functions in full light as in the dark, according to the cycle chosen (4h, 8h or non-stop).
When it's dark the power of the luminescent witness decreases.
Position: when it gets dark, the diffusion stops, the luminescent witness goes out and the chosen diffusion cycle (4h, 8h or non-stop) goes into "pause".
When the light is sufficient, the diffuser automatically resumes operation and continues its cycle.
Characteristics of the Pluglia Sonic wall diffuser
We advise you to clean your diffuser frequently to avoid clogging the distribution system, for this:
Unplug the wall outlet.
Remove the essential oil bottle.
With a cotton bud soaked in cleaning fluid for diffusers of essential oils, gently clean the top and underside of the shiny metal disc (situated at the bottom of the diffusion output), without pressing down too hard, in order to dilute any possible residue of dried oils.
Remove the dropper from the bottle of essential oil diffuser and insert a cotton wick.
Visser pours the bottle into the diffuser.
Rebranch the transmitter and let it operate for about 5 minutes.
As it spreads, the mop of diffusion will be cleaned and the diffuser itself.
The transmitter is now ready to be used again.
The diffusion mats are reusable.
In the case where essential oils have completely dried out inside and this alters their good functioning (even after cleaning the wick and diffuser, as explained above),
It is recommended to soak the bristles in domestic alcohol for more than an hour, stirring them occasionally, then to let them dry before reusing them (the alcohol will dilute the essential oil residue and evaporate as it dries).
In an eco-responsible approach, we have developed a cleaning agent that is recyclable.
After use, you can recover the cleaning liquid mixed with essential oils for reuse in the initial bottle.
Even with essential oils in the cleaning agent, it retains all its effectiveness.
Precautions for using the Pluglia Sonic diffuser
Avoid diffusing essential oils that are "too thick" or "too viscous", as the diffusion would not work and you would risk saturating the diffusion misters.
Do not diffuse synthetic perfumes.
In order to avoid any risk of essential oil escaping, it is imperative to use this diffuser in the vertical position, with the output directed upwards.
Never place anything more than 1 metre above the diffuser.

Brncic after Liège's victory over Patro: "My dream is to be able to play with the same intensity for 70 minutes"
The Liégeois started the match strong but gradually let up.
Without conceding to the Limbourgeois.
Drazen Brnčić and his guys hardly had the right to make a mistake.
After wasting points against Francs Borains and Olympic, the Liégeois had to react in front of the leaders from Limburg in order not to be left behind a little bit more by the leading teams.
And the contract was fulfilled.
Taking their opponents by the throat, D'Ostilio and his friends were able to score via Nathan Rhodes in the 6th minute.
Sang et Marine even went close to 2-0 but the visiting goalkeeper miraculously saved a shot from Mouchamps (11th).
It's our best first period of the season, says the Liège coach with a smile.

Below in grey "Annul the repair" LAST SYNC: 16:01
Is it possible for a person to sue their own mother in order to obtain compensation for disabilities caused by their mother's behavior during their intrauterine life?
Example: a pregnant alcoholic woman whose baby is born with clearly alcohol-related health problems could be sued by her child (now an adult) for compensation?
If you go further, a child born prematurely (prematurely) due to blows to his mother during pregnancy could turn against the person who hit his mother for compensation for the damage suffered?
I am not looking for an answer for myself.
I just want to know how French legislation views intra-uterine life and the (or not) responsibility of the pregnant woman (and her relatives) for the health of her foetus.
It is this conviction in the USA of a 21-year-old woman addicted to metamphetamines that makes me ask this question.
In this case, it was likely Oklahoma itself that seized the opportunity to pin the blame for the miscarriage on this poor woman, arguing that she was guilty of the "murder" of her 17-week-old fetus because she was taking methamphetamines when she went into labor...
It does not seem that a definitive link has been established between her false pregnancy and the drug-taking, and yet this woman will spend four years in prison (after already having spent one awaiting trial).
I know that's not the same thing as the question I'm asking you, and I know that France doesn't have the same legislation.
I just wanted to share with you the source of my questioning.
Thank you in advance.
EDIT: To be even more clear on the reasons for my question, a supplementary thought.
If an adult can sue their mother for "negligence" during their intra-uterine life, does this mean that the law considers a foetus as a "person" towards whom the pregnant woman has obligations?
If yes, doesn't the law give right to the "pro-life" anti-abortion movement?
(It seems to be the case in Oklahoma, since this woman's conviction only holds if the foetus, even if it is dead, is given the status of a person with specific rights, including the right not to be the victim of an involuntary abortion due to, or not, to drug use.)
Otherwise, an adult should not be able to attack their mother for "negligence" because, at the time she was pregnant, she was not a person with specific rights.
I don't know if I am clear.
Network Service Gateway Nokia Alcatel Lucent Nuage Network 7850 NSG-X
Passerelle de services réseau Alcatel lucent Nuage networks 7850 NSG-X Services de réseau 7850 Gateway-X Nuage Networks ™
The 7850 Service Access Bridge (7850 NSG-X) is optimised for medium, large branch and head office networks to ensure the connectivity required by today's SD-WAN and cloud computing environments.
Based on the most complete SDN (Software Defined Networking) solution in the market, the 7850 NSG-X seamlessly integrates into the Nuage Networks Virtualized Network Services (VNS) SD-WAN solution.
The 7850 NSG-X is used to connect WAN and remote sites to corporate data centers and cloud service providers with optimal network efficiency and configurations managed by the VSP controller (Nuage Networks Virtualized Services Platform).
The solution proposes several scenarios for service, namely VPN layer 2, VPN layer 3, and Internet connection.
The 7850 NSG-X is one of the shape factors taken into account for the NSG component of the Nuage Networks VNS solution, joining the small office (7850 NSG-E) and virtualised (NSG-V), which takes care of the deployment as a piece of software on a client-supplied appliance as a virtual machine.
The 7850 NSG-X has a one-rack-high footprint and can be shipped and installed at an enterprise site without requiring any networking expertise.
Since it is managed centrally, it improves the efficiency and productivity of branch operations while eliminating the need for any IT assistance on site.
The 7850 NSG-X is integrated using a secure start-up process that authenticates with zero, one or two factors depending on the model of trust of the subsidiary and the installation and security posture.
Once started, it allows instantaneous network capacity at the branch.
In addition, the 7850 NSG-X easily connects to any provider's (private, public or hybrid) IP/MPLS network, using its Gigabit (RJ-45 and SFP) WAN ports and 10GbE (SFP +) ports.
The automation capabilities of the network, based on rules, are extended transparently to the branch, which allows users to connect automatically to all applications in any cloud (public or private).
As a result, the supply and consumption of network services are greatly simplified.
In addition, several network functions can be chained in service, and with the help of a routing based on rules, the traffic can be routed to one or more appliances (such as firewalls or IDS / IPS) or virtualized functions at any location before being transferred to the final destination.
For locations with high availability requirements, the 7850 NSG-X can be deployed in a high availability configuration providing resiliency to the peripherals, links and sub-networks.
It also takes care of the redundancy of the uplink connection for the protection of WAN services.
Gigabit and 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports facing the 7850 NSG-X LAN can be used for logical and physical isolation and segmentation of users or applications in order to support the creation of security zones aligned with the company's IT practices.

Municipal Credit of Paris
Hello everyone,
My Thai girlfriend is MtF.
She would like to go to the Paris municipal credit office to secure a few items, including some jewelry.
The problem we are encountering is that a man cannot wager "women's jewelry".
It's a rule that allows you to prevent concealment, I can understand that.
I quote the website: "Without proof of ownership, a man cannot deposit a woman's jewellery as collateral, and vice versa."
We are embarrassed because she has naturally got feminine jewellery but her ID card says "Masculin".
Title deeds for jewellery in Thailand, they don't exist.
The person I spoke to on the phone sounded confused and didn't give me a clear answer.
She said they might accept the deposit of the jewellery.
My girlfriend and I cannot take a day off and travel to Paris on a "perhaps"...
What advice can you give me to argue our case and, above all, what should we do in case of refusal?
I am going to move things because I find it unacceptable.
Thank you in advance
I already had the opportunity to do so yesterday and there has been no change

A free recipe book to help fight food waste every day!
After selection, the best recipe from each region of the country was selected and featured in a free digital cookbook.
It also gathers tips from neighboring countries.
In Belgium, around 345 kilos of food are wasted per person per year, which makes our country the second worst in Europe in terms of food waste, behind the Netherlands.
Worse still, 53% of food waste in Europe happens at home.
And it must be known that food waste accounts for nearly 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions!
The anti-food waste council par excellence: plan your meals by making a shopping list after checking the contents of your fridge and cupboards.
But in this book, entitled "Remix", there are lots of good little dishes to be made from leftovers, classified by season.
Inside, for example, you will learn how to transform fish leftovers into curry, how to poach a few potatoes in water, or how to give second life to stale bread slices.
Here's how to make galettes from leftover purée at home?
Preparation time: 20 minutes.
Ingredients: 500 g of home-made potato purée
- 100 g of Parmesan, cheddar or grated cheese remains
- 1 lightly beaten egg - 2 c. of fresh herb soup (parsley or chives, for example)
- 60 g of flour (2 bowls of 30 g) oil - salt and pepper
- brown sauce, sour cream or spicy sauce (optional)
Preparation: 1.
In a large bowl, mix the cold mash, the grated cheese, the egg, the herbs, 30g of flour, salt and pepper.
Take some dough and roll out some galettes between your hands.
Dust the rest of the flour into a shallow dish, and slide the galettes in on either side.
Lay a fillet of olive oil in a frying pan or a cast-iron pan and heat over a medium-high heat.
Cook the galettes until they are nicely golden (around 3 minutes on each side).
Thank you, not a problem. Thank you for your help, you are 100% ... efficient. Good evening

Palestinians in the West Bank vote in municipal elections: All the latest on liberté-algerie.com
Municipal elections were held in the occupied villages of Cisjordania for two rounds of voting - except in Gaza, where the Hamas ruling movement refuses to hold an election as long as national elections are not called.
No legislative or presidential election has been held in the Palestinian territories for 15 years, but the last municipal elections, already boycotted by Hamas, took place in 2017.
Organised in 376 villages in the West Bank, yesterday's vote is actually taking place in only 154 locations, as no one has declared themselves in 60 towns and only one list of candidates has been registered in 162 other villages.
The polling stations opened at 7am (5am GMT) and closed at 7pm (5pm GMT).
Some 405,000 Palestinian voters were called upon to vote, according to the election commission.
These elections, whose second phase will be held next March, are considered to be devoid of risk, as most candidates are running as independents, and Hamas has refused to take part.
When I want to finalise the purchase, there are images to recognise that appear.
I wait for the bus and then nothing happens.
It never gets to the third stage.

No €100,000 for the winner of Koh-Lanta: Production has the proof of "clandestine dinners" between adventurers
The 20 years of Koh-Lanta are going to sign the end of the flagship game of TF1?
At any rate, the dark affairs of cheating are completely eroding the image of the "legends" of this season All-Stars.
After the scandal of Teheiura's cheating, revealed in the open (he had obtained food from fishermen), here is a second case - revealed by Le Parisien this week - that is shaking the celebrated game of survival.
It is known that the candidates benefited from lavish meals with the Polynesian host.
The production, which had heard about the affair, even responded in kind.
Since a few weeks, we have received oral information that some competitors may have occasionally fed themselves by means that were not in line with the rules of Koh-Lanta, replied ALP, in a press release on Wednesday, indicating that it would continue to lead the investigation to find out if the facts were true.
So far, we have not been able to gather enough elements to confirm or deny this information.
And Adventure Line Productions will continue to strive for fairness ("and no favoritism") between each adventurer.
We have decided to carry out an investigation with the adventurers present on the set but also in Polynesia with local people in order to gather all the information possible on this matter, just as we did after the rumors that were circulating on the set during filming and which concerned Teheiura.
Claude and Laurent broke their silence
Quickly singled out (having lost "only 7 kilos" instead of the usual 15), Claude Dartois responded to Public.
I will not respond to this vendetta against me! he protested, calling for "proof of these accusations."
If Alix thinks that the candidates fingered are "falsely accused", Coumba, on the other hand, does not deny the existence of these infamous clandestine dinners.
As for Laurent Maistret, he defended himself in the columns of TV MAG.
I think I've lost about 10 kilos.
It's funny when I see all these rumors saying I cheated by eating outside the game because it's me who lost the most weight and I felt it.
Nocturnal outings captured by a camera
According to Le Figaro, production found a photo proving the presence of five adventurers during an unauthorized trip.
The cheats went to the Sunset Beach Motel on the island of Raiatea several times on foot, where the animated advice was filmed by Denis Brogniart.
A 45-minute walk along a busy and potentially dangerous road in the middle of the night to reach their hosts who had feasted them and even promised them money after their return to Paris.
Faced with what appears to be one of the biggest scandals in the history of televised games, the final of this Tuesday 14 December in the evening on TF1 risks having an acid taste.
According to Le Figaro, the channel and production are considering "not naming a winner on Tuesday evening or at least not giving the 100,000 euros promised to the winner back".
Did adventurers buy their silence?
Worse, this case of cheating would not only affect a few candidates, but the entire group of adventurers.
Indeed, those who had taken part in the clandestine meals would have brought food back to those who had stayed behind, out of good faith or to buy their silence.
The next episode continues!

Magic electronic eye with double sensitivity equipped with an LCD screen (see photos at the bottom of the text).
With its simple installation, this module can replace any type of circular magic eye, such as the EM34, EM4, 6AF7, etc.
It is powered exclusively by the tension of the filament (6.3 V alternating or 6 to 12 V continuous) as a traditional magical eye and does not require a high voltage.
Its input impedance is very high, greater than 50 MOhm, and does not introduce any disturbance to the circuit to which it is connected.
It is also equipped with numerous possibilities and functions such as:
- A high-performance frequency meter with the possibility of programming an offset frequency in + or - of the measured frequency.
This frequency counter, for example, allows you to display the frequency of the stations received by connecting to the local oscillator of the receiver, the frequency offset will then be programmed with the intermediate frequency value.
- A voltmeter 0 to 800 V
This voltmeter, for example, allows you to know the value of the high voltage of the receiver.
- Programming of colours and mode of display
The eye takes on the appearance and colours you want: simple (without digital indications) or display of all or part of the measurement functions with two sizes of characters to choose from.
- The program is kept in memory even after the power supply is cut off.
The base color is a green identical to the green of the cathode ray tube, the brightness is constant, very comfortable and does not change with time.
Connections are made by wires, an octal plug is available on request, and the end of the eye can be inserted into it.

Different billing from the state of exit
My problem is similar to this one which remains unanswered so I try again :)
**The facts**
I rented an apartment (25 m² habitable) and made an inventory of the state of exit (40 minutes).
During the post-mortem, I indicate directly the things that are not going well.
The owner does the inventory at his own pace.
He tells me he has to buy a damaged piece of furniture, which I accept.
I sign the state of the exit indicating the deduction of the deposit (due to the furniture) and I give him the keys.
The next day, the owner returns to the apartment for a visit.
As a result of this visit, he sends me a message saying that the apartment is dirty and that the tap of the sink is in bad condition (photos to support).
He also tells me that my deposit will be deducted from the cleaning and repair costs.
He offers to come and clean the apartment to avoid paying a cleaner (which I can't do right now).
I called the owner to tell him that I would pay what was in the state of the premises on departure.
Fragen:
* Does a landlord have the right to charge for things that are not on the inventory?
What would you do in my place?
Thank you for your help.

The average number of daily contaminations passes below 15,000
The average number of daily contaminations with coronavirus in Belgium has passed under 15,000 for the first time since mid-November, according to the epidemiological figures from the Institute of Public Health Sciensano, communicated by the minister of health Frank Vandenbroucke's cabinet.
From the 2nd to the 8th December, the average number of new cases was 14,680 per day, a fall of 17% compared to the previous week.
During the same period, close to 700,000 tests were carried out, of which around 116,000 were positive.
The positive rate is 16.6%, stable compared to the last few days.
The number of admissions to hospital is also following a downward trend, with an average of 275 per day between 5 and 11 December.
Naturally, there are now fewer patients in hospital, with 3,283 people having been hospitalised with Covid-19 symptoms as of Saturday.
Only the number of intensive care beds occupied continues its timid progression, with 840 patients in this type of unit on Saturday, against 838 the previous day.
85th day of eruption for the volcano of La Palma in the Canaries
It has now been 85 days since lava has been spewing from the volcano on the Spanish island of La Palma in the Canary Islands, making it the longest eruption of its history since records began in the 16th century.
This volcanic eruption has destroyed numerous houses, buildings and arable land.
Many inhabitants of the island had to be evacuated, but no deaths have been reported so far.
The financial losses, for the agricultural sector and that of tourism in particular, are considerable.
Satellite images taken on Saturday and Sunday showed the holes caused by the lava flows.
The volcano Cumbre Vieja continues to emit strong seismic activity.
Transidentity and bariatric surgery
I (24 ft) started a course for bariatric surgery and I would like to know if one of you has already had the experience as a trans person?
I have been on hormones since October 26.
Is the taking of hormones (androgens in my case) to alter the course of the operation or even surgery itself?
Do I have to talk about my trans identity to my surgeon?
I have the same endocrinologist and psychiatrist for the T as I do for weight.
How does weight loss affect a body that is already going through hormonal changes?
In short, I am looking for testimony from people who have lived the experience, even if it is very difficult or simple.
I'm prepared to put my mum on hold this year for my sleeve.

Commercial partnership micro-entrepreneur
With my partner, we started the micro-enterprise with the desire to create websites, because our skills complement each other.
After some research, the drafting of a commercial partnership agreement seems to be both the simplest and the most stable legally, but on some points, the information available differs:
1. Some sources indicate that the partnership can be continued, i.e. that it can be our only activity, we share the costs, the customers and the premises (in all cases we work from home).
Other sources talk of a one-off partnership, a term that is rather vague to the extent that no frequency or percentage of turnover produced by the partnership is indicated.
There is even talk of a de facto qualification if it is ever proven that it is our sole source of income and that we share the same customers across all our contracts.
2. On the other hand, I read that it is possible to produce a single invoice per project (simpler for the client) and on the other that there must be two invoices, one for each partner.
On these two points, what is true and what is false?
Knowing that my partner and I want to realize different projects in addition (not related to web development), can this then validate the commercial partnership?
And if a commercial partnership seems unrealistic, is there a solution for us to work together on common projects as micro-entrepreneurs?
Thank you in advance for your answers :)
Invest in property with others
I am looking to invest in property with two other people (FYI for the family).
We are all at the beginning of our professional life and the objective is to start to build up savings as soon as possible, while leaving room to be able to realise personal projects if necessary - hence the idea of investing in several and therefore reducing the size of this first property loan.
And this is all the more true because market conditions are particularly favourable for contracting one at the moment!
However, two points:
1. Structuring: I read that there are two main ways to invest in several: joint ownership and SCI.
The first seems "easier, but less flexible" and the second "more complex, but more flexible financially and legally."
In short, not much concrete.
Would you have any experiences to share on these two regimes, and an opinion on which seems most adapted in my case?
2. The process: never having taken out a mortgage, what is the process in general?
In order to get the best deal, I suppose that the best choice is to go through "brokers" / comparator?
In general, would you have any advice on the key stages of an investment in real estate?
Thank you in advance for your answers!
Your ears are welcome :)

Saint Jean de la Croix (died 1591)
Born near Avila in a Castilian family of small artisans and merchants, Jean joined the Carthusians at 20 and spent many years working with Teresa of Avila to reform the order.
Imprisoned by his detractors, he began to write numerous poems, which became famous in Spanish literature.
Sick, he withdrew as a hermit and died in 1591.

An old bomb defused in Berlin, 15,000 people evacuated
Published on Sunday 12 December 2021 at 20:30
Deminers disarmed a 250 kg bomb discovered there three weeks ago during construction works on the site of a hospital - which led to the evacuation of some 15,000 people - in Berlin on Sunday, the Berlin police announced.
Evacuations began on Sunday morning and involved some 15,000 people living in the Gesundbrunnen district of Berlin, in the north of the city, as well as the Jewish hospital and the Red Cross centres, within a radius of 500 metres around the site.
Some 400 policemen went door-to-door during the day to make sure that all residents had left their homes.
They had to insist that some people evacuate.
Police announced in the evening that the bomb had been defused successfully, allowing residents to return to their homes.

Employees at Takeda (Lessines) give blood plasma to get thousands of sick people out of their "permanent confinement"
The company Takeda and the Red Cross work hand in hand to raise awareness of plasma donation.
Every year, the company Takeda processes nearly nine million litres of plasma.
A figure that may seem huge, but which is not enough to meet demand.
We break it down to extract immunoglobulin, a vital substance for patients with immune deficiency, explains Geoffrey Pot, head of the Lessines site at Takeda.
It takes 100 donations to treat one patient for a year.
It is our duty as a large company to do what we can to promote solidarity.
That is why we have introduced "care days".
Days when our 1,200 employees can carry out positive actions for the company.
It is also a good way to foster team building by working together outside the office.
And the blood donation campaign fits perfectly into this framework.
Our company uses plasma as a raw material, and given the importance of the medications that are removed, we thought it was perfectly logical to contact the Red Cross to set up a donation campaign for our employees.

Death due to Covid: insurance, secu and other useless things
Hello everyone,
My father recently died of Covid, probably contracted at work.
We are linking the various and laborious paperwork related to the death, but are adding the joys related precisely to Covid (yes, I say "the" Covid, I'm almost getting used to it), and I would have liked to know if you had any information about this, the questions further down.
A bit of context though:
- He worked in the social sector in a hostel for people with disabilities (not necessarily aware of their situation) (so no medical staff, even if he did help with care)
- Residents have been tested positive for Covid (presumably introduced by a member of staff as they have been confined for a while)
- One of them wanted to give him a hug/kiss, which caused his mask to pop off at the same time (according to what I was told)
- Transmission of Covid
- Positive test at J0, emergency admission at J+5, intubated in the ICU at J+7, numerous complications and setbacks, death at J+49.
Diagnosis of "occupational disease"
The recognition of an occupational disease would give my mother (forced into retirement due to illness) the right to compensation.
The health insurance company has launched an online "declaration of professional illness due to COVID-19" which stipulates the following conditions:
In order for a work-related illness to be recognised, two cumulative criteria must be met: you must have been contaminated in the course of your work, and you must have required the use of oxygen therapy (supply of air enriched with oxygen) or any other form of respiratory assistance.
It is the first point that bothers me: how can I really prove that he really caught it at work?
Indeed, this "proof" is not explicitly requested.
And I doubt that his employer will give me a certificate going that far (although I have not asked for one).
But it makes me furious and I would like the file to be as watertight as possible to have any chance of succeeding (I already have enough paperwork on my hands, so the paperwork just for the pleasure of doing it, no thanks: | )
Assurances and "accidental death"
Two insurance contracts that my father had subscribed to will not apply, at least not entirely, because only the accidental side of the death is retained:
- Funeral insurance contracted less than a year ago, so the total amount is only payable in the event of an accident, and only the premiums already paid are reimbursed (irony of fate, three weeks more and the anniversary date would have been passed, and everything would have been payable)
- Guarantee of the loan of his car (the loan is still ongoing), which in the same way is only activated in case of accident (the small print stipulates "Do not constitute accidents in the sense of the contract: diseases, ailments, bacterial or viral infections (except as a result of an injury), a natural deterioration, degenerative processes")
So I feel the carrot coming, but I would have liked to know if the "pandemic" (and a certain general impotence in the face of Covid) had moved the lines in insurers' minds, if there had been case law on it for a year, this kind of thing: something that might justify that "the Covid is an accident".
I doubt it very much, but I ask the question anyway.
Fragen zum Bonus
In general, Covid or not, if you have in mind the necessary or useful procedures or recommendations or things to avoid, don't hesitate if it can save me a little bit of brain time...
And more generally, take care of yourself and your loved ones, and you might avoid having to ask for help on Reddit like I did.
Thank you for your time.

The young men who fired lead at passers-by in Cannes have been referred
It is still not entirely clear what they were thinking.
How did these three "youths without history", students aged 17 and 18, suddenly decide to fire a gun loaded with lead pellets at passers-by on Friday evening, from the first-floor window of an apartment in Cannes, like in a commonplace video game?
Even without being under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Both adults were handed over to the public prosecutor in Grasse at the end of their custody on Sunday, while the minor was released pending further summons to appear before a juvenile court.
A priori, they will not appear before a court immediately, as it remains to be seen exactly how many victims they have made.
Eight people have already demonstrated to the Cannes police, while the interested parties admitted to having fired at a score of people chosen at random on the Boulevard Carnot, until their interception by law enforcement at around midnight.
One of the victims received lead just below the lips, which caused a bleeding wound.
Same for another one hit on the index.
Another was hit in the shoulder.
This suggests that, with the scope on their rifle, the apprentice "snipers" may have aimed high.
But fortunately, no one seems to have been hit in the eye.
The icon Police does not appear on the last book #NAME#.
It is impossible to adjust the text on the e-reader #PRS_ORG# .
How do you do?

Castres lays down arms against Harlequins
Castres surrendered to Harlequins (20-18), the reigning champions of England, who put up a good fight until the end despite a changed team, on Sunday at the close of the first day of the European Cup.
Trainer Pierre-Henry Broncan from Castries had assured in the week that he wanted to "honour" the European Cup, which the CO was returning after two seasons' absence, and his men made him keep his word.
His team selection, with 13 new players compared to the winners of Racing 92 the week before in the championship (25-3), seemed at odds with the speech.
Several cadres have been rested for the launch of this continental campaign, among which the international number 8 Gaëtan Barlot, the right pilier Wilfrid Hounkpatin, the second row Florent Vanverberghe or the Fijian centre Vilimoni Botitu.
Broncan, who knows rugby well after officiating in the Bath staff, has nevertheless lined up an experienced partnership - Rory Kockott and Benjamin Urdapilleta - to rival that of the Harlequins, perhaps one of the best in the Premiership with Danny Care and Marcus Smith.
The young fly-half, a new pearl of the XV de la Rose, has not always shone on the Pierre-Fabre Stadium pitch, two-thirds full, but his ten points from the tee have made the difference in a tight match.
Castres, after making a tactical U-turn, scored the first try with the Fijian third-row Josaia Raisuqe in the relay of his compatriot Filipo Nakosi, who made an inspired touchdown.
The Harlequins then gradually took control.
First thanks to a try in corner of the wing Louis Lynagh, after a beautiful volley pass of Care.
Then another, from third-row Alex Dombrandt, who burst through the Tarn defence following a tackle.
Martin Laveau, with a full head of steam behind him, gave the Tarn team hope at the end of the match.
But a contentious decision by the arbitrator on the final play will haunt them for a long time.
With this home defeat, the European campaign of the CO, despite the defensive bonus, has already lost its wings before a very dangerous trip to the Irish province of Munster.

COVID-19: A deputy will virtually sit in the legislative assembly
Megan Mitton usually makes the trip to the capital of New Brunswick with her son, who was born a few months ago.
With 412 active cases of COVID-19 in the region, the doctor for the Green Party member advised her to stop going there.
Megan Mitton made a request, which had to be approved by the province's chief medical health officer, Dr Jennifer Russell.
In addition, all the leaders of the Neo-Brunswick parties present in the Legislative Assembly had to give their agreement.
The reason I wanted to have this option if I need it is to make sure that I can continue to do my job, which is to represent the people of my electorate because the other option is just to stay at home and not have the option to participate, but I don't like that option, explains Megan Mitton.
Kris Austin's remarks provoke a reaction
The leader of the New Brunswick People's Alliance, Kris Austin, is one of the people who had to approve Megan Mitton's request to sit remotely.
In an interview with Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, CBC, he said he approved it because it was the last week of the session.
Megan Mitton announced her pregnancy on social media on March 8, 2021, International Women's Day.
Kris Austin's comments have been strongly criticized by Megan Mitton, who called them sexist.
I found it insulting, frankly, because what he said was that there are other members who go to the assembly and do their work, she said.
I went to the assembly and I did my work during the entire session.
Virtual assembly
In addition to the exception granted to Green Party member Megan Mitton for health reasons, Megan Mitton wants members to be able to choose to sit remotely in the future in New Brunswick.
She argues that offering a virtual option with a longer term could attract more women and young parents into politics.
However, the virtual option is not preferred by all parties.
Following several outbreaks of COVID-19 in February 2021, a long debate concerning the virtual legislative works of the Assembly had created numerous debates in Fredericton.
The education minister for the province, Dominic Cardy, had then declared that he would never support such a decision, asserting that the face-to-face in the political arena was a tradition of the best system of governance ever developed by mankind.
The parties had finally sat virtually for a few weeks.
In addition, Megan Mitton also regrets the lack of a parliamentary calendar.
For example, the deputies do not yet know the dates on which they will sit in January 2022.
With the information from CBC's Félix Arseneault and Jacques Poitras

In RN territory, Anne Hidalgo wants to defend the values of the Republic and the primary
Anne Hidalgo, in difficulty in the polls, held her second campaign meeting in Perpignan, a RN town, on Sunday "to defend the Republic and its values," following her call for a left-wing primary "to continue to exist" in the face of the right and the extreme right.
While many, including those on the left, have mocked what they consider to be "a last-ditch proposal" or "a lifeboat," the Socialist candidate wants to prove that she is still there and "determined," despite polls that give her between 3 and 7 percent of voting intentions.
His call for a primary, via the Citizen's Primary movement, which has been advocating a single left-wing candidacy for a year, has so far met with a big "pschitt!" from his main left-wing competitors, who have refused to take part.
But Anne Hidalgo says she is convinced they will change their minds under pressure from "the people of the left", who are "angry".
I hear the French, and in particular those on the left, who say we want this union, + we cannot be in a situation where our choice would be two candidates from the extreme right and two from the right, she explained.
In this context, his meeting in Perpignan, where between 800 and 1,000 people are expected (with mandatory pass and mask), is "an important moment to propose another national narrative than the one that is imposed on us," explains the mayor of Bourg-en-Bresse, Jean-François Debat, close to the candidate.

Coming to Perpignan is a clear choice.
It is not possible to note the violence of the media debate, its right-wing orientation, and not have a strong speech on attachment to republican values: solidarity, tolerance, education, access to culture, equality of chances, summarises Carole Delga, the president of the Occitanie region.
When I see the state of our country, when I see the images of unprecedented violence from last weekend" (during the meeting of Eric Zemmour, ndlr), and "that a racist, xenophobe, and denier is invited, with the table open, without anyone coming to reproach him with his profound lack of respect for our history, it makes me angry," the candidate explained on France 2.
Anne Hidalgo, who likes to repeat that she is a social democrat, in order to remind people of her allegiance to this family, which has enjoyed success in northern Europe, Spain or even Germany, hopes finally to be heard.
We are explained at length that the only theme that counts is that of immigration.
Of course it has to be treated, the question of security too, but today what is damaging our country are social injustices, it is on these that answers must be brought," she insisted.
His entourage promises a short and punchy format.
The candidate should also call on her Spanish roots to talk about the Republican refugees who fled to the region to escape Francoism.
A senior member of the PS, critical, says he hopes she will "demolish" Zemmour's arguments.
′′ You can't just say it's a puppet show ", he insists, referring to the candidate's comments about the far-right provocateur.
She is leading the battle for ideas, confirms Johanna Rolland, her campaign manager.
This meeting takes place the day after the speech of the ecologist candidate Yannick Jadot in Laon.
And even if he has refused the idea of a primary on the left, recalling that he had stepped down in 2017 with "panache" in favor of Benoît Hamon, there is no reason to make a mistake about the enemy.
Our adversary is the right and the extreme right, insists Johanna Rolland.
Will this meeting be Anne Hidalgo's last before she leaves the campaign, as some are whispering?
“You know her badly, she is not the kind to retire, she is ready to retire on one condition, and that is to be beaten in a ballot,” said the PS’s first secretary, Olivier Faure, on RTL.
The train has left.
The popular primary will take place and I will even participate in it if Yannick Jadot does not come, she assured in the JDD, again calling on the ecologist candidate to reflect.
And Anne Hidalgo is convinced that she will win the primary if it really takes place.
No, I don't think so, and I'm sorry, but I'm not really good in IT. My reader says on its #PRS_ORG# that I'm connected and charging, but nothing is happening.
OK, thank you, I will try tomorrow, I was able to buy a book today and since the bank is going to do updates this night, I prefer to wait thank you for your help
Next move!
Hello everyone,
I am going to move to Lyon (and finally leave Paris!) and in this context we have started to think about where we are going to live.
My wife and I have only been to Lyon a few times for weekends as tourists.
We mainly know the central districts.
Do you have any neighbourhoods or towns to recommend?
Or are there places to "avoid"?
In its current state, I thought I understood that in "general":
* the east of Lyon is to be avoided (east of Villeurbanne, Bron, Vénissieux) and a few districts in Lyon (Guillotière and Duchère)
* lots of traffic jams during rush hour in the 9th, A43
* a tax on housing in Villeurbanne
Bundesliga: Joshua Kimmich (Bayer Leverkusen) finally gets vaccinated
Joshua Kimmich will finally be vaccinated against the coronavirus after testing positive, the Bayern Munich player confirmed to German public broadcaster ZDF on Sunday.
It was simply difficult for me to face my fears and my doubts, that's why I hesitated for such a long time, said Kimmich, who had long expressed his doubts about vaccination.
On Thursday, Bayern announced that Kimmich, 26, would not play again this year due to a "slight lung injury" after contracting the virus at the end of November.
He had been in quarantine for a month, first as a contact case before testing positive.
He played his last match on November 6 against Fribourg.

Paternity test (abroad)
Hello, I'm posting here to find out about a DNA test.
I thought it was a subject that could be classified as legal.
I recently learned that it is "possible" that my father is not my biological father.
For some context, my parents separated for a few months before the divorce, during which time my mother was in a relationship with another man (they are no longer in contact).
Chronologically, it is possible that she was pregnant at that time.
But it is also possible that I am my father's biological son, because they reunited just after.
I have found services to make this approach with laboratories.
My dad is willing to do a test with me.
To be clear, nobody is "contesting" anyone's paternity, the idea is to do it for my mother, because she kept the secret in her breast for 20 years.
It does not change anything in the family.
I have to admit that I am even quite impressed by the maturity of the people concerned.
PETIT BEMOL: I live in France, and my parents live in Argentina.
Do you think it would be more clever to use a laboratory located there (receive the kit and send it back) or rather the reverse (that my father does it and sends it back to France)?

The details of Eric Magoni's escape, the most wanted man in France, have been revealed.
According to witnesses, he could be in Spain while the 5 billion euros are still unknown.
Last week, Eric Magoni, who was a trader at SCG and was accused by the bank of losing 5 billion euros, disappeared mysteriously during his transfer to the local prison after giving evidence.
All week, the police refused to give any explanation.
As all of France is still talking about his escape, according to our anonymous source, he had more than one accomplice, including a policeman.
It is understandable that the police van transporting the most wanted man in France had a traffic accident and was hit by a black jeep.
According to witnesses, a policeman made him get out of the pickup truck and got him into the jeep.
While the fugitive was changing vehicles, two men armed with the black jeep opened fire on the pickup truck, hitting it 12 times.
Two of the three policemen who were monitoring Magoni have been found fatally injured, while the other policeman has not been found.
The young policeman on the run, called Javert, has always been thought to be Magoni's accomplice.
The last sighting of the black jeep was on the AP-7 motorway and the police believe Magoni and his accomplices have already left the country.
It is thought that the police will make an official statement and contact Interpol for an international arrest warrant."
Shutdown of the German-Russian gas pipeline in case of "escalation" in Ukraine
The new German-Russian gas pipeline Nord Stream II, controversial Nord Stream II will not be allowed to function in the event of a new "escalation" in Ukraine, according to an agreement reached between Berlin and Washington, the head of German diplomacy said on Sunday evening. Due to the tense security situation, "it was agreed between the Americans and the former German government" of Angela Merkel "that in case of a new escalation, this gas pipeline could not enter service," Annalena Baerbock said on the German television channel ZDF, when Westerners fear an invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops.
The Foreign Minister, who participated over the weekend in a meeting of the G7, among other things, on tensions with Russia and will discuss the subject with her European partners on Monday, has thus specified the threats - often veiled - launched by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz about Nord Stream II.
The Foreign Minister, who took up her post last week, also recalled that the gas pipeline linking Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, "in any case, cannot be permitted at the moment, as it does not meet the rules of European energy legislation".
In mid-November, the German energy regulatory authority suspended the certification process for Nord Stream II – whose construction was completed – requesting that the consortium based in Switzerland, and responsible for its operation, create a German law company.
This gas pipeline, strongly supported by the head of state of Russia, Vladimir Putin, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, by Angela Merkel in recent years, on behalf of the guarantees of gas supply for Europe, is very controversial among many countries.
The USA and several Eastern European countries, starting with Poland, are worried about an excessive dependence of Europe on Russia under Putin.
In addition, Ukraine, until now one of the major transit countries for Russian gas to Europe, fears that it will pay the price for this project, which is bypassing it and economically and diplomatically weakening it.
For the time being, the head of German diplomacy has called for concentration on diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions between Ukraine and Russia.
We are in a phase right now where we want to do everything to get the discussions going again, because dialogue is the best way to avoid an escalation, she said.
Julian Assange suffered a "micro-AVC" in prison, according to his fiancée
Mme Moris, mother of two little boys who she had with Julian Assange, declared that this happened on October 27th, on the first day of the hearing of an appeal by the United States against the refusal to extradite the founder of Wikileaks, who Washington wants to try for a massive document leak.
Julian Assange has been imprisoned in a high-security prison near London for two and a half years, and his arrest by the British police in April 2019 after spending seven years in the London embassy of Ecuador, where he had taken refuge while on bail.
He must be released.
Now," Mme Moris tweeted on Saturday evening.
The Mail on Sunday reported that Julian Assange, 50, had suffered an "ischemic transient accident", in which blood supply to part of the brain is temporarily interrupted.
This caused him memory loss and signs of neurological damage and his right eyelid drooped.
He has been taking medication since then, according to the newspaper.
This revelation about Mr Assange's state of health comes after a major victory for the United States in its battle to extradite the founder of WikiLeaks, the High Court canceling on Friday a first instance decision which opposed it.
Nevertheless, Julian Assange intends to lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court.
The United States accuses Mr Assange of having released, since 2010, more than 700,000 classified documents on US military and diplomatic activities, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa tests positive for Covid-19
Published on Sunday 12 December 2021 at 22:33
The head of state of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday and was placed in isolation, the presidency announced.
President Cyril Ramaphosa is being treated for mild Covid-19 symptoms after testing positive for the virus today, the presidency announced late in the evening in a statement, but did not specify if it was the new Omicron variant detected in South Africa last month.
There are still many unknowns about this new form of the virus, which has undergone numerous mutations, but according to initial observations by scientists, it would be more contagious.
Researchers are still questioning the effectiveness of vaccines.
In isolation in the Cape, in the south of the country, "the head of state's responsibilities have been delegated to Vice-President David Mabuza for the week ahead," the presidency said.
The president began to feel unwell after leaving earlier in the day the official ceremony at the Cape in honour of the late president Frederik de Klerk who died in November, the statement continued.
M. Ramaphosa participated in the morning homage, which brought together around 200 people in a church in the Cape.
The ceremony today took place in accordance with sanitary rules, the presidency assured, adding that people who have been in contact with the president are invited to monitor the appearance of symptoms or to get tested.
The 69-year-old head of state, who is fully vaccinated, is being followed by the army's health services.
Cyril Ramaphosa has recently made an official visit to four countries in West Africa, during which he underwent regular tests.
On his return to South Africa on December 8, he tested negative.
President Ramaphosa wants his own infection to serve as a warning to all citizens of the country to get vaccinated and stay alert, according to the statement.
The Omicron variant is now responsible for the vast majority of contaminations in the country, which has seen an exponential rise in cases since its emergence.
South Africa is officially the African country most affected by the pandemic.
The country has more than 3.1 million contaminations, including more than 90,000 deaths.

What is Tornado Alley, the tornado corridor in the United States?
Where is Tornado Alley?
Generally, this Tornado Alley is associated with states a little more to the west, such as Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Iowa or Missouri.
But it can also include some parts of Texas, Colorado, Louisiana, Minnesota, and a few other neighboring states, including Kentucky and Illinois.
According to the National Climatic Data Center, Illinois is actually the fifth U.S. state to be hit the most between 1991 and 2010, with 9.7 tornadoes per year on average.
Within these states, construction standards are stricter than in the rest of the United States.
The roofs are reinforced, as are the connections between the buildings and their foundations, and numerous tornado shelters are built in the vicinity or within the buildings.
There are two types: underground shelters, situated underground or in the garden, or what is known as a "strong room", i.e. a room in the house built of reinforced concrete and able to resist high winds.
Measures of protection that avoid more and more deaths every year.
What meteorological conditions cause these tornadoes?
These regions are particularly exposed because they are located at the confluence of different masses of air: the continental cold masses coming from the Canadian prairies, the dry air of the Sonora desert and the warm and humid air coming from the Gulf of Mexico.
Another important factor, the relief of these states favors a strong variation of winds.
The encounter of these masses of air creates very unstable conditions and favors thunderstorms with a very high vertical extension and therefore tornadoes.
Generally, the regions in the north are the most affected in spring and summer with the rise in temperatures.
Conversely, regions in the south are more at risk of being hit during the autumn season.
But the central states can be affected throughout the year due to the large variations in temperatures.
