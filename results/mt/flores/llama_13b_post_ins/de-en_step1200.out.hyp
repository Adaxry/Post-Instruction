USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts it as an absolute necessity that the Olympic family advocates for a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the USOC that the interests of our athletes and clubs and their sport are better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization rather than decertification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were brown on top and pale or carrot-colored on the underside.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, which is called the rachis, but do have other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for regulating temperature or for display. The researchers suspected that the sample, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, showed the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult and not downy feathers.
A car bomb detonated in the police headquarters of Gaziantep, Turkey, on the morning of the previous day, killing two police officers and wounding over twenty other people.
According to the governor's office, nineteen of the injured are police officers.
The police said they suspected a militant supporter of Daesh (ISIL) behind the attack.
They have discovered that the sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: It was discovered that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
To determine the Rossby number of a star, which is associated with the plasma stream, the luminosity and rotation are taken into account together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of flipping its magnetic field.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also exerts attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter behaves on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter is located in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

“They are cooler during the day than the surrounding surface, and warmer at night.”
Their thermal behavior is not as even as the large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it does agree that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and stick a pre-printed sheet of paper, on which the candidate of their choice is printed, into an envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the list of voters.
The French election law lays down the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that at the start of the election there are no envelopes and that no envelopes are thrown away, other than those of the properly counted and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives who can attend as witnesses for each part of the process. At night, the voices of volunteers are counted under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

She finished her other race, the giant slalom, in 10th place in the women's group with a combined running time of 4:41.30. This put her 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who took ninth place.
Four cross-country skiers did not finish, and 45 of the 117 cross-country skiers in the giant slalom were not able to place in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh have found the stolen laptop and the mobile phone again.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and secured her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police President Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car drove in, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Meanwhile, Adekoya was charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody until her trial, but witness statements may have been distorted because her picture was widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have regarded the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee says: "It seems that journalists are crossing a dangerous line when they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is leading the criminal investigation, has suggested to journalists that no further comments will be made until charges are brought.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute, in which the Palestinians demand a return of the borders to the state before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics that are supposedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian authority wants to accept such a presence for only five years.
The shooters of the accompanying experiment to curb the plague were to be closely supervised by officers, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
Within the scope of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (New South Wales) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the executive director of Park Conservation and Heritage in the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the non-implementation of elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating in defective iPods have been reported. As a result, six fires were triggered and four people suffered from minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the postponement by Apple "really regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Civil Defense of the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by kidnapping their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an older lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature contractions in his free time.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that investigators had recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Ringer colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels made the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I ... maybe even crazier ... I love her and will miss her ... I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the proportion of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the then acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of those surveyed said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist in the Olympic Games was supposed to swim in the disciplines of 100 m and 200 m Freestyle, as well as in three relay teams, but due to his many complaints, his fitness was called into question.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the Earth, together with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago, scientists promise insights into how planets, especially the Earth, are formed.
Cuomo (53) took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last month.
He described the rumors as "political chatter and foolishness."
It is speculated that he could run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older technology based on ground radar to allow air traffic controllers to more precisely locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be provided and the overground trains will not stop in Wembley. There are no parking spaces or park and ride facilities available on site.
With concerns about a lack of transportation options, the likelihood grew that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within just two generations, even though it was previously assumed that this process would take much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into many different forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin and stuck to other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate books with hand-painted pictures, called picture manuscripts.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on how sour or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which their electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels funny and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost every house equipped with a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Even in ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, which men and women visited in mixed company.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It requires a gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to shoot a satellite or a telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest service that the bicycle has rendered us is much simpler and faster transport.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other transport means.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
After all, there are still many small cats (including free-roaming house cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the niche concept, a special task that every cat has and which ensures that it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups, called prides.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Women normally have a close relationship with each other if they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are equally deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not particularly well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar does not sound like the lion's full-throated roar, but rather like a series of growled words.
Ozelots eat small animals. When they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots hunt their prey (prey) with their sense of smell and track it down. They then sniff where they stopped on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and can move undetected. Ozelots hunt their prey by matching their appearance to their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
If a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population needs other characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor, different from what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans breathe out (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food through photosynthesis. They also donate shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothing from plants. We mainly eat plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurus.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, plus another set at the throat, meaning there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. It fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have even been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was not too big for him.
While most of their diet would have been familiar to us, the Romans did partake in some curious or unusual banquet foods, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of shrew known as a hedgehog.
Another difference was that poor people and women ate their food while sitting on chairs. Rich men, on the other hand, preferred to hold common banquets, where they reclined on the side while eating their meals.
Courts in ancient Rome could not contain any food that came from America or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
They did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolate, and no Roman has ever eaten a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
Man brought offerings to the gods and the priests tried to comply with the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, zikkurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
The majority of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard. Shops were simply open-fronted stalls. Stone was used for the house construction.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so that wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland because of murder. When he continued westward, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But independent of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence contains a treasure map.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" were written. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for certain who wrote it, but it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of its life.
It is therefore possible that the note was simply added as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
He was dominated by the "Vichy" French. These were Frenchmen who had concluded peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them."
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
After only two weeks, the Americans and French liberation forces had freed southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an independent culture that is shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also somehow defines the size of a society.
Municipalities are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next, a lasting cultural footprint, and reasonable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the revolutionary war, the 13 states first formed a weak central government based on the federal treaty, which only consisted of the Congress.
The Congress was not authorized to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the authorities of the states to enforce all its laws, which often did not cooperate.
He also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian football national team, together with the German football national team, is the second most successful in the world and was FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands, Japan is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
The beginning of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company founded a subsidiary in the southwest of Taiwan, thereby initiating a change in the native Taiwanese rice cultivation methods and employing Chinese workers on their sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the government of the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored by 1976, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used film format in the world is 35 mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its image format was adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In actual fact, the so-called 35 mm format measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore described as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often ridiculed thirds rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamics and at the same time preserves some order in an image.
It states that the intersection point of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence dominated everyone, from the king to the simple citizen.
One of the important Christian articles of faith states that property should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that this is the reason the church has money.
The central power of the Church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was being complied with.
Shortly after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a sea blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective as it cut off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated the generally recognized international law, which had been codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sea areas, which was a danger to neutral ships as well.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the predominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After experiencing the horror and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a position at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his superior at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different eras. Every period in China and every family that was in power was its own dynasty.
Between the individual dynasties, there were also unstable periods of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times, bitter wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The time of the three kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the fight for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a move away from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just a ruler.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male candidates, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same applied to the military: instead of being based on social class, the army rank lists were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things beyond everyday life. He often visited a cave on the mountain of "Nur" (Light), known as "Hira," to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a lively picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is quite difficult to find, even if you know it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
One sees nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the interior of the cave, one can see or hear little of the outside world.
The Cheops pyramid is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small graves, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The "coating" symbol looks like a V and the "stripping" symbol like a bracket or a square, in which the lower stroke is missing.
Up means that you start at the top and push the bow. Down means that you start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Strumming usually generates a softer sound, while picking is louder and more expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; but remember that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons, and should normally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two little children (the 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who shouted threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At some point, a member of the angry crowd swung the head of a killed royal guard in front of the eyes of the horrified queen in Versailles.
The war expenses of the US imperialists during the conquest of the Philippines were carried by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of their expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits, which were the result of the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people, were the fundamental profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic that is connected with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are more inherent than social.
One can claim, for example, that the automobile inevitably brings about the development of roads.
However, a national road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. This is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare sector for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, which was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it was geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography, and these were better than arbitrary laws because they were in harmony with the place of society.
Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined over the course of the 12th century, due above all to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world also wandered from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east.
However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing as a result of the Crusades.
Needs-based agriculture is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to cover the needs of the farmer or farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological form of farming that uses saved, locally adapted seed stock and combines crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures bring like-minded people together who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differentiate themselves from others in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through an unmistakable and symbolic style, including fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
′′ Such children are called ′′ feral ′′ or wild. Some feral children were held captive by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the inability of the parents to accept the significant intellectual or physical limitations of the child."
Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
If it has been raised by animals, the wild child exhibits behavior (within its physical capabilities) that is almost completely in line with that of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, "scaffolding" goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real. In other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold, but also the little office clerk in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is integrated into the software and should call into question work steps that the student may not be able to handle alone, suggest and explain.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the care system is a piece of security for these children.
Our foster care system should offer a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
The care station should cover all needs that were not met in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet connects both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions with regard to the benefit and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal engagement" and "enduring relationships" as new motivational aspects when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important findings for the interpretation of microexpressions, brief facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting minor changes in facial expression.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks showed how people who can no longer understand language because of a brain injury can still accurately assess the honesty of others.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation causes new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation.
Out in the savanna, it's hard for a primate with a digestive system like ours to get enough amino acids from available plant sources.
There are also serious consequences if it is neglected: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been proteins in leaves and seeds, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein, which contain all essential amino acids.
In total, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savanna do it today.
Sleep inertia is the process of purposefully waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly (10-60 minutes) later.
This can easily be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you.
If you're someone who hits the snooze button in their sleep, you could put it on the other side of the room so you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another possibility based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that one is forced to get up to urinate.
The level of inner calm a person possesses correlates inversely with the level of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the available vital energy. Every human being has the potential to find absolute rest and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras opened, and enlightened consciousness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of the systems, the course, and the culture led the countries to become enemies.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It should last for the next 40 years and be carried out in reality by deputy armies on the battlefields of Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already completely collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and a new deployment along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost rendered obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union poured into the White Russian and Ukrainian fronts, creating them after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large quantities of people and goods over the oceans.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains capable of transporting people and goods, while at the same time hindering the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War. The Americans tried to bring staff and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain, just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep them as domestic animals to obtain their milk, fur, meat and skin easily.
House goats were normally kept in herds that wandered over hills or other pastures. The goats were tended by goatherds, much like the better-known sheep herders; often they were children or adolescents. These pasture practices are still in use today.
In the 16th century, England had already built promotional tracks.
Although the guide rails were made of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull greater loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Soon, thresholds were introduced to secure the position of the rails. Gradually, however, it was realized that rails carrying a band of iron were more efficient.
This was common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means "upright man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as often.
Two-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate some future suffering.
This is often only a symptomatic treatment. However, if you don't just want temporary solutions, we should find the root of the problem and treat it.
It is really obvious that the world has changed significantly due to scientific and technological progress, and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings have become more serious.
After its adoption by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the print shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript did not survive the times.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Nearly all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
It is possible that an internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, for example, vomiting, are so general that one cannot immediately make a diagnosis.
The best sign of poisoning by swallowing can be the presence of an open container with medication or poisonous household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term "Wanze" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adaptable at parasitizing humans.
Both bedbugs and cockroaches are nidicol, i.e. adapted to living in nests or the dwellings of their hosts.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most widespread neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that the probability of women getting MS is twice as high as that of men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take on parenthood.
The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations.
However, it is not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that helps to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and conducting observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were recognized.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of body-owned cycles and their production by biological clocks. x
Behavioral patterns determined by a cycle, which are not just reactions to external cycles, are known in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even execute free-running cycles for a while in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key indications that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to introduce their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has, and whether the affected cells are stem cells.
Only mutations in stem cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting nature areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is a visit to photograph and study orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small provincial towns by car to go to work and are passed by others whose workplace is in the place they are just leaving.
In this dynamic pendulum traffic, all are in some way connected to a transport system based on the private car and support it.
The science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in the society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such shortcomings, why do they fail daily? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, as one cannot predict driver behaviour with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a somewhat consistent manner; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with planning, designing and operating facilities on the roadway.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a broader selection of small hideouts where they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the center of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, doesn't it, since it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving?
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes up to six miles wide.
An entire 20 percent of the water that flows through the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It takes in water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their forefathers, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since antiquity, since these can be found in their original form in nature and can be mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponds more to the four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also put forward the theory that they change into new substances in order to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic system.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit at the end of this sentence.
According to this, the pencil was a good friend to many people after its invention.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to the background, so that it has been pushed back in its status and its use.
Today, people write news on computer screens without ever having to come close to an editor.
It will be exciting to see what comes of the keyboard when something newer arrives.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Something like driving a heavy truck up a hill. If the core is split again, part of this energy will be released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate even at low or no impact.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more Maria, since the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what motivates and appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories deal with what causes certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not do them.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of need hierarchy and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behavior patterns can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to "be one of the boys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently from how the team has done it and who takes everything personally.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are led according to the same excellence standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be taken into account by the local leadership.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the leadership team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively used by all departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can emerge.
As a result, the joint work of an organization on overcoming a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. Thus, they limit the research area and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage such as trauma, injuries and tumors influence behavior and change some brain functions.
New technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our heads.
Although strongly associated with science fiction, KI is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI includes the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, the setting up of strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer queries and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
Today, KI systems are frequently used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering and the military, and have also been built into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any school class. Teachers often want to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. The students can view museum exhibits from the classroom, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital every year. The website is redesigned every year, but previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students may have a shaky grasp of grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, that usually improves when they have an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blogger makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
The blogging "forces the students to learn more about the world around them." The need to interest the audience inspires the students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively reacting to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and present their own perspectives on certain topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, characterized by a series of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the untouched beauty of nature in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more mark Ontario as what outsiders consider typically Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprised many: There are more African Americans in the USA than in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as far as the animal world is concerned, a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and it was very successful on the Comoros and in Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is limited by the Sahel zone and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as an attack, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stay consistent if you reject men, and don't be afraid to defend your position (regardless of cultural differences; that doesn't mean it's okay!)
The current Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century before the era and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name Casa Branca, only to give them up after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places around the old Medina where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tajines are sold, but that is all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, including the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any stay outside Goma should be carefully planned to learn about the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo and for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Together with its relative inaccessibility, this has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, far-off countries.
Although Timbuktu is known as a tourist attraction and has an airport, it is now a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world cultural heritage sites due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the most important stations of Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting a different animal world.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily entrance fees.
It can also be worth buying a wild card that gives access to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name giver for the territory of Hong Kong and is in the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared to a shimmering balcony diagram that is visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The bulk of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed along the north coast on reclaimed land.
This is the place where the British colonists have made a home for themselves. If you are looking for traces of the colonial past of the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove belt in the world and stretches over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which a third is covered by water and marshland.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that around 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer live there now.
Buses drive all day from the district bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Since the buses between districts are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are covered by small Japanese coach buses that are comfortable and stable.
Taxis offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l' Oyapock in French Guiana.
Their two towers are 83 meters high, their length is 378 meters and they have two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 metres. The construction works were completed in August 2011, but the opening for traffic did not take place until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs control points will then be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited today's eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also the home of other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the Province of the West Indies, emerged in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors with the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for its polo team and players being among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at Las Cañitas Polo Fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be viewed at other times of the year.
For information on competitions and sales outlets for polo tickets, visit the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is set in line with the value of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island, which is located opposite the FIC West Store in Stanley.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley credit cards. US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are probably not accepted on the remote islands, but British and US currency may be accepted; ask the owners in advance which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below the freezing point, but wind and humidity lead to it feeling colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no pronounced rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authority's instructions, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, wapiti, elk, bears and almost all large animals can be, it can happen that they attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild and possibly dangerous, so give them enough space.
Also be aware that smells can attract bears and other wild animals. So avoid carrying strong-smelling foods with you or cooking with them, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 50s of the 18th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an embarrassing standoff between the navy and seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain in 1889, when the ships refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk. Almost 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the killing of the highest chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III
Since Auckland stretches over two ports, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most are sandy beaches with safe swimming and most offer shade, provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a beautiful shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps more compatible.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you are worried, you can also easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a "Flat White" is foreign. A small black coffee is an "espresso," a cappuccino is filled with whipped cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of the authorities and pay attention to all signs, especially safety warnings.
Square jellyfish are found in coastal areas and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally also occur outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
A booking in advance gives the traveller the certainty that they have a place to stay after they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
You can also hold your reservation for you, if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain additional documents for your travel destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or inquiries should first be addressed to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that music will continue to be played on some stages until late at night, even if the music on the main stages has stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you're crossing the North Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, as breaking ice can cause a pretty terrifying noise for those most affected.
The cruises to St. Petersburg also allow time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions).
Casinos usually try very hard to keep guests on the premises for as long as possible and to get them to spend as much money as possible. There are usually no windows, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have a special menu of food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests happy and ensure they return.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who wants to drive in high altitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice and temperatures below the freezing point.
On icy and snow-covered roads, liability is low and one cannot drive as if one were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be affected by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic runs mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" is commonly used to describe a land journey to observe the overwhelming African animal world, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and the standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, giraffes and leopards are often shy and you can observe them better with binoculars.
A foot safari (also called "bush walk," "walking safari," or "footing") consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Olympic summer games, after it hosted the games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most cancellation policies were not in effect until July 2020, the date of the Olympics.
It is assumed that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with an average ticket costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothing can help with drying. Many hotels lend irons and ironing boards, even if you're not in your room.
If an iron isn't available or you don't want to wear pressed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful that the material does not get too hot (this can make it shrink or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are various methods for cleaning water. Some of them prove to be more effective in counteracting certain dangers.
In some areas, water only needs to be boiled for a minute, while in others it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers can come across animal pests that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Ungeziefer can destroy food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, administer poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with violence are usually not classified as vermin.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and consumption taxes in certain places.
Travelers whose destination has a high tax rate can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is probably the largest driving challenge, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep gradients, narrow lanes and sharp bends are the norm here.
The speed limits indicated are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56 - 64 km/h) - and their strict enforcement is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, the mobile phone coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the line, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.

Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the island group, offers a variety of simply spiced dishes. Javanese people prefer to use peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially palm sugar) and a range of aromatic spices as a flavour enhancer.
Stirrups are aids for the rider's feet, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet could potentially get stuck in them.
If a rider falls from his horse and gets his foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged along if the horse bolts. To keep this risk to a minimum, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, very narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety straps that allow a girth strap to fall from the saddle as soon as it is pulled back by a falling rider.

Downhill sports like skiing and snowboarding are popular sports where you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and slide down a snow-covered slope.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes also known as "ski bums," who plan their entire holiday around skiing in a certain location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings with depictions of skiers go back as far as 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first leisure ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skiing with a backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski mountaineering.
It resembles alpine ski touring or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include the latter, as the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions, you are able to cover greater distances than when walking - but you very rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing on groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but has numerous independent countries. Normally, one would have to apply for multiple visas and go through several passport controls if one wanted to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area, however, functions a little like a country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can normally cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no general definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition includes geographical variations, where the age limit can be lower in regions such as North America.
Handmade products could be described as "antique" even though they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Raising reindeer is an important source of income for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many who work in other professions.
In the past, not all Sámi have bred reindeer on a large scale, but have lived off fishing, hunting and other activities. They mainly kept reindeer as draught animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.

They can also consult the advice of other governments than their own. However, their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with other situations than Europeans or Arabs.

The views presented are often superficial, general and, compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere, too simplified.
Unwetter is the collective term for every dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.

Anyone planning to travel to a country considered a war zone should undergo professional training for it.
A search on the Internet for "Course on hostile environments" will probably show the address of a local company."
A course usually covers all the discussed problems in much more detail, normally in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing games, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on surviving in the wilderness, but only a few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid ID documents for their return journey.

Security checks have also become much more intrusive since 9/11.
Transgender people should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact when passing through the scanner before their operation.
Riss-Strömungen are the returning stream of waves that have broken on the beach, often at reefs or similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper areas and a fast current can form there.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which can prove to be impossible.
If you get out of the current, the backstroke is not more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won't be caught. Alternatively, if you can't get away, and depending on your abilities and whether you were spotted, you may have to wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more serious.

When you return home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and put aside some behaviors of your home culture.
When you travel abroad for the first time, people are probably patient and understanding because they know that travelers have to adapt to a new country.
One might not expect that returning travellers would also require patience and understanding.

Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, which is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.

The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak, Mount Vinson, is 4892 meters high.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
In general, a satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside and in line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including cruise ships, as well as expeditions that need data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off are study and course offers abroad.

In most cases, a fee is charged for registration to these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat tours. The "land of a thousand lakes" has thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht to explore the archipelago and lakes.
Even if the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are large enough for every yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, and every sixth or eighth person owns a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most pure Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several days in a row, while returning to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only go ashore during the boat excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin in Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.

If they sent things by air freight, the unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to speed it up was to send it as abandoned luggage. Airlines' rules do not allow luggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The easy way to fly first or business class is to cough up a wad of cash for the privilege (or, better still, get your own company to pick up the tab).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, it makes little sense to look for discounts on direct flights from A to B for business or first class seats.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and demand corresponding prices.
The capital of Moldova is Kischinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.

Normal announcements in the metro are made exclusively in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are reported by an automated system in a number of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Paris is said to be egotistical, unpolite and arrogant.

The brusque exterior of Parisians disappears very quickly when you practice basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, with mainly beeches, firs and pines, and offers a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
