This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers - a theory that has been widely accepted - but also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists said that the top of the feathers of this animal is olive green, and the bottom is pale or purple.
This discovery also helps to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
The dinosaur's feathers did not develop well - this is called the "feather axis," but it still has other feather characteristics, such as feather branches and feather twigs. Researchers infer that the evolution of the feather axis may be later than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or display. The researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature feathers, not baby feathers.
The researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers, not downy feathers.

Schneider made a video testimony at the USAF base in his motherland.
In addition to the game on Wednesday, Carpanedo also participated in two individual competitions in the javelin competition.
Her first project was to overcome her fear of snow, and she ended the first round with a "not completed" score. Among the 116 contestants, 36 of them had the same score.
Her other event was the 400 individual medley, where she finished 10th in 4:41.30, 2:11.60 behind first-placed Aussie Olympian Kylie Palmer and 1:09.02 behind ninth-placed Hungarian Zsuzsanna Jakabos.

However, the driver's head was seriously injured.
The road was temporarily closed after the accident, and emergency rescue personnel rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially sent to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth for treatment.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
After that, Adkia was charged with the murder of her son and was tried at the Edinburgh High Court.
She was detained pending trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be undermined because her image has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judicial system is different, and the court believes that publishing the photos may cause potential harm.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, pointed out: "If the reporter publishes the suspect's photo and other information, it seems that there is a threat."
The Royal Prosecutor's Office, which filed the lawsuit, told reporters that it would not make further comments before filing a lawsuit.
According to the disclosure, this document will mention the border dispute, and Pakistan hopes to base the boundary on the 1967 Middle East war.

Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in as a member of the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is the fifth time that Martelly has been elected to the CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Committee recommended the resignation of the former CEP, which is part of the process of promoting the country to adopt new election measures.
The committee is a response by Martelly to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, due to some elections not being held as scheduled, these protests have sometimes escalated into violent incidents.
It is reported that about 60 iPods have failed and overheated, resulting in 6 fires and 4 minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (METI) said it had noticed 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported 34 other overheating incidents to the ministry, although the company described the incidents as "not serious."
The Ministry of Industry and Trade responded that it was "very regrettable" that Apple delayed the report.
The earthquake in the Maldives occurred at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time on Friday).

Dustin Runnels, whose ring name is Goldust, commented, "It's hard to catch up with her... She may be even harder to catch up with... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she goes to a better place."
It surveyed 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election. The number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II stepped down.
34% of the respondents said they hoped that Queen Elizabeth II would become the last monarch of Australia.
There are two extremes in the voting situation. 29% of the respondents believe that Australia should establish a republic as soon as possible, while 31% of the people believe that Australia should never establish a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in three relay races, including the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and the Commonwealth Games, but his health has been in question because of his complaints.
He has been unable to use medication to relieve the pain because the competition bans the use of these drugs.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest known prime number on January 25.
In early February, several people used different hardware and software to verify this discovery and announced it on Tuesday.
Voyager may be the source of water and organic matter on Earth, which can form proteins and maintain the continuity of life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form since the time of the collision between the star and the earth, especially the formation of the earth.
Cuomo, 53, has been governor since the beginning of this year, and he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the accusation "political slander and foolish behavior."
It is predicted that he will run for President in 2016.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said that the new generation of air transport system (NextGen) can shorten the flight route of aircraft, save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite technology instead of old-fashioned ground radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
Without additional transportation facilities, the subway does not stop at Wembley, and there is no parking lot or parking lot change facility on the ground.
Due to concerns about a lack of transportation, the game may be forced to close its doors without team supporters.
On Thursday, a study published in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from the University of Princeton in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden reported that the new species had only evolved for two generations due to the crossbreeding between the native Darwin's finch and the introduced large-beaked finch. Although people thought that this process would take longer time.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be rolled into a small shape.
It can be drawn into fibers and used for binding and weaving. It can also be beaten or ground into a powder.
It can be made very thin, sticking to other metals. Because it is so thin, it can sometimes be used for the hand-drawn illustrations in decorated books, which are called "illustrated books."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can use red cabbage juice as an indicator.
The color of the vegetable soup will change according to the acidity of the chemical substances.
The pH value is expressed by the number of hydrogen (H) ions in the chemical substance (pH).
The hydrogen ion is a particle that has lost an electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of a particle and an electron).
Stir the two flours together, then use a clean, damp hand to knead them into a ball.
The water on your hand will react with the outer layer to form a layer similar to the outer shell, which is very interesting.
Almost every household in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a well, which was connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Traces of a sewage system have been found in houses in the Greek island of Crete and the city of Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, the toilet was part of the mixed public bathroom for men and women.
When you call someone far away, you will use a satellite.
After receiving a call from a satellite in space, it is almost immediately reflected back.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere bends some light and distorts some views.
To send satellites or telescopes into space, a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed.
The car has changed the world in an unimaginable way. The biggest contribution of the car to us is to make our transportation more convenient.
With it, we have trains, cars and many other transportation tools.
Beneath them are more medium-sized felines, which eat medium-sized prey such as hares, antelopes, and deer.
In the end, many small mammals, including domestic cats, feed on insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their successful secret is Liki's concept. Each cat is responsible for a special job to prevent them from competing with other cats.
The lion is the most obvious feline animal that lives in a large group called a pride.
The lion group consists of one to three adult male lions and up to 30 females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters in the family, women usually have close relationships with each other.
The behavior of lions is very similar to that of wolf packs or dog packs. These animals behave in a way that is strikingly similar to that of lions (but unlike other large felines), and these behaviors are lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a multi-talented athlete. It can climb (although its climbing ability is not strong), swim and jump far. Its pulling power is five times that of a human strongman.
Lions, tigers, and jaguars belong to the same genus (Panthera). These four big cats are the only cats that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as deep as the roar of a lion, but more like a burst of excited speech.
Leopards like to eat small animals. If the conditions allow, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. The prey of leopards is almost smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that the American jaguar uses scent and sniffing to track and find prey on the ground.
Their night vision is very strong, they can see very clearly in the dark, and their movements are also very secretive. The leopard's hunting method is to first blend into the surrounding environment and then rush to the prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from their main population (for example, they cross a mountain range and a river, or they reach a new island where they can no longer return), they usually find that their environment is different from before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptability to become a strong competitor, rather than the ones they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, and they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
With the passage of time, new populations began to adapt to the new environment, and they began to become more and more different from other populations.
After going through thousands or even millions of years, these two species will finally become different, so that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process "speciation" or the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result of evolution and is also an extremely important part of evolution.
Plants can produce oxygen that humans can inhale and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to make houses and use plants to make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Carcharodon is the top predator in that age, and it is not afraid of anything.
Its lower jaw was full of more than 70 conical teeth, and its upper jaw also had one row. This means that anything it encountered was doomed.
It may have a bifurcated tongue, and we are not certain of this. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, other crocodiles, and even humans.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even giant monsters such as the king of dragons are not its opponents.
Although most of the food eaten by Romans is familiar to us, they did indeed have some strange or uncommon menu items, including wild boar, ostrich, buffalo, and a type of shrew known as a hedgehog.
Another difference is that the poor and women sit on chairs to eat, while the rich like to gather together to hold a banquet and eat lying down.
A few centuries later, food from the Americas or Asia could not have appeared in the diet of the ancient Romans.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or chocolate, and no Roman has ever eaten fried chicken.
Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods and considered it the residence of the god.
People will offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests will fulfill the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Every shrine has an open courtyard and an inner shrine that only priests can enter.
Some special pagodas have a pagoda shape and are called pagodas. They are built as part of the temple.
The top of the mountain is a special sacred place of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house is not important.
The life of the Chibi family is mostly spent outdoors.
Women made food in the courtyard, and the store was just an open kiosk facing the street. They used stones to build houses.
Janaan has no forests, so timber is very expensive.
The people of Greenland smoked little. According to the Saga of Erik the Red, Erik was exiled from Iceland for murder. He sailed west and discovered land, which he named Greenland.
But no matter whether he has found it or not, the people in Auschwitz were living there at that time.
Although all belong to the "Nordic countries", there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure," you may think that the back of the "Declaration of Independence" will paint a treasure map.
However, this is not the case. Although the back of the document wrote something, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the "Declaration of Independence" reads the words "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776 (Original Declaration of Independence, 1776 July 4)". The words are written at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one can determine who the author is, this large-scale sheep skin document (size 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) is said to have been rolled up and stored when it was written.
Therefore, it is likely that this symbol is only added as a label.
Normandy landed and then fought to liberate northern France, but the south was still not liberated.
It was dominated by the "Vichy" French. These Frenchmen reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940 and did not resist the invaders, but cooperated with them.
On August 15, 1940, the German army entered the south of France. This attack was called the "Dragon Rider Operation".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and moved on to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by the people (social group) who live together and work together.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis" (meaning "citizen"), which is related to the Latin words "civis" (meaning "citizen") and "civitas" (meaning "city" or "city-state"), which in some way defines the size of society.
The city is the cradle of the nation. A civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the preservation of cultural relics, and the fair transmission of culture.
Minority cultures often leave no relevant historical evidence, and are not treated as civilized.
During the War of Independence, 13 states initially formed a weak central government (Congress was its only component) under the "Federal Regulations."
Congress does not have the power to tax, and because it does not have a national administrative or judicial department, Congress can only rely on the state government to implement all laws, but the state government often does not cooperate.
It also does not have the power to overturn state taxes and tariffs.
These provisions must be agreed upon by all states before they can be amended, and the attitude of the states towards the central government is very mild, so that their state representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are the second most successful teams in the world, winning the World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, handball, cycling, ice hockey, roller derby, and a first-order equation race car.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern region, and Italians will participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games there.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Hokkaido), making Japan the seventh largest island country in the world!
Due to the large number of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to as "the archipelago" from a geological perspective.
The West's understanding of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century. At that time, European sailors passing by named the island "Ilha Formosa", which means beautiful island in Portuguese.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, began to change the food production method of the original inhabitants, and hired Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1912) controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, the Great Qing Empire announced the establishment of a province in Taiwan.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the "Treaty of Shimonoseki", handing over the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main architectural groups, namely, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Windows.
In order to let tourists better understand the original appearance of the architectural complex, most of the buildings around the architectural complex have been rebuilt.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration work has continued until today.
For example, the most common static image format in the world is 35mm format, which was the dominant film size at the end of the film era.
It is still in production today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual size of the 35mm format is 36mm wide, 24mm high, which is a bit confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS series) have the same or similar aspect ratios.
Frequently abused and ridiculed, the three-point method is a simple guidance method when creating dynamic images, and can also keep the image orderly.
It points out that the most effective position for the subject is the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines dividing the image into three parts (see example).
During this period in European history, the powerful Catholic Church was closely monitored.
Although the languages and customs of European countries are different, Christianity has linked them together for more than a thousand years.
It affects everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate pain and poverty, and the church's money fund is specially set up for this purpose.
The centralization of power in the Church has existed in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they abide by this principle.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to impose a naval blockade on Germany.
They cut off the military and civilian supplies of life and death. The facts prove that this strategy is effective, although such a blockade violates the international law that has been generally accepted by the international community in the past two centuries, according to a number of international agreements.
British warships have been stationed in the international waters of the Gulf of Gibraltar to prevent any ships from entering the waters, including Chinese vessels.
Because the response to this strategy is limited, Germany hopes that its unlimited submarine war can also have a similar response.
In the 1920s, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was peaceful and separatist.
After witnessing the devastation of the First World War, all countries want to avoid repeating it.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job at the Edison Company in New York.
When he arrived in the United States, he carried $4, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation written by his former manager, Charles Batchelor, to Thomas Edison.
Different periods of ancient China have their own characteristics; every period or every ruling family in China is a distinctive dynasty.
In the same way, the era of successive dynasties is also an unstable period of small countries. Among them, the most famous is the 60-year Three Kingdoms period, which is between the two generations of Han and Jin.
During these turbulent times, all the feudal lords fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in China's ancient history. Thousands of people died fighting for the highest power in the luxurious palaces in Xi'an.
There are also many social and political impacts, such as the use of measurement units, the transition from monopoly to democracy, nationalism, and the belief that the country does not belong to a single ruler, but to the people.
In addition, after the revolution, the official position is open to all men, which makes the most burdened and successful people have the opportunity to fly.
Moreover, the military has also adjusted its enlistment criteria. Instead of basing enlistment on one’s academic grades, which used to be the case, now it is based on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond the life of this world. He often went to a cave called "Khir" on "Noor" (Light) Mountain to meditate.
The cave itself not only survived the test of time, but also brought a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual intention.
The cave is located on a mountain in the north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even if you know its existence, it is difficult to find. Once you enter the cave, you are completely isolated from the world.
In addition to the clean and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, there is nothing to see. In the cave, almost nothing can be seen or heard from the outside world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that is still standing.
The Great Pyramid is a masterpiece built by the Egyptians in the 3rd millennium BC. It is one of the many large gold pyramids built in honor of the late pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau in Egypt's Valley of the Dead (Giza) includes several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small mounds, several temples, and a large statue of a lion.
The Great Pyramid was built to commemorate Mr. Ho, and a number of smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to commemorate his wife and family members.
The "up arrow" symbol is like the letter V, and the "down arrow" symbol is like a nail or a missing square at the bottom.
The upward direction refers to starting from the top of the bow, and the downward direction refers to starting from the root of the bow (that is, the place where the bow is held).
The sound of the vibrato is usually softer when going up and stronger when going down.
Please use a pencil to make your own marks, but remember that the symbols printed are musical notes, so they are usually respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, his wife Marie-Antoinette, and their two children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) were brought back to Paris by a group of market women from Versailles.
They took a carriage back to Paris, and a group of people surrounded them, shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The rebels forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage completely.
With a face full of bruises, a rioter once shook the head of a Royal Guard, who was killed at the Faulks Castle.
The war expenditure of American imperialism in the war against the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial government, which accounted for most of their salaries, as well as the interest on the bonds issued by the Philippine government in the name of the Wall Street Bank.
Of course, the long-term erosion of the people of the Philippines has become the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre, it is necessary to understand the background of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre.
The time of the event is usually called the Middle Ages in European history, that is, the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Middle Ages were divided into three periods: the Early Middle Ages, the High Middle Ages, and the Late Middle Ages. The Late Middle Ages ended about 1500 years ago.
The concept of technological determinism is a term that encompasses many ideas in practice, including technological promotion, technological necessity, and a strict definition - human destiny is driven by the logic behind scientific laws and their performance in technology.
Most of the explanations of the technological determinism include these two general ideas: one is that the development of technology has largely transcended the influence of culture or politics, and the other is that technology will have an inherent "impact" on society that is not constrained by social conditions.
For example, someone may say that cars will inevitably promote road development.
However, it is not economically feasible to set up a national highway network for only a few cars. Therefore, new production methods should be developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Higher levels of car ownership will lead to a higher rate of road traffic accidents, which will drive the invention of new medical technologies to repair the injured.
Romanticism has a strong cultural determination of color. This is due to poets such as Goethe, Fichte and Schelling.
Under the background of romanticism, geography shaped the individual. With the advance of time, customs and cultures related to geography appeared. These customs and cultures were in harmony with the place and the society, so they were better than any law.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Tintagel is considered to be the fashion capital of the Middle Ages in Europe.
Its reputation as a luxury goods center began around 400 years ago and continued until about 1100 years ago.
Its position declined in the 12th century, mainly because the gifts brought back by the Crusaders, such as silk and perfume, were more valuable than the goods provided by the bazaar.
It was at this time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Vienna to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak from the 10th to the 14th century.
At the beginning, the costume was deeply influenced by the court culture of the East.
However, due to the slow pace of cultural exchanges, Western fashion may lag behind 25 to 30 years.
As the Middle Ages came to an end, Western Europeans gradually developed their own style. One of the biggest progress at that time was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes after the Crusades.
The purpose of giving agriculture is to carry out agricultural activities that can only meet the food needs of farmers and their families.
Giving agriculture to farmers is a simple and usually organic system that uses local seeds preserved in the ecosystem to combine with crop rotation or other relatively simple technology to maximize yield.
From the historical point of view, most farmers were engaged in self-sufficient agricultural production. Today, in many developing countries, the situation is still the same.
Yue culture brings together like-minded people, and these people feel that they are neglected by society. Yue culture cultivates a sense of identity among them.
Taking into account the age, race, class, position and / or gender differences of members, Asian culture may have its own characteristics.
It may be the combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography or a variety of factors that makes Chinese culture different from other cultures.
Members of the Asian culture group often use unique lifestyle styles to symbolize their membership, including fashion, slang and black language.
To emphasize the importance of socialization, one of the most common methods is to use the cases of unfortunate children. These children have not been able to achieve socialization due to neglect, mistreatment, or deliberate abuse as they grew up without the help of adults.
These children are known as "street children," meaning street children. Some street children are abandoned by people (usually their parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because their parents refuse to accept that the child has intellectual disability or serious physical defects.
Before being abandoned or running away from home, the child may have experienced serious child abuse or injury.
It is said that others are raised by animals; some people live alone in the wild.
If the wolf cub is completely raised by a non-human animal, its behavior (within the scope allowed by its physical condition) will be very similar to that of the animal, such as being afraid of humans or being cold.
Although the project learning method should make learning easier and more interesting, the supported learning method is even further.
Supported teaching is not a learning method, but a means for beginners to use new computer programs or start new projects.
Supported teaching can be carried out online or offline. In other words, the teacher is a form of supported teaching, like the backward arrow helper in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support for internalization is used in software to question, prompt and explain those procedures that may be difficult for students to handle alone.
The children were abandoned for various reasons, including being ignored, abused, or even kidnapped.
No child should grow up in an environment without education, love and care, but the reality is different.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, caring foster parents, stable education and reliable medical care.
The foster care system should provide all the necessities that the original family lacks.
The Internet combines the elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet have added an additional dimension to its use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "interaction" are considered to be important motives for using the Internet (Zhang et al., 1995).
When studying the audience's response to the website, Amy and McDonald (1998) also used "personal participation" and "continuous relationship" as new motivational factors.
The use of recordings has brought about a major discovery in explaining micro-expressions (facial movements lasting a few milliseconds).
Specifically, it is said that one can judge whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out that people who are unable to understand language due to brain damage are still able to accurately judge whether the speaker is sincere.
He even proposed that the ability to understand human behavior may be common to animals such as dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that genetic variation has two sources: visible and invisible.
The mutation will add new genetic variations, while the selection will remove the variations from the gene pool.
Due to the separation and reorganization, the change comes back and forth between the two pools in every generation.
In tropical grasslands, long-legged animals have a similar digestive system to humans. Existing plant resources are difficult to meet the needs of long-legged animals for amino acids.
In addition, if this is not done, there will be serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily obtainable plant-based resources are likely to be leaf proteins and legume proteins, but it's hard for us to digest these proteins unless they're cooked.
Compared with it, animal food (ants, white ants, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also can provide a large amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
In summary, if our ancestors' way of solving the "protein problem" is the same as that used by black macaques in today's tropical grasslands, we should not be surprised.
Sleep interruption refers to such a process: intentionally waking up during normal sleep and sleeping again in a short time (10-60 minutes).
This is easy to do, using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without being completely woken up.
If you find that you reset the alarm clock when you sleep, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room and force yourself to go to bed to turn off the alarm clock.
Other choices based on biological rhythms include drinking a lot of liquid before going to bed (especially water or tea, which is well known to have a diuretic effect), and forcing yourself to get up and move around.
The degree of calmness in the heart is the opposite of the tension of the body and mind.
The smaller the pressure, the more active the vitality. Everyone can find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach the boundary of awakening, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded through the universal love of Mahayana Buddhism and the many skills of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes the methods of kindness, meditation, and universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy is awakened through posture, breathing exercises, mantra and visualization.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is Tummo. By imaging different deities and purifying energy channels, the practitioner can activate the central channel and reach the state of enlightenment.
Germany was the common enemy of all countries in World War II, which promoted the cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, institutional, procedural and cultural conflicts further divided the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began immediately.
The war continued for 40 years, and the mercenaries fought in many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defense had been breached, and the only hope left was to withdraw and reform the army along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost abandoned overnight and more than 800,000 Soviet troops entered the eastern region of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Treaty of Non-aggression between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
So far, shipping is the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
In the traditional sense, the task of the navy is to ensure that the country maintains the ability to transport personnel and cargo, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to transport its personnel and cargo.
A particularly noteworthy modern example is the Second World War's Battle of the North Atlantic. Americans tried to transport personnel and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, with the U-type submarine as the main force, tried to intercept the transport.
If the EU had failed at that time, Germany would probably have dominated the UK as it did other European countries.
It seems that sheep were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, eat their milk, meat, hair and skin.
Family sheep are usually herded in groups on the mountain or other pastures. They are usually managed by shepherds (mostly children or adolescents), who are similar to sheep herders. These herding methods are still in use today.
Britain built the first railway in the 16th century.
Although the railroad car was made of parallel wooden boards at that time, it could make the horse run faster and pull more.
The railway sleeper was introduced at an early stage to fix the rails. However, people gradually realized that if rails were laid on the sleepers, the rails would be more stable and effective.
This has become a common practice, but the iron plate will make the wooden wheel of the carriage more serious.
In the end, the paddle steamer was replaced by the iron steamer. In 1767, the first all-iron railway appeared.
The first known mode of transportation is walking. About 2 million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man), humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors, the southern gorillas, did not have the habit of walking straight.
The people found the phenomenon of bipedal specialization in the southern ape fossils between 4.2 million and 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally friendly lives, join the environmental protection movement, and even become environmental protection activists to reduce disasters to a certain extent in the future.
In many cases, this is very similar to the treatment of symptoms. But if we only want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problem and completely eliminate it.
It is obvious that due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, the world has undergone great changes, and the problem of overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of mankind has become more serious.
The handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4 and sent to the John Dunlap printing shop in Philadelphia for printing.
He printed 150 to 200 copies in one night, which is now known as the "Dunlap broadsides" version.
On July 8, John Nixon read the document for the first time in the House of Commons.
One of them was delivered to George Washington on July 6, and Washington read it to his army in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
Of the 25 surviving Dunlap broadsides, this is the earliest known version of the document. The handwritten original has been lost.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and has been living until today, which is what we call "birds".
Many people believe that they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds are still similar to dinosaurs in many ways.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk like a dragon with two legs.
Today, almost all computers in use are based on the processing of binary code information.
Binary numbers can only take two values, 0 or 1, and such numbers are called binary digits, or "bits" in computer terminology.
The toxin in the body may not appear immediately, and the symptoms such as vomiting are very common. Therefore, it cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The strongest indication of drug intake may be the container opened on the spot, which contains drugs or household chemicals.
Check the labels on the drugs for specific emergency rescue instructions.
Entomologists use the word "bug" to formally call this kind of insect.
The term derives from people's familiarity with insects, which are very well adapted to living on humans.
Hunting insects and stink insects are parasitic insects that are adapted to living in the nests or homes of their hosts.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of MS, which has become the main neurological disease of young people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (comprised of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve).
The study found that the number of women with multiple sclerosis (MS) is twice that of men.
A couple may decide not to have children for their own benefit or for the benefit of their children.
These couples may form adoption plans for their children.
In the process of adoption, the biological parents terminated their rights as parents, so another couple could adopt the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works. In fact, this approach can provide guidance for most scientific research.
Experiments are a way to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, but experiments are not the only way. Asking questions and observing can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers were interested in classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
All opinions published by Einstein in all scientific fields (including psychology) were accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West has cut off its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many physiological and behavioral rhythms observed by the researchers are largely determined by endogenous circadian rhythms and their presence.
Periodic pacing is not just a simple response to external periodic signals. Such pacing is recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue to cycle for a period of time even in the absence of external cues.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase is an evidence that DNA is the main sign of inheritance.
He and Cai used bacteria or viruses to inject their own DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one using radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of the bacteria, and the other using radioactive sulfur to label the protein of the bacteria.
Various effects will be produced by the transformation, which depends on the type of the transformation, the importance of the substance affected by the transformation and whether the affected cell is a reproductive cell.
Only the transformation of germ cells will be inherited by the offspring, while the transformation of other cells will lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural scenery tourism attracts tourists who are interested in natural areas. They come to see the natural scenery, including wild animals.
The on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting the park and studying the ecosystem.
For example, in Madagascar, we visited, filmed and learned about the red-haired lemur.
Every morning, people drive out of the small town to work, and the places where they work are the places where they pass by on the road.
In this dynamic traffic jam, everyone is connected to the private car-based transportation system in some way and provides support for it.
Today, science shows that this large-scale carbon economy can no longer support the stable state of the biological circle that has supported human evolution and development for the past 20 million years.
Everyone is a member of society, and everyone uses the transportation system. And almost everyone has complaints about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapse.
Why does the transportation system cause such complaints? Why do they break down every day? Are traffic engineers not qualified? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flow research is the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and their mutual interaction.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of vehicles because it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the driver's behavior is often within a reasonable consistency range; therefore, the traffic flow often has a certain reasonable consistency, which can be roughly expressed by mathematics.
In order to better express the traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful for the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects are the earliest flying animals in the air. Flight ability makes it easier for them to evade predators and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have an advantage, that is, they can fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them more small areas to hide from predators.
Today, the only insect that cannot fold its wings backward is a butterfly and a moth.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but there are many people who hold the opposite opinion; they believe that the solar system revolves around the earth, and the sun is also (even other stars are).
This seems reasonable, because the earth does not feel that it is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest in the world and the largest river in the world. Its water volume is more than 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections as wide as 6 miles.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of the total river flow in the world.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. Its water comes from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of the stone pyramid has continued to the end of the ancient kingdom, the magnificent scale and superb construction technology of the Giza pyramid have never been surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were shocked by the memorials of more than a thousand years of history left by their ancestors.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the least population.
Venice uses Italian in its laws, regulations and official communications.
Italian is also the language used by most people working in the country, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these elements can be found in nature and are relatively easy to use with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that all things are composed of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also proposed a theory that they will change into new substances and form the things we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Carbon, potassium and other elements are metals. Silver and gold are also metals.
It also contains a small amount of non-metal elements (such as carbon).
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atom is so small that it can accommodate billions of atoms at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the question of the pen has become the head of many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status of the pen is becoming lower and lower, and its use is becoming less and less.
People now write information on computer screens and never have to touch a pen.
People can only guess what the keyboard layout will be when the updated product is released.
The working principle of the fission atom bomb is as follows: it needs energy to bring a nucleus and many particles and neutrons together.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Split the atom again and release some energy.
Some atoms contain unstable atomic nuclei, which means they are likely to undergo fission under little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 kilometers on the near side and about 100 kilometers on the far side.
The ground under the dark ground is thin, and the ground under the high ground is thick.
Because the crust is thinner, the near side may have more dark areas, and the molten rock is more likely to rise to the surface.
The core of the incentive content theory is to find factors that make people identify or generate interest.
These theories suggest that as people mature to a certain extent, some needs and desires are internalized.
These theoretical studies explain why some people want to do what they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
The two dominant content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, when managers begin to lead their former colleagues, there are two behaviors. One is that they will try to maintain a "close relationship" with the team members.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, and there are also difficulties in implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, allocating responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
In another extreme case, this person will become a different individual from before, feeling that he/she must change everything the team has done and take credit for the results.
After all, leaders are ultimately responsible for the failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to differences between leaders and other members of the team.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are also subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the contact point for the corresponding offline team.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may arrange meetings at different times in different time zones, and local management may not understand this.
The existence of a "stealth team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" refers to the management team that each member reports to. It sets standards for all members.
Why does an organization take so long to establish a learning organization? One of the goals of organizing learning is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized between the functional departments of an organization, creativity and innovation will occur.
Therefore, in the process of jointly overcoming obstacles, an organization will often bring new innovation processes to meet customer needs.
Before the organization is able to innovate, leaders must create an innovation culture, share knowledge, and conduct organized learning.
The "Angel" (2006) will explain the continuous body plan as a way to help the organization achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical method of cognitive research. Therefore, it reduces the scope of research and makes the research more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior can provide support for scientists' research.
We have known for a long time that different types of brain damage, injury, disease and tumors will affect a person's behavior and cause some cognitive functions to change.
The rise of new technology allows us to see and study the structure and work process of the brain, which has never been seen before.
This provides a lot of information and materials for us to establish a simulation model, which will help us understand the process of brain operation.
Artificial intelligence has a strong sci-fi color, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science, studying the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research on artificial intelligence (AI) involves the development of machines that can automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnosis and customer problems, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial function.
All of these have become independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to problems in real life.
Artificial intelligence systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military affairs. Some home computers and electronic game software applications have built-in artificial intelligence systems.
Field trips are an important part of any teaching activity. Usually, teachers are happy to take students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Virtual reality inspection is a high-tech solution. Students can watch the museum's artificial exhibits in the classroom, visit the aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art.
Sharing the on-site inspection virtually is also a good way to review the trip and share the experience with the next class.
For example, the students of Bennet School in Boulder, Colorado, design a website about their state every year. The website is redesigned every year, but the old version is saved and used as a scrapbook.
Bloggers can also help students improve their writing skills. Although the language and composition used by students at the beginning of the blog are often very awkward, the appearance of readers will usually change this situation.
Students are often the most critical readers, so bloggers began to try to improve their writing level to avoid criticism.
In addition, writing a blog also "forces students to have a deeper understanding of the world." In order to meet the interests of the audience, the students were inspired and became smart and interesting.
Writing a blog is a tool that can stimulate cooperation and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the traditional classroom teaching.
The "appropriate use of blogs" can help students become better at analysis and reflection; by actively responding to online materials, students can find their positions in the context of others' articles and can put forward their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the capital of Canada and is rich in charm and adopts a bilingual system. The highlight is a series of exhibitions showing the art galleries and museums of Canada in the past and present.
Going south is the Niagara Falls, and going north is the Muskoka River (Muskoka) and the natural beauty across the river that has not been developed.
All these have made Alberta a classic model in the eyes of outsiders.
Going north, the number of smokers is less, and some places are deserts without smokers.
A group of startling population data comparisons: The number of non-white Americans living in the United States is more than the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest island, and it is still an independent continent for wild animals.
Most of the small islands are independent countries or belong to France. They are famous for their luxury beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and the doctrine is widespread in Côte d'Ivoire and Mali.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route from Europe to India.
It is located in the northwestern part of the North American Plate and the southwestern part of the Eurasian Plate.
Women: Regardless of the actual marital status, all women tourists should say they are married.
Wearing a ring will also help (but don't wear too expensive a ring).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to what they consider to be harassment, and that they are often tailgated and groped.
When refusing men, we should be firm and not be afraid to stick to our own position (no matter what the culture is, we must resolutely reject it!).
The modern city of Casablanca was established by the Berber fishermen in the 10th century, and was once used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenid. The port was formerly known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca until the 1755 earthquake, when it was abandoned.
Mogadishu, Somalia will be rebuilt as Daru l-Badya. Spanish merchants established a trading base here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping places in Morocco.
Near the old city of Maidin, stalls selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, and water pipes are everywhere, but these stores are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern edge of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano. The lava of the volcano covered most of the streets in the town, especially in the town center.
Although Gombe is still safe, it is recommended to investigate any place other than Gombe in advance to understand whether the continuous fighting in North Kivu has eased.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking project in Africa.
You can ride a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to visit Goma. The normal (local) price for a short-distance ride is 500 francs.
In addition, because it is relatively distorted, "Tibet" is used to compare the distant foreign country.
Today, although the name of Tianbao has become a tourist destination and there is an airport, it is a poor town.
In 1990, due to the threat of desertification, it was included in the list of endangered world heritage.
This is an important stop in Henry Louis Gates' "African American Lives" special on PBS.
This city stands out from other cities in the country because it is more Arabic than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, providing support for different wild animals.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship attraction of the South African National Parks (SANParks) system.
Like all national parks in South Africa, the park charges a conservation fee and an entrance fee every day.
Buying a wild card (Wild Card) also has a lot of benefits. With this card, you can enter some parks or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the name of the Hong Kong region and is also the focus of many tourists.
The many buildings that make up the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Line are like a shining graph, which is particularly eye-catching against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the beauty of Hong Kong from the best angle, you can leave the island and go to the Kowloon Peninsula on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on the north coast of the island.
This is a place where British settlers dominated, so if you want to find evidence of colonial history, this is a good starting point.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world. The forest stretches 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to the inland of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been announced as a World Heritage by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). This part of the forest in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not only redwood forests, there are also some traces of giant forests. These forests were once full of the Henghe River plain.
The area of Sun Desert is 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is water/swamp area.
Since 1966, Sun Desert has been a wildlife reserve. It is estimated that there are currently 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 muntjac deer in the reserve.
There are buses from the city bus station (across the river) all day, but most of the buses, especially those going to the east and Jaakar / Bumtang, are from 06:30 to 07:30.
Due to the frequent passenger load of the interval bus, it is recommended to buy tickets in advance for a few days.
Most regions can sit on the comfortable and practical Japanese Coaster bus.
If you want to go to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200), sharing a taxi is a convenient and fast way.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a viaduct that crosses the Oyapock River and connects Brazil's Oyapock and French Guyana's St. George.
The two bridge towers are 83 meters high, and the length of the bridge is 378 meters, with two 3.50-meter-wide lanes.
The vertical clearance of the bridge is 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully put into use in September 2017, and the Brazilian customs inspection station is expected to be completed by then.
The Guaraní people (Guaraní) are the most important indigenous group living in the current area of Paraguay. They live a semi-nomadic hunting life and also carry out self-sufficient agricultural activities.
The Chaco region is the home of the Guaycuru and Payagua and other native tribes. They rely on hunting, gathering and fishing for survival.
Barbary in the 16th century was known as the "Indian Province" and was the offspring of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and local native groups.
Spaniards began a three-century colonial period.
Since its establishment in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has been trying to retain the city's many local characteristics and features.
Argentina is famous for its world-class polo team and players.
The biggest tournament of the year is held at the Las Cañitas Polo Club in December.
On other days of the year, you can also see smaller jin markets and competitions.
For more information on the tournament and how to buy tickets, please visit the Argentine Polo Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound, which is equivalent to the British pound.
You can exchange currency at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stani, opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally used everywhere on the island, and credit cards and US dollars are often used in St. Lucia.
In the outer islands, you may not be able to use a credit card, but you can use US dollars; please contact the host in advance to confirm the acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands in the islands, so it must be exchanged before leaving the islands.
Mendez is located in the southern hemisphere, so when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Madagascar is located in the tropical zone; in the summer months, the temperature often exceeds 30°C.
Winter may be colder than you think: the temperature is rarely below zero, but when wind and humidity combine, it will make you feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There is no specific "rainy season" and "dry season" here: the rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wild animals are wild animals, and we should not feed or disturb them.
Park staff said that visitors should keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how warm it is, wild bulls, deer, antelopes, and bears are likely to attack humans.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they cannot maintain the proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the smell, which will attract bears and other wild animals. Therefore, it is necessary to avoid carrying or cooking food with strong smell, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on Upolu Island and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1950s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the scene of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven warships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the bay.
In addition to a British cruiser, the rest of the ships sank. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the fight for independence organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful gathering in the town caused the death of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the Paramount Chief of Samoa.
Oakland is across two ports, so there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The North Shore Beach (in the North Harbour area) stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
There are almost all beaches here, swimming is very safe, and most places have the shade of New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive beach is located on Waitemata Harbour, in the middle of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the east of Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with holiday families, and there are all kinds of shops along the coast. Swimming is very safe.
The local main beer is "No. 1" beer. It has a simple taste, but it is very good to drink and very refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
You can buy a lot of French wine here, but the wine from New Zealand and Australia may have a long way to go.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are still worried, you can easily buy bottled water.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is even more foreign. The small cup of black coffee is "concentrated coffee", the whipped cream of Cappuccino is very high, and the tea is not accompanied by milk.
The hot chocolate reached the standard of Belgium. The price was expensive, but the quality was good.
Many people visit the Great Wall all year round, and accidents rarely happen at the Great Wall due to the above-mentioned activities.

The main breeding ground of the saltwater crocodile is not the ocean, but the river mouth in the north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance can make travelers feel at ease, knowing that there is a place to stay after arriving at the destination.
Although travel agencies may help you book camping and other forms of accommodation, they usually work with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually provide package meals including breakfast, airport pick-up and drop-off, and some even provide flight and hotel accommodation meals.
If you need time to consider whether the price is appropriate, or if you need to go to the destination to obtain other documents (such as a visa), they can reserve a booking for you.
If you need to make any changes or have any requirements, you should first handle it through the travel agent, rather than directly contacting the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants choose to camp on site, and most participants believe that this is an important part of the festival experience.
If you want to watch the performance up close, you need to get there early and stake out a spot near the stage.
Remember, although the music on the main stage may have ended, other parts of the festival may continue to play music until late at night.
Some music festivals set up special camping areas for families with children.
If you cross the North Atlantic in winter, you have to check the position of the cabin, because the noise of the icebreaker will be very terrible for those who are affected the most.
The St. Peter's Boat Tour includes city sightseeing activities. Passengers on the boat can get a visa exemption certificate (for details, please refer to the service terms).
The casino usually tries to make customers spend as much time and money as possible. Casinos usually do not have windows and clocks, and it is difficult to find the exit.
They usually provide special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests happy and make them stay at the casino.
Some sites offer free alcoholic drinks. However, alcohol will weaken people's judgment capabilities. All excellent jockeys know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving or crossing mountain passes in high-altitude areas should consider the possibility of snow, frost or freezing temperatures.
On the snow-covered road, the friction is small, so you can't drive like on a clean asphalt road.
During a snowstorm, the amount of snow that falls in a short period of time can be enough to trap you.
Snowfall, blowing snow, water droplets or frost on the windshield may also block the view.
On the other hand, snowy weather is very common in many countries, and transportation is almost never interrupted throughout the year.
Hunting activities may be the most attractive tourist activities in Africa and the highlights of many tourists.
The word "safari" is commonly used to refer to a journey by land to admire the amazing African wild animals, especially in the tropical grasslands.
Some animals (such as elephants and giraffes) often like to get close to cars, and standard equipment can help people enjoy it better.
Lions, leopards, and chimpanzees are sometimes afraid of people. With binoculars, you can see them more clearly.
Walking travel (also known as "jungle trekking", "long-distance travel" or "long-distance") is mainly walking, usually taking hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, the first time in 1964.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you may encounter difficulties.
The cancellation of various policies is different, but as of the end of March, most of the cancellation policies due to the new coronavirus have not been extended to July 2020 - the original scheduled time for the Olympic Games.
It is estimated that the ticket price of most events will be between 25,000 yen and 130,000 yen. The general ticket price is about 70,000 yen.
