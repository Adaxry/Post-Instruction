This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were brown on top and light or carotinoid-colored on the bottom.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, which is called a rachis, but other features of feathers - barbules - the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suspected that the sample, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the feathers of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult and not chickens.
A car bomb exploded this morning in the police headquarters of the Turkish Gaziantep, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 other people.

In order to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma stream, the luminosity and rotation are taken into account jointly.
The smaller the Rossby number is, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic field reversals.

The scientists came to the conclusion that the dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter is in the form of a halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

Her other race, the giant slalom, she ended with the 10th place in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30. This was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than the ninth-placed Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four cross-country skiers did not finish, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom could not place themselves in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh have found the stolen laptop and mobile phone again.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and secured her phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampra Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police president Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused had appeared before the court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
As a result, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
In the meantime, Adekoya was charged with murdering her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody until the indictment and trial, but witness statements could be distorted because her image was widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in Great Britain, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to cross a dangerous line when they publish photos of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for leading the prosecution, has hinted to journalists that no further comments will be given at least until the trial.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute, in which the Palestinians are demanding a return to the situation before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics that are allegedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only wants a presence for five years.
The guards of the accompanying test should be closely supervised by ringers, since the test was monitored and its effectiveness was assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the managing director of Park Conservation and Heritage in the NPWS, the four selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive security and training training.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Election Commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating have been reported for defective iPods. As a result, six fires were triggered and four people suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that 27 accidents were known in connection with the devices.
“Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as ‘not serious’."
The Ministry reacted by describing the relocation of the report by Apple as "truly regrettable".
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office for Disaster Prevention of the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had also explained that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong as hostages by kidnapping their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six people have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Philippine photographers.
The photographers took the place of an older woman when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in the footsteps of his father and embarked on a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and gynaecologist and took up his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature contractions in his free time.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that investigators from the government recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Ring colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: ""Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died in the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."""
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels gave the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I ... maybe even crazier ... I love her and will miss her ... I hope she is in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the federal elections in 2010, the proportion of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The temporary Prime Minister Julia Gillard explained during the federal election campaign in 2010 that in her opinion Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of respondents said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist at the Olympic Games should swim in the disciplines 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relay teams at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned due to his many complaints.
He was not able to take the medication he needed to overcome his pain, as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of Earth's water supply, together with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Because comets have collided with the Earth in the past, scientists promise insights into how planets, in particular the Earth, are created.
Cuomo (53) took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is speculated that he could run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions every year.
It relies on satellite-based technology instead of the older technology based on ground radar to enable flight controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transport means installed and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking spaces or park-and-ride facilities available locally.
With the concern about insufficient transport possibilities, the probability grew that the game had to be played behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Scientists at Princeton University in the United States and the Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within only two generations, although it was previously assumed that this process would take much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into various forms. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called picture handwriting, in books.
This is called the PH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red coconut oil.
The coal tar changes its color depending on how acidic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and form them with clean, wet hands into a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the external layers, which feels funny and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost every house equipped with a flush toilet that was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Even in ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were toilets. In the Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that men and women visited in mixed company.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and almost immediately reflects it back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It requires a gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to shoot a satellite or a telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service that the bicycle has shown us is very simple and faster transport.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other transport means.
Among them are medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are still many small cats (including free-roaming house cats), which eat far smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has and which ensures that they do not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups, called herds.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to 30 females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other if they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act like wolf or dog packs, animals that behave surprisingly like lions (but not other large cats) and are just as deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not particularly well), swim, jump long distances and pull with the fivefold strength of a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-throated roar of the lion, but more like a series of grunting roars.
Ozelots eat small animals. If they can, they eat monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all of the animals that the ocelot hunts are significantly smaller than it itself.
Scientists think that ocelots follow prey (meat) with their sense of smell and track them down. They sniff around where they have stopped to rest on the ground.
They can see very well in the darkness with night vision and move unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
If a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (e.g. when they move over a mountain range or a river or when they move to a new island and cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so that the new population needs other characteristics or adaptations in order to be a strong competitor as before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
With time, the new population adapts to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen, which people breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce their food through photosynthesis. They also donate shade.
We build our houses from plants and produce clothing from plants. We mainly eat plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so he feared nothing except other Mosasaurus.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, in addition to another set on the gums, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed his path.
We do not know for sure, but he could have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and may even have been a cannibal.
He also grabbed everything that fell into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was not his match.
While most of their food is probably known to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast days, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called a seven-toed mouse.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their meals sitting on chairs. The rich men, on the other hand, preferred joint banquets, where they lay on the side while they ate their meals.
Roman dishes could not contain foods that came from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither maize nor tomatoes nor potatoes nor cocoa, and an old Roman has never cost a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple to each of their gods, which was seen as the house of the god.
Man sacrificed to the gods and the priests tried to correspond to the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar room that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, Zikkurats, were built as part of the temples.
The fabric of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses had little significance.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard. The business consisted simply of open shops on the street. Stone was used for house building.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so that wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. When he continued westward, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But independent of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film "The Legacy of the Templars," you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not the case. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" were written. The text is upside down on the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up at the beginning of his life for storage.
It is also possible that the note was simply added as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles have freed northern France, but the south is still not free.
“He was controlled by the ‘Vichy’ French. These were Frenchmen who had concluded a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them.”
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation troops had freed the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an independent culture that is shared by a significant number of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state and somehow defines the size of a society.
City states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and an appropriate distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the revolutionary battles, the 13 federal states initially formed a weak central government based on the federal treaty, which consisted only of the Congress.
The Congress was not authorized to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national justice, he relied on the authorities of the federal states, which often did not cooperate.
In addition, he had no authority to suspend tax laws and tariffs between federal states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful in the world and was FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Among the popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
“Based on the cluster/group of islands, Japan is often geographically referred to as an ‘archipelago’.”
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European seafarers passed by there and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a branch in southern Taiwan, thereby initiating a change in the rice farming methods of the aborigines and employing Chinese workers on their travel and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of how they originally looked.
Until 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world's most widely used image format is 35 mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, his image format has been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the so-called 35-mm format measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar page ratio.
The much-maligned and often ridiculed thirds rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and at the same time preserves a degree of order in a picture.
It means that the crossing point of the lines that divide a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has held the European states together, despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence dominated everyone, from the king to the simple citizen.
One of the most important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that it is precisely the funds of the churches for this reason.
The central power of the Church has been in Rome for more than 1,000 years. This concentration of power and money caused many to doubt whether this principle was adhered to.
Shortly after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a sea blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, as it prevented the country from vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated the generally recognized international law, which had been codified by several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from advancing into whole seas, which was a danger even for neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted U-boat warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the predominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the experience of horror and atrocities in the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take up a position at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the US with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Old China had a unique method of showing different eras. Each time span in China and each family that was in power was its own dynasty.
Between the individual dynasties there were also unstable periods of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasty.
In these times, bitter wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of old China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a move away from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of class affiliation, the army rank lists are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many suppressed people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Light" (Nur) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the ages and offers a vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, she is not at all easy to find, even if one knows that she exists. As soon as one is in the cave, one is completely isolated.
Man sees nothing but the overlying, clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little can be seen or heard from the inside of the cave.
The Cheopspyramide is the only of the seven world wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaohs.
The Giza plateau or the "Giza necropolis" in Egypt includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small graves, several temples and the large Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheops's wife and family members.
The "Aufstrich" symbol looks like a V and the "Abstrich" symbol like a bracket or a square, where the lower stroke is missing.
Upwards means that you should start at the top and push the bow. Downwards means that you should start at the bottom and pull the bow.
The scraping usually generates a softer sound, while the scraping is stronger and more expressive.
They are happy to add their own pencil markings; but please remember that the printed markings are there for musical reasons, so they should normally be respected.
The panic-stricken King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, her two small children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789 in Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming mob of people who threatened the king and queen.
The mob forced King and Queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At some point, a member of the enraged mob turned the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenses of the US imperialists for the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the expenses, and interest payments on bonds flowed through the Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits, which the continuous exploitation of the Philippine people generated, were the basic profits of US imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the foundation of the order.
The era in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that extends from the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human fate is determined by a logic that is based on scientific laws and manifested in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a course that is largely independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are more inherent than socially determined.
One can, for example, claim that the development of roads is inseparable from the person car.
However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. For this reason, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the health sector for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it was geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with a connection to this geography, as they were in harmony with the place of society.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
His status declined during the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the return of the Crusaders with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offer of Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world was also wandering from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th and 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, the styles in the West lag behind by 25 to 30 years due to the slow communication channels.
At the end of the Middle Ages, West Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothing as a result of the Crusades.
The need economy is agriculture, which aims to produce just as many foodstuffs as are needed to cover the needs of the farmer or farmer and his/her family.
The subsistence economy is a simple, often biological form of agriculture that uses saved, local seed and combines it with alternating field crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers operated a subsistence economy, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring like-minded people together, who feel neglected by societal norms, and enable them to develop an identity.
Subcultures can differentiate themselves with regard to age, ethnic affiliation, class, place of residence and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common methods for illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on a few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized as a result of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
“Such children are called ‘wild’ or ‘wild.’ Some wild children were captured by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child could be attributed to the inability of the parents to accept significant intellectual or physical limitations of the child.”
Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
If it is completely raised by animals, the wild child shows behavioral patterns (within its physical capabilities) that are almost completely in line with those of its specific caregiver, such as his fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, the "scaffolding" goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support for individuals in a new learning situation, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project.
Gerüsts can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the little office clerk in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is integrated into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain working steps that the student alone may not be able to handle.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, and for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the system of care accommodation is a piece of security for these children.
Our care family system is to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable training and reliable health care.
The care station is to cover all needs that were not met in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
„Personal commitment“ and „continuing relationships“ were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the reactions of the public to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important findings for the interpretation of microexpressions, brief facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.x
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who no longer understand a language due to a brain injury can nevertheless correctly assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as house dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation causes new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation.
Outside in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to cover its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences if you do not do it: Growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The easiest accessible plant resources would be the proteins in leaves and pods, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
We should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way as the chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of targeted waking during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can be achieved simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up.
If you are someone who presents the alarm clock in sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another possibility based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid before going to bed (especially water or tea, which is known for its kidney-cleansing effect).
The degree of inner peace a person possesses correlates inversely with the degree of tension in body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive is the available life energy. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is the god yoga. Through the visualization of various gods, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of systems, the course and the culture led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
He should last for the next 40 years and be fought out on battlefields in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed completely and the only hope was a retreat and a new deployment along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became almost obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union penetrated into the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine and created them after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the peace treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method for the transport of large quantities of people and goods over the oceans.
The task of the Navy has always been to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War. The Americans tried to bring crews and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were domesticated in the Zāgros Mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and ethnic groups began to keep them as livestock to get easily to their milk, fur, meat and skin.
House goats were usually kept in herds that wandered around hills or other pastures. They were looked after by goat herdsmen, just like the better-known sheep herdsmen; often it was children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
Already in the 16th century, England built special tracks.
Although the tracks were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Early on, thresholds were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it gradually became clear that rails carrying a band of iron are more efficient.
This was common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of locomotion was walking. Man began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so regularly.
Two-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering.
This is often only a symptomatic treatment. If you do not only want temporary solutions, we should find the root of the problem and treat it.
It is really obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind and that the problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing press of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document took place in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pages that still exist are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived the ages.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive. We call them birds.
Many see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers in use today process information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, for example, vomiting, are so general that one cannot immediately diagnose.
The best sign of poisoning by swallowing is the presence of an open container of medication or poisonous household chemicals.
Look for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison on the label.
The term "worm" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term is derived from the old familiarity with bed bugs. These are insects that are very adaptable in parasitizing humans.
Both rove beetles and bed bugs are nidicolous, i.e. adapted to living in the nest or the accommodation of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most widespread neurological disease among adults of younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over parenthood.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works using the scientific method. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations.
However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by questions and observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were recognized.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior depend to a large extent on the presence of internal cycles and their production by biological clocks.
From a cycle-specific behavior, which is not only a reaction to signals from external cycles, is known for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even execute free-swinging cycles in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key indicators that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects, depending on what type of mutation it is, what significance the relevant piece of genetic material has and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visits to parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is the visit, the photography and the study of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial cities with the car to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is located at the place they just left.
In this dynamic pendulum traffic, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system that is based on the private car and supports it.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.x
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are traffic engineers just incompetent? Or is something fundamentally wrong here?
Traffic flow is the investigation of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, as one cannot predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, car drivers tend to behave somewhat consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain constancy and can be mathematically roughly represented.
In order to better illustrate the traffic flow, the connections between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing and operating facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
As a result, they have a wide range of small hiding places in which they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolves around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, since it does not occur that the earth moves, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes up to six miles wide.
20 percent of the water that flows over the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon mainstream is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes in water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since antiquity, as they can be found in their original form in nature and can be processed with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of the four elements of earth, water, air and fire.
This corresponded more to the four aggregation states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also theorized that they would change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the Periodic Table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe consists entirely of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles, which are called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
According to this, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background by the emergence of new writing methods, so that it has lost its status and its use.
Today, people write messages on computer screens without ever coming into contact with a needle.
One should be curious what will come out of the keyboard when something new arrives.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Something like a heavy truck rolling up a hill. When the core is split again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they already disintegrate at little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made of stone and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called a crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more Maria, since the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during adulthood.
These theories are concerned with what causes certain people to want exactly the things they do and which influences in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of need hierarchy and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behavioral patterns can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
This kind of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary measures, performing performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities and making employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and makes everything his own.
In the end, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to splits between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are led according to the same excellence standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be taken into account by the local leadership.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the leading team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.x
Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can result.
In the end, the collective work of an organization can lead to a new innovative approach to addressing customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation, as well as a culture of shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more effective.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to researching cognition. This narrows the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries such as traumas, injuries and tumors can influence behavior and lead to changes in some brain functions.
New emerging technologies allow us to see and research certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with many information and material to build simulations that help us to understand the processes in our head.
KI is strongly associated with science fiction, but is an important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI includes the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include steering, the setting of strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is today frequently used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering and military and is also integrated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently, a teacher would like to take her pupils to places where a bus ride is not possible.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum exhibits from the classroom, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital of the state. The website is updated every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collection album.
Blogs can also contribute to improving the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
The blogging "forces the students to learn more about the world around them." The need to arouse the interest of the public inspires the students to write intelligently and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become analytical and critical; through the active reaction to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of other authors and present their own perspectives on certain topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is distinguished by a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and in the north the untouched beauty of nature spreads out in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and others make Ontario stand out as what outsiders consider typical Canadian.
Large areas further north are rather thinly populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprised many: More Afro-Americans live in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of the animal world, an independent continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and it was very successful in Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese seafarer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel zone and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual family status.
Even wearing a ring is helpful (only not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as an overreach, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed, etc.
Stay consistent when you reject men, and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences aside; that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The current Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century before the beginning of the era, and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon them after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish merchants who set up trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of tin are sold, but that's only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city, including the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, every stay outside Goma should be carefully planned in order to learn about the ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of Mount Nyiragongo and for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
They can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
This in combination with his relative inaccessibility has "Timbuktu" become a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Although Timbuktu is known as a tourist attraction and has an airport, it is today a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world cultural heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important stations of Louis Gates PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the cities in the country, because it has more of an Arabic than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19.500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which supports a different animal world.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is regarded as the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily protection and admission fees.
It may also be worthwhile to buy a Wild Card, which grants access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a shimmering balsam diagram that is visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best prospects for Hong Kong, you should leave the island and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of the urbanization of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on newly reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists have made their own. If you are looking for traces of the colonial past of the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which a third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and estimates suggest that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses run all day from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leaving between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coasterbuses, which are comfortable and stable.x
Sammeltaxis offer a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby destinations such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapoc in French Guiana.
Their two towers are 83 meters high, their length is 378 meters and they have two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The passage height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction works were completed in August 2011, but the road was only opened for traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs control points will be completed at that time.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited today's eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also the home of other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the great province of West Indies, was created in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquerors with the indigenous Indian groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for its polo team and players belonging to the best in the world.
The largest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be watched at other times of the year.
Information on competitions and sales points for polo tickets can be found at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is fixed in line with the value of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island, which is located opposite the FIC West Store in Stanley.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and on Stanley credit cards. US dollars are often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, but British and US currency can be accepted; check with the owners in advance which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are common.
The winter can be deceptively cool: The temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and moisture make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no pronounced rainy or dry periods: The amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park authority, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
Regardless of how peaceful bison, wapitis, elk, bears and practical all large animals can act, it can happen that they attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild and possibly dangerous, so give them enough space.
In addition, be aware that scents can attract bears and other wildlife. Avoid carrying strongly scented food or cooking strongly scented food, and keep your camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 50s of the 18th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a shameful stalemate of the navy in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the highest chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III III.
Because Auckland stretches over two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the district North Harbour) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most are sandy beaches with safe bathing facilities and most offer shade, which is provided by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes overrun, with a beautiful shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better tolerated.
You can drink the local tap water without hesitation, but if you are concerned, you will also find bottled water easily.
“For Australians, the idea of a flat white is foreign. A small black is an espresso, cappuccino is filled with cream (not with foam) and tea is served without milk.”
The hot chocolate corresponds to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, pay attention to all signs and in particular focus on safety warnings.
Die Würfelquallen treten im Strandbereich und in der Nähe von Flussmündungen nördlich von 1770 von Oktober bis April auf. Sie können gelegentlich auch außerhalb dieser Zeiträume auftreten.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
A booking in advance gives the traveller the certainty that he will have a place to stay after his arrival at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, even though you may also book other accommodation forms, such as camping places, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation for you, if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or inquiries should first be directed to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get up early to get a camping place near the music.
Keep in mind that music is still being played on parts of the festival until late into the night, even though the music has stopped on the main stages.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the breaking of ice can cause quite terrible noise.
Cruises to St. Petersburg also provide time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually try very hard to keep guests on site for as long as possible and to spend as much money as possible. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and ensure that they stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Those who want to drive in high altitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snow-covered roads, the friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be impaired by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari refers in common usage to a land trip to observe the overwhelming African animal world, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and the standard equipment allows a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can observe them better with a telescope.
A foot safari (also "Bushwalk", "Wandersafari" or "Footing") consists of a walk that either lasts a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other places in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Olympic Summer Games after already hosting the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation rules vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation rules were not valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were planned.
It is assumed that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with an average ticket costing about 7,000 yen.
Wet clothing can help drying. Many hotels lend out irons and ironing boards, even if you are not in the room.
If a sewing machine is not available or you do not want to wear knitted socks, you can try to use a Föhn, if one is available.
Pay attention that the material does not get too hot (it can shrink or lead to extreme cases of burning).
There are various methods for cleaning water. Some of them are effective in counteracting certain dangers.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have any doubts, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Insects can destroy food, cause reactions, or even cause allergic reactions, poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are usually not classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from certain taxes and consumption taxes at certain locations.
Travelers whose destination has a high tax rate can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially for products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the highway Buffalo-Pittsburgh is the greatest driving challenge, as it often leads through remote, uncharted terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, you remain vigilant: steep slopes, narrow roads and sharp bends dominate here.
The given speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56 - 64 km / h) - and their strict stoppage is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, the mobile phone coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German biscuits are quite tasty. In Bavaria, they are quite filling and varied, as well as in southern neighbor Austria.

The stirrups are aids for the feet of the riders, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet may get stuck in them.
If a rider falls off his horse and gets his foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged along if the horse passes through. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a flat, fairly narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety buckles that allow a stirrup strap to fall off the saddle as soon as it is pulled back by a falling rider.

The origins of the ski descent as a sport go back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first ski club for leisure time was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski hiking with rucksack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski hiking.
It is similar to alpine touring skiing or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include this, since the latter are executed in steep terrain and require much firmer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions, you can cover larger distances than when walking - only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy rucksack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has numerous independent countries. Normally, you have to apply for multiple visas and go through several passport controls if you want to travel through several countries.
However, the Schengen area functions a little like a country.
As long as one is in this zone, one can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen Member States, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universally accepted definition of which manufactured objects are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define objects over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition points to geographical differences, where the age limit can be lower in regions such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be called "antique" although they are younger than similar products from mass production.
The reindeer breeding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who work in other professions.

Transgender people should not expect that their privacy and dignity remain intact when passing through the scanner.
Rip currents are the returning current of broken waves on the beach, often at reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topography, the backflow concentrates in a few deeper areas and a fast current can form there.
Most deaths occur through exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which is impossible.
If you come out of the current, swimming back is not more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you will not be caught again. Alternatively, you should wait for rescue, depending on your abilities and whether you have been noticed.

The nearby method, to fly in First or Business Class, is to spend a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, to get your own company to pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: As a rough rule, you can assume that you will have to pay up to four times the normal economy tariff for business class and up to 11 times the normal economy tariff for first class!
In general, it is senseless to search for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of pilots who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldavia is Kischinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.

Please treat this place with the respect, honor and respect that it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by placing or scratching graffiti.

Normal announcements are made exclusively in Catalan in the metro, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a number of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
They say to the Parisians that they are egocentric, rude and arrogant.

The rough exterior of the Parisians disappears very quickly when you lay down basic manners.
The National Park Plitwitzer Seen is heavily forested, there are mainly beeches, firs and pines and it offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, various soils and alternating altitudes, it has a remarkable variety of plant communities.
