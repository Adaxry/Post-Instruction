This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot deliver, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were brown on top and yellow-orange on the bottom.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other features of feathers—barbs and barbules—researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suspected that the sample, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the feathers of an adult, not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult and not a chicken.
A car bomb detonated in the police headquarters in the Turkish city of Gaziantep in the morning of the previous day, killing two policemen and wounding more than 20 other people.
According to the governor's office, nineteen of the injured are police officers.
The police said they suspected a militant supporter of Daesh (ISIL) behind the attack.
They discovered that the sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: It was found that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
To determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma stream, the luminosity and rotation are taken into account together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic field reversals.

The work was mostly theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by tides between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also exerts attraction forces on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists came to the conclusion that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter is located in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

In France, voting is a low-tech experience: the voter goes into a booth and sticks a printed sheet of paper, on which the candidate of their choice is listed, into an envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the list of voters.
The French election law is quite strict.
Since 1988, voting booths have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that at the start of the election no envelopes are present and that no envelopes are thrown away, except for those of the properly counted and authorized voters.
The candidates can send representatives who witness every stage of the process. The votes of volunteers are counted under strict supervision and according to special procedures in the evening.

Four skiers of the Krückenskifahren did not finish, and 45 of the total 117 skiers in the giant slalom could not place themselves in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh have found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and secured her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police President Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
As a result, he was transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was charged with murder in the meantime before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody until charges are filed and the case goes to trial, but statements from eyewitnesses could be tainted as her image has been widely disseminated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee says: "Journalists seem to cross a dangerous line when they publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made until charges are brought.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute, in which the Palestinians demand a return to the situation before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics allegedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence of ten years in the Jordan Valley from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority wants only a five-year presence.
The guards of the accompanying trial to contain the plague should be closely supervised by senior officers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness was assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the managing director of Park Conservation and Heritage in the NPWS, the four selected marksmen received comprehensive security and training.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating were reported for defective iPods. A total of six fires were caused by this and four people suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that it had been informed of 34 additional incidents of overheating by Apple, which described them as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the delay of the report by Apple "truly regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office for Civil Protection of the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by kidnapping their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued and there have been at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Philippine photographers.
The photographers took the place of an older lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began studying premature contractions in his free time.
His research showed that the use of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that investigators from the government retrieved two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Ringer colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died in the night of two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels gave the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I ... maybe even crazier ... I love her and will miss her ... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the proportion of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the then Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that in her opinion, Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of those surveyed said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relay teams at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned because of his many complaints.
He was not able to take the medication he needed to overcome his pain, as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for Earth, together with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Since comets collided with Earth long ago, scientists are hoping for insights into how planets, including Earth, came to be.
Cuomo (53) took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political chatter and foolishness."
It is speculated that he could run for President in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions annually.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional transportation set up and the above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking lots or park-and-ride facilities available on site.
With the fear of a lack of transportation, the probability grew that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and the Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species developed within just two generations, although it was previously assumed that this process would take much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into various forms. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be drawn out into a thin wire that can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metal. It can be made so thin that it is used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called miniatures, in books.
This is called the PH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The coal tar changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels funny and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost every house equipped with a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Even in ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were toilets. In the Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women visited in mixed company.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
It requires a gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service the bicycle has provided us is much simpler and faster transport.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them are medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are still many small cats (including free-roaming house cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the niche concept, a special task that every cat has and which ensures that they do not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called prides.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males, up to 30 females and young.
Women normally have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog prides, animals that resemble lions in their behavior and are just as lethal to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not particularly well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar doesn't sound like the lion's full-throated roar, but more like a series of snarled words.
Jaguars eat small animals. If they can, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the jaguar hunts are much smaller than it itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots use their sense of smell to track and hunt prey. They sniff around to find out where they have stopped on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
If a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (e.g. when they move over a mountain range or a river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so that the new population needs other characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor, rather than what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations then look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen that people breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants produce their food through photosynthesis. They also donate shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothing out of plants. We mainly eat plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurus.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, plus another set on the gums, meaning that there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have even been a cannibal.
He attacked everything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was no match for him.
While most of their food would have been known to us, the Romans did have their share of curious or unusual feast days, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a kind of animal called seven sleepers.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their meals sitting on chairs. The rich men, on the other hand, preferred to hold joint banquets, where they reclined on one side while they ate their meals.
Courts in ancient Rome could not contain foods that came from America or Asia to Europe in later centuries.
They had neither corn nor tomatoes nor potatoes nor cocoa, and no old Roman has ever eaten a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
Men brought offerings to the gods and the priests tried to comply with the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, Zikkurats, were constructed as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not as important.
The majority of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard. There were simply shops with open sales counters on the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so that wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. As he continued to travel west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But independent of their discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film "The Templar's Treasure," you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "original Declaration of Independence, dated 4th July 1776." The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
It is not known for certain who wrote it, but it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up at the beginning of its life for storage.
It is possible that the remark was simply added as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent fighting liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
He was dominated by the "Vichy" French. These were Frenchmen who had concluded a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation troops had freed the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also somehow defines the size of a society.
Municipalities are the predecessors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next, a lasting cultural footprint, and appropriate distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states formed a weak central government based on the federal compact, consisting only of the Congress.
Congress was not authorized to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, he relied on the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate.
He did not have the authority to suspend tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian football national team is the second most successful in the world, together with the German football national team, and was FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" geographically.
The beginning of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European seafarers passed by there and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company founded a settlement in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a change in the farming methods of the indigenous people and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, 35 mm is the most widely used format in the world, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its image format has been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
To be precise, the so-called 35 mm format measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The much derided and often mocked thirds rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and at the same time maintains a certain order in a picture.
It states that the intersection point of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together despite different languages and customs.
His power dominated everyone, from the king to the simple citizen.
One of the key Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that is precisely why the Church has money.
The central power of the Church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money caused many to doubt whether this principle was being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a sea blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, as it cut off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade was in violation of international law, which had been codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from advancing in whole ocean sections, which was a danger even for neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the horror and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a position at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Old China had a unique way of showing different eras. Each time period in China and each family that was in power was its own dynasty.
Between the dynasties, there were also periods of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times, bitter wars were waged between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a move away from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of being based on class, the army rankings are now based on the caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the ages and offers a vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if you know that it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
One sees nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Cheopspyramide is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops's wives and family members.
The "Aufstrich" symbol looks like a V and the "Abstrich" symbol like a bracket or a square, with the lower line missing.
Upwards means that you should start at the top and push the bow. Downwards means that you should start at the bottom and pull the bow.
Strumming typically generates a softer sound, while plucking is stronger and more expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; just bear in mind that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie-Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women at Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming mob of people shouting threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced King and Queen to open their carriage windows widely.
At some point, a member of the angry mob swung the head of a guard killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the expenses, and the interest on bonds flowed through the Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Naturally, the superprofits that resulted from the continuous exploitation of the Philippine people represented the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas in practice, from a technology push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human fate is determined by an underlying logic that is based on scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, technology itself has "effects" on societies that are more inherent than socially determined.
One can claim, for example, that the development of roads is inseparable from the use of passenger cars.
However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. This is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare sector to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawing on writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it was geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography, and these, since they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined during the 12th century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of the world's fashion capital was moving from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind because of the slow communication channels.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Need-based economy is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to cover the farmer's/farmer's family's needs.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological form of farming that uses saved seed from the local ecoregion and combines it with intercropping or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel excluded from society's norms and allow them to develop an identity.
Subcultures can differentiate themselves with regard to age, ethnicity, class, place and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through an unmistakable and symbolic style, including fashion, habits, and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on a couple of unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their childhood due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse.
"Such children are called "wild" or wild. Some wild children were kept captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child can be attributed to the inability of the parents to accept the significant intellectual or physical impairments of the child."
Wolf children may have suffered massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were exposed or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within its physical capabilities) that are almost completely in line with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, "scaffolding" goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support for individuals in a new and innovative learning situation, such as when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but also the little office clerk in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest, and explain the steps that the student may not be able to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving, and education-oriented, but many are.
For us, the system of care is a piece of security for these children.
Our care family system is intended to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable healthcare.
The nursing station is intended to cover all needs that were not met in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the use and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal commitment" and "sustained relationships" as new motivational aspects when they examined audience reactions on websites.
The use of video recordings led to important findings for the interpretation of microexpressions, a few milliseconds of facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who can no longer understand language due to a brain injury can nevertheless correctly assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as house dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation causes new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation.
Out in the savanna, it is hard for a primate with a human-like digestive system to get enough amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences if it is not done: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and pulses, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also deliver large amounts of protein that contain all essential amino acids.
In total, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep deprivation is the process of waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you.
If you are someone who wakes up to the sound of an alarm, you can move it to the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another possibility based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its kidney-stimulating effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to stand up to urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person possesses is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the existing vitality. Every human being has the potential to find absolute calm and happiness.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (awakening energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is the God Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras opened, and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of the systems, the course and the culture led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It should last for the next 40 years and be fought by proxy armies in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already completely collapsed and the only hope was in a withdrawal and a new deployment along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became almost obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union infiltrated the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them, after they had entered the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient method of transporting large numbers of people and goods over the oceans.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods and, at the same time, to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring crews and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have conquered Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as livestock to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat and skin.
House goats were normally kept in herds that wandered over hills or other pasture areas. They were looked after by goatherds, just like the better-known sheep herds; often it was children or adolescents who did the job. These grazing methods are still used today.
Already in the 16th century, England had built up its own infrastructure.
Although the tracks were made of parallel wooden beams, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the rougher streets of the time.
Early on, flanges were introduced to secure the position of the rails. But it gradually became apparent that rails with a band of iron are more efficient.
This was common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo erectus, which means "upright human."
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not stand up so regularly.
Two-footed species have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering.
That is often just a symptomatic treatment. If you don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and treat it.
It is really obvious that the world has changed because of the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and that the problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After its passage by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft was sent to the printer John Dunlap a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript did not survive the ages.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive. We call them birds.
Many see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur.
They have scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers in use today process information in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that one cannot immediately make a diagnosis.
The best sign of poisoning by swallowing is the presence of an open container with medication or poisonous household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term "Wanze" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
The term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adept at parasitizing humans.
Both rove beetles and bed bugs are nidicolous, i.e. adapted to live in their hosts' nests or dwellings.
In the United States, around 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the most widespread neurological disease in adults aged between 15 and 50.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or that of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take on parenthood.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations.
It's not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that is designed to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also driven by asking questions and making observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and, in particular, the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were recognized.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often based to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Specific behaviors determined by a cycle are known for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals perform swinging cycles for a while.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key indicators that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects, depending on what type of mutation it is, what significance the relevant piece of genetic material has, and whether the relevant cells are stem cells.
Only mutations in egg cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is the visit, photography and study of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to go to work and are passed by others whose workplace is at the place they have just left.
In this dynamic pendulum movement, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on the private car and supports it.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has sustained human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems lead to such problems, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult, as it is not possible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, car drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better illustrate the flow of traffic, the connections between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help with planning, designing and operating facilities on the roadway.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a broader selection of small hiding places where they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the solar system's movements.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars) revolved around the Earth.
That makes sense, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows over the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes in water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were thousands of years old at the time.
The Vatican City has around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, as they can be found in their original form in nature and extracted with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponds rather to the four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also put forward the theory that they change into new substances in order to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe consists entirely of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention.
Unfortunately, the pen has been pushed into the background with the advent of new writing methods, so that it has been relegated in its status and its use.
Today, people write messages on computer screens without ever coming close to an interrogator.
One should be excited about what will come out of the keyboard when something new arrives.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Sort of like rolling a heavy car up a hill. If the core is split again, some of this energy will be released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate even with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more Maria, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
These theories deal with what makes certain people want precisely the things they do, and what influences in their environment make them do certain things or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behavior patterns can be observed when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to "stay one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
This kind of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and making employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently from the team that did it before.
In the end, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are led by the same excellence standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the leadership team to which every member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can result.
As a result, the joint work of an organization on overcoming a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that meets customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Thus, they limit the research area and make it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage such as trauma, injuries and tumors can influence behavior and cause changes in some brain functions.
New emerging technologies allow us to see and research certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulations that help us to understand the processes in our head.
KI is often associated with science fiction, but it is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of KI includes the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, setting strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The KI system is today frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has also been integrated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently, a teacher would like to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also contribute to improving students' writing skills. Although pupils often have a messy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, this usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author takes pains to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
The blogging "forces the students to learn more about the world around them." The need to arouse the interest of the public inspires the students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can enable pupils to become more analytical and critical; by actively reacting to internet materials, pupils can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and explain their own perspectives on certain topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's enchanting, bilingual capital and is characterized by a series of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north, the untouched beauty of nature in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more make Ontario stand out as what outsiders consider typical Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprised many: There are more Afro-Americans living in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as far as the animal world is concerned, an entire continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and it was very successful in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel zone and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (just not one that is too expensive).
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider an assault, and that it is not unusual to be followed, groped, or have your arm grabbed.
Stay consistent when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences aside; that doesn't mean it's okay!)
The current Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century, at the beginning of the time reckoning, and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Merinides as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon them after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of other tchotchkes are sold, but that is all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any stay outside Goma should be planned carefully to learn about the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
They can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Together with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic, faraway countries.
Although Timbuktu is known for its reputation as a tourist attraction and has an airport, it is today a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world cultural heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important stations of Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders on Mozambique in the east, on Zimbabwe in the north, and on the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which supports a different animal world.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily protection and entry fees.
It may also be worth buying a Wild Card, which provides access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake for the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus for many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a shimmering bull's-eye diagram, which is visible due to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best prospects for Hong Kong, you should leave the island and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of the urbanization of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on newly reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists have made their own. If you are looking for traces of the colonial past of the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world and stretch over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining stocks of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which a third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and estimates suggest that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer living there.
Buses run all day from the district-spanning bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses are often full between districts, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are covered by small Japanese coaches, which are comfortable and stable.
Sammeltaxis offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapoc in French Guiana.
Their two towers are 83 meters high, their length is 378 meters and they have two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction works were completed in August 2011, but the road was only opened for traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs control points will then be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group to inhabit the eastern part of Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also the home of other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the great province of West Indies, arose in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquerors with the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for its polo team and players, who are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be watched at other times of the year.
Information on competitions and ticket sales for polo matches can be found at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in line with the value of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and with Stanley credit cards. US dollars are also frequently accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the remote islands, although British and US currency is accepted; check with the owners in advance which payment method they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures are usually above 30°C.
Winter can be deceivingly cool: temperatures rarely drop below the freezing point, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no pronounced rainy or dry seasons: The amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park authority, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, wapitis, elk, bears and practically all large animals may seem, it can happen that they attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild and possibly dangerous, so give them enough space.
Be aware that smells can attract bears and other wild animals. Avoid carrying strong-smelling food or cooking it, and keep your camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 50s of the 18th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an ignominious standoff between the Marine in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the killing of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III
Because Auckland stretches over two ports, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most are sandy beaches with safe swimming and most offer shade from Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes overcrowded, with a nice shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be more agreeable.
You can drink the local tap water without worrying, but if you're concerned, bottled water is easily available.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" is foreign. A small black is an "espresso," a cappuccino is filled high with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities and pay attention to all signs and in particular to safety warnings.
Squid are found in coastal areas and near the mouths of rivers from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea, their primary habitat is in the mouths of rivers north of Rockhampton.
A booking in advance gives the traveller the certainty that he will have a place to stay after his arrival at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although they may also book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
You can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain additional documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or inquiries should be addressed to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of festival-goers decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get up early to get a camping place near the music.
Remember that some parts of the festival will still be playing music late into the night, even though the music on the main stages has already stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the breaking of ice can cause quite a scary noise for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg also offer time to explore the city. Passengers on cruises are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make every effort to keep guests on site as long as possible and to let them spend as much money as possible. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have a special selection of food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests happy and ensure they stay.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drunkenness impairs judgement, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Those who want to drive in high altitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice and temperatures below the freezing point.
On icy and snow-covered roads, liability is low and you can't drive as if you were on naked asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be affected by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" in common usage refers to a land trip to observe the overwhelming African animal world, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and the standard equipment enables a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and can be observed better with a telescope.
A foot safari (also known as a "bush walk", "wandering safari" or "footing") consists of a walk that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Olympic Summer Games after hosting the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus did not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were planned.
It is assumed that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with an average ticket costing around 7,000 yen.
Wet clothing can be mended while drying. Many hotels lend out irons and ironing boards, even if you are not in the room.
If a sewing machine is not available or you don't want to wear buttoned socks, you can try to use a fan, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the material (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, to burn).
There are various methods for cleaning water. Some of them prove to be more effective in counteracting certain dangers.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others, it must be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies widely, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers can come across animal pests that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause allergic reactions or even transmit diseases.
Infections as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people are usually not classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the possibility of buying goods that are exempt from certain taxes and consumption taxes in certain places.
Travelers whose destination has a high tax rate can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway is the biggest driving challenge, as it frequently leads through remote, uncharted terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: steep slopes, narrow roads and sharp bends are dominant here.
The stated speed limits are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56 - 64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, the mobile phone coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the line, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite tasty. In Bavaria, they are quite filling and varied, just like in southern neighbor Austria.
Gingerbread is widely available, with apples sold as baked goods throughout the year and plums and pears used in the summer.
Many German biscuits also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small, but rich, baked goods, try making Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on spices and herbs, combined with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a great diversity of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further attributes, it usually refers to the food that originated from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the island group, offers a variety of simply spiced dishes. The Javanese prefer to use peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a range of aromatic spices.
Steigbügel are aids for the feet of the riders, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet can get trapped in them.
If a rider falls from their horse and gets their foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs through. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety buckles that allow the girth to fall from the saddle as soon as it is pulled forward by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill sports like skiing and snowboarding are popular sports where you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and slide down a snow-covered slope.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally also known as "ski bums" who plan their entire holiday around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings with depictions of skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first leisure ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski hiking with a backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski hiking.
It is similar to alpine touring skiing or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include this, as the latter is carried out in steep terrain and requires much firmer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions, you are able to cover slightly greater distances than when walking - but you will only rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing on well-groomed trails without a heavy rucksack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but has numerous independent countries. Normally, one would have to apply for multiple visas and go through several passport checks if one wanted to travel through several countries.
However, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen countries, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no generally accepted definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition points out geographical deviations, where the age limit can be lower in regions such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be described as "vintage" even though they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
The reindeer herding is an important source of income for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
In the past, not all Sámi have bred reindeer on a large scale, but have lived off fishing, hunting and so on. They mainly kept reindeer as pack animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Even if the term "Gypsy" is used primarily by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If a travel warning is issued for the country you are visiting, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
They can also consult the advice of other governments. However, their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with other situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Consultations are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views depicted are often superficial, general and compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere, too simplified.
Weather is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Rain can occur anywhere in the world and there are various types of it, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of storms, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are urgently warned to keep an eye on any kind of weather that affects their area, as this can affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a war zone should receive professional training.
A search on the Internet for "courses on hostile environments" is likely to display the address of a local company.
A course covers all the issues discussed here in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on surviving in the wilderness, but only a few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to display passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents that have been updated with the desired name and gender is different.
The readiness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is also very different.
The searches at security checkpoints have become far more intrusive since 9/11.
Transgender people should not expect that their privacy and dignity will remain intact while passing through the scanner.
Riss currents are the returning flow of waves that have broken on the beach, often on reefs or similar structures.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper areas, and a fast current can form all the way to deep water.
Most deaths occur through exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which can prove impossible.
If you come out of the current, swimming back is not more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won't be spotted again. Alternatively, depending on your abilities and whether you were noticed, you could wait for rescue.
The return shock comes sooner than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who find it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their original culture.
When you return from an international stay, you have adapted to a different culture and have left some of your home culture's behaviors behind.
When you first travelled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travellers had to adapt to a new country.
Perhaps one does not expect that also returning travelers require patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and before the show starts.
One normally hears the sounds of tourists and vendors. The history of sounds and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator for a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the different pyramids being illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have most of the stations. Sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, which is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau here and then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak, Mount Vinson, is 4892 meters high.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside and in clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including cruise ships, and by expeditions that need data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off are study and course offers abroad.
This is very popular with school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participation in an international bridging year program can actually improve your chances of a university education in your home country.
Usually, a study fee is charged for the registration to these educational programs.
Finnland is a great destination for boat tours. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands—in the lakes and in the archipelagoes along the coast.
You don't need a yacht for the archipelago and lakes.
Even if the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually big enough for every yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, and one in six or eighth owns a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several days while returning in the evening and spending the night on the ship.
If you only go ashore during the cruise, you don't need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a scary experience for people of any age and from any background, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
One should not be ashamed of this: This is nothing more than the personal fears and antipathies that very many people have.
Learning more about how planes work and what to expect during a flight can help some people overcome their fear of the unknown or of feeling out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery of things. Time is often a very important factor in company documents, commercial goods or replacement parts for urgent repairs.
Larger companies use their own aircraft on some routes, but on other routes and for smaller companies, difficulties have arisen.
If they sent things by air freight, the unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to speed things up was to send it as unclaimed baggage. The airline's regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The convenient method of flying first or business class is to part with a thick wad of cash for the privilege (or, better still, get your own company to pick up the costs).
That is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times the normal economy fare for first class!
In general, it makes no sense to search for direct flights from A to B even for discounts for business or first class seats.
The airlines know very well that there is a specific core group of pilots who are prepared to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and who demand corresponding prices.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the founding of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between the two parts of the Republic of Moldova could be restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive and bustling business center located on a huge bay surrounded by mountains.
The broad boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are characterized by classic red roofs, the market from the 18th century, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe than the traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
There are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons over some graves in the cemetery.
It's worth taking a stroll through the fascinating village for half an hour.
In the north and close by is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its magnificence in vivid colors.
The Scotturb bus 403 regularly drives over Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima in the north – a place that is world-famous for its apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave and a place that has immense significance for a considerable part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered or worked themselves to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this place with the dignity, respect and reverence it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalise the site by putting graffiti on it or digging it up.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers Catalan, the vast majority understands it, and practically everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Metro announcements are made exclusively in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are reported by an automatic system in a number of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be egoistic, rude and arrogant.
Even if this is often just an inaccurate cliché, it is best to get by in Paris by showing your best side and acting like someone who is "well-brought-up". This will make getting by a lot easier.
The rough exterior of the Parisians disappears very quickly if you lay down basic manners.
The Plitwitzer Seen National Park is heavily forested, with mainly beech, fir and pine trees, and a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, different soils and varying altitudes, it boasts a remarkable diversity of plant communities.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats and aurochs, as well as many species that are generally more common.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach to their knees and also cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries, there are woolen robes for women, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
In the same way, men have to wear trousers that go over their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothing is not washed after every user, so you may not feel comfortable in these trousers. There is a uniform size for all men!
The Mallorcan cuisine, like the cuisine in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in the summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All substantives begin with a capital letter next to the word "you," even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also makes reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because one has to determine whether a doing word or an adjective is used as the main word.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced just as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
You should also pay attention to the fact that r and rr are pronounced differently: caro means "love," while carro means "quarrel."
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
This introductory grammar will therefore help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to understand formulations better.
If you speak a Romance language, it is naturally easier to learn Portuguese.
People who speak some Spanish might jump to the conclusion that Portuguese is so similar that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Modern observatories are no longer in operation and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution was not the problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or university campuses that are easier to access than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of the cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where peach blossoms are the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were only held for the emperor and other members of the imperial family.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove more than one specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden and collect "samples," you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place, where one can easily adapt and buy almost everything after arrival.
Since you are in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (if the sky is clear, it is a rare occurrence).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, castle tours in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also show popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important feast days and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the festival have been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries all over the world.
There is the tradition of spending the Easter night awake in some open place to see the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
Traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with the festivities of the congregations often beginning at midnight, when Christ's resurrection is celebrated.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or being washed ashore.
Due to the large distance from the continent, mammals were not able to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first people set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including sheep, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is hierarchical and formal compared to what Westerners might be used to.
Suits are part of the standard business attire, and colleagues introduce themselves with their surnames or job titles.
The harmony at the workplace is of decisive importance, with the focus rather on the group's performance than on individual achievements.
Employees are often required to obtain the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and it is expected that they will unconditionally follow the instructions of their bosses.
