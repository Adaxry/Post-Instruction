This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers - a theory that has been widely circulated - but also provides details that fossilized feathers usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists said that the hair of this animal is brown at the top and pale or purple at the bottom.
This discovery also helps to understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
The feather of the dinosaur did not develop well - this is called the "feather shaft", but there are other characteristics of feathers, such as feather branches and feather small branches. The evolution of the feather shaft may be later than these other characteristics.
The feather structure indicates that they were not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or display. Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature feathers, not downy feathers.

Edgar Veguilla's hand and wrist were injured, while Kristoffer Schneider needed reconstructive surgery on his face.
The weapon of Uka pointed at the fifth person's head went off course. Schade was in pain, one eye went blind, a piece of skull was missing, and the face was reconstructed using a sheet of tin.
Schneider testified via video link from the USAF base in his native country.
In addition to the game on Wednesday, Carpanedo also participated in two individual competitions of the Jing Championship.
Her first project was obstacle sliding, and she ended the first game with a "not completed" result. The game involved 116 contestants, of which 36 obtained the same score.
Her other race was a major upset, as she placed 10th in the women's 4x400m relay in 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Italian Claudia Ruggeri, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-placed Hungary's Zsuzsanna Jakabos.
Four female skiers in the sitting group failed to complete the race, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom project failed to make the list.
The central police chased the stolen notebook computer and mobile phone.
D K Arya, deputy police chief, said: "We have arrested five people who raped this Swiss woman, and found her mobile phone and notebook computer."

He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Afterwards, Adeyemi was charged with the murder of her son at the Glasgow Sheriff Court.
She was detained, pending trial and sentencing; but any evidence presented by witnesses may be negatively affected, as her image has been widely disseminated.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scotland's judicial system is different, and the court believed that publishing the photo could cause potential harm.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, said: "If the reporter publishes the photo and other information of the suspect, it seems that there is a threat."
The main responsible department of the prosecution, the Royal Commission of Inquiry, told reporters that it would not make further comments before the indictment.

Yesterday, Malta was sworn in as a member of the new Temporary Election Committee (CEP) consisting of 9 members.
This is the fifth time that Martelly has been elected to the CEP in the past four years.
Last month, the Presidential Council recommended that the former CEP step down, which was part of the push for new election measures.
The committee is a response by Martelly to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, due to some elections not being held as planned, these protests have sometimes escalated into violent incidents.
It is reported that about 60 iPods have failed and the machine has been overheated, resulting in 6 fires and 4 people being slightly burned.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs of Japan (METI) said that they have noticed 27 accidents related to this equipment.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economic Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had disclosed 34 other incidents of overheating, although the company said these incidents were "not serious."
The Ministry of Economic Affairs responded that the delay in the release of the report by Apple was "very regretful."
The Mariana Islands experienced an earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. Friday in Guam).
According to the report, the incident did not cause any damage in China.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said it had not found any tsunami sign.
A former Philippine police officer detained a tourist from Hong Kong in the capital, Manila, on suspicion of being a human trafficking victim.

Two photographers then took the place of an old woman who needed to go to the bathroom. Dozsa was hit.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps to become a doctor.
He received obstetrics training and began working at the O'Kane National Maternity Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study early pregnancy in his free time.
His research shows that the use of steroids can accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna (Luna).
Tong Ming said: "Lina is the first queen to be respected. She is my first manager. Lina passed away in the midnight of the second month. Such a midnight is special. She is a strong woman."
Dustin Runnels, writing under the name "Dustin Rhodes," said, "Lana and I are alike in that we're hard to pin down ... she may be harder to pin down ... I love her and I think about her ... I hope she gets to a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people was conducted before the 2010 federal election, and the number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's retirement.
34% of the respondents unanimously said that they hoped that Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom would become the last monarch of Australia.
There is a polarized situation in voting. 29% of the respondents believed that Australia should establish a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed that Australia should never establish a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to compete in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and the three relay races of the British Olympic Association, but his health has been questioned due to his complaints.
He has been unable to use drugs to relieve pain because they are banned from competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
In early February, several people used different hardware and software to verify this discovery, and announced it on Tuesday.
The star may be the source of water and organic matter on Earth. These organic matter can form proteins and maintain the continuity of life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed since the collision of the celestial body with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been governor since the beginning of this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called it "political ruin and foolish behavior."
It is speculated that he will participate in the presidential election in 2016.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said that the new generation of aviation transport systems (NextGen) can shorten flight routes, save millions of tons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology rather than the old ground-based radar technology, enabling air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
Without additional transportation facilities, the subway does not stop at Wembley (Wembley), and there are no parking lots and parking facilities on the ground.
Due to concerns about a lack of transportation, the competition may be forced to close its doors without the support of a team.
On Thursday, a research report published in the journal "Science" said that a new bird species had formed in the Galapagos archipelago.
Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that due to the breeding of the local special Darwin's rhea and the alien giant rhea, this new species has only evolved for two generations, although people think this process needs a longer time.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into fine threads, used for weaving and knitting. It can also be beaten or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin, stuck on other metals, and because it is so thin, it is sometimes used for decoration in books called "colored decoration."
This is known as the pH value of the chemical substance. You can make an indicator solution with red cabbage juice.
The color of the spinach juice will change according to the acidity of the chemical substances.
The pH value is expressed by the number of hydrogen (H) ions in the chemical substance.
Hydrogen is an electron-deficient atom (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Stir the two cereals together, then roll them into a ball with a wet hand.
The water on your hand will react with the outer layer, forming a layer similar to the outer shell, which is very interesting.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost every household with a water well, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
The remains of a sewage system have been found in houses in the Greek island of Crete and the city of Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In the Roman civilization, the toilet was a part of the public bathroom for men and women.
If you call someone far away, you will use a satellite.
Once a satellite in space receives a phone call, it almost immediately reflects it back.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts certain light waves and fields of view.
To put a satellite or telescope into space, you need a rocket more than 100 feet tall.
The ship has changed the world in an incredible way. The ship's greatest contribution to us is to make our transportation more convenient.
With it, we have trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cat species, which eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer.
In the end, many small mammals (including domesticated cats) hunt small prey such as insects, rodents, and birds.
Their secret is the Lijia concept, under which each cat is responsible for a special task to prevent them from competing with other cats.
The lion is the most obvious mammal in the cat family and lives in large groups called lion prides.
The lion pride consists of one to three related adult males and up to 30 females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters in the family, women usually have a close relationship with each other.
The behavior of the lion pride is very similar to that of a wolf or dog pack. The behavior of these animals is startlingly similar to that of lions (but different from that of other large cat species), and it is very lethal for their prey.
The tiger is an all-round athlete. It can climb (although its climbing ability is not very strong), swim, and jump. Its pulling force can reach five times that of a human.
The old tiger and the lion, the pig and the American tiger belong to the same type (the pig belongs to the same type). These four big cats are the only ones that can call.
The roar of the old tiger is not as deep as the roar of the lion, but more like a snarl.
The panda likes to eat small animals. If the conditions allow, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. The prey of the panda is almost smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that the American jaguar follows and hunts the prey by smell and hearing on the ground.
Their night vision is strong, and they can see clearly in the dark. Their actions are also very secretive. The leopard's hunting method is to blend into the surrounding environment and then rush towards the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from their main population (for example, they cross a mountain range and a river, or they reach a new island and are unlikely to return), they usually find that their environment is different from what they are used to.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptability to become a strong competitor rather than what they needed before.
The original population has not changed, and they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
With the passage of time, new populations began to adapt to new environments, and they began to become more and more different from other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, these two species will finally look different, so that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process "speciation" or the formation of new species. Speciation is the inevitable result of evolution and an extremely important circle in evolution.
Plants can produce oxygen that humans inhale and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants absorb nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants, we make our clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The dragon is the top predator in its era, and it is not afraid of anything.
Its long upper lip is covered with more than 70 sharp canine teeth, and there is another row above the lip. This means that anything it encounters has nowhere to hide.
Its jaws may have been sheared off, and we are not certain about this. Its diet includes sea turtles, large fish, and other sharks, and it may even have eaten people.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like Velociraptor are not its opponents.
Although most of the food of the Romans is what we usually eat, they really have some strange or unusual dishes, such as pork, quail, antelope and a kind of mouse called a mouse.
Another difference is that the poor sit at the table to eat, while the rich like to gather together to hold banquets, lying on the side to eat.
Food from America or Asia that has been in Europe for several centuries cannot be found in the diet of the ancient Romans.
For example, they didn't have corn, pumpkins, beans, and chili peppers, and no one in Guatemala had ever eaten turkey.
The Bali people build a temple for each of their gods and regard it as the residence of the gods.
People will offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests will satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has a courtyard that is open to the public and a sanctuary that can only be entered by priests.
Some special-shaped pagodas are called gold-lettered pagodas, which are built as a part of the temple.
The top of the mountain is a special sacred place of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not that important.
Most of the family's life is spent outdoors.
Women cook in the house; the store is just a counter facing the street. They build their houses with stone.
Jinan has no large forests, so wood is very expensive.
The Greenlanders were few in number. According to the Icelandic sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and sailed west to find land. He named it Greenland.
But no matter whether he found it or not, Jesus had already lived there.
Although they all belong to the "Siberian Cossacks," the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland are very different.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure," you may think that the back of the "Declaration of Independence" is a treasure map.
However, that is not the case. Although this document has some writing on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the "Declaration of Independence" is written with the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776 (Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776)." The words are written at the bottom of the document.
Although the author cannot be determined, this large sheep skin document (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) is said to have been rolled up and stored when it was written.
Therefore, it is likely that this symbol is only added as a label.
The landing at Normandy and subsequent fighting liberated northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These French reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940 and did not oppose the occupiers, but cooperated with them.
On August 15, 1940, the League of Nations entered the south of France, and this attack was called the "Dragon Ride Operation."
In just two weeks, the US and French armies had liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a community of living and working together (society).
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis" (meaning "citizen"), which is related to the Latin words "civis" (meaning "citizen") and "civitas" (meaning "city" or "city-state").
The city is the ancestor of the nation. Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the footprint of culture left behind, and the fair transmission of culture.
The cultural heritage of minority ethnic groups often disappears without a trace, and is not recognized as a civilization that is the same as others.
During the War of Independence, 13 states initially formed a weak central government (Congress was its only component) in accordance with the Federal Regulations.
The National Assembly does not have the power to levy taxes, and because there is no national administrative department or judicial department, the National Assembly can only rely on the state government to implement all laws. The state government often does not comply.
It does not have the power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between the states.
These provisions must receive the unanimous consent of all states before they can be amended, and the states have a very slow attitude towards the central government, with their state representatives often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are the second most successful team in the world, winning the World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, oar, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating and formula racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern region, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Okinawa), making it the seventh largest island country in the world!
Because Japan has many islands, Japan is often called the "archipelago" from the geological point of view.
The West's knowledge of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century. At that time, European sailors named the island "Formosa," which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan and began to change the way of food production of the aborigines, and hired Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing army controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan. In 1885, the Qing government announced the establishment of a province in Taiwan.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan and allowing Japan to govern Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the House of Three Windows.
In order to help tourists better understand the original appearance of the building group, most of the buildings on the edge of the building group have been rebuilt.
By 1976, 30 percent of the mural was restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static image photography format in the world is 35mm format, which was the dominant film size in the late period of the film era.
It is still produced, but more importantly, its long-short ratio is applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual size of the 35 mm format is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is somewhat confusing.
Therefore, the width-to-height ratio of this format is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format series) are close to or the same as this ratio.
The three-point rule is often abused and ridiculed, but it is a simple guide when creating dynamic images, and it can also help maintain the order of the image.
It points out that the most effective position for the subject is to divide the image into three parts at the crossing point of the line (see the example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which was already rich and powerful, was closely monitored.
Although the languages and customs of the European countries are different, Christianity has connected them for more than a thousand years.
From the king to the common people, it has a powerful influence on every person.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's currency fund is specifically set up for this purpose.
The centralized authority of the Church has existed in Rome for more than a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money has caused many people to question whether they have followed this doctrine.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began to impose a blockade on Germany.
They cut off military and civilian supplies. The strategy proved to be effective, although it violated the international law universally accepted in the past two centuries in accordance with several international agreements.
The United Kingdom has prevented any ship from entering the entire sea area and even threatened the neutral ships.
Because the response to this strategy is limited, Germany hopes that its unrestricted submarine warfare can also have a similar response.
In the 20th century, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was peaceful and separatist.
After witnessing the atrocities of the First World War, all countries want to avoid repeating the mistake.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job at the Edison Company in New York.
When he arrived in the United States, he had $4 in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from his former boss, Charles Batchelor.
Different periods of ancient China have their own characteristics; each dynasty in each period of China is a distinct feature.
Similarly, the period between the Zhou Dynasty and the Ming Dynasty was a period of instability for small countries. The most famous of these was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period, which was between the two generations of the Han Dynasty.
In these turbulent times, all roads led to the struggle for the throne.
The three countries were one of the bloodiest periods in Chinese history. Thousands of people died for the highest power in the magnificent palaces in Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of measurement units, the change from a special system to a democratic system, nationalism, and the belief that the country is not the only ruler but belongs to the people.
In addition, after the revolution, the official job is open to all male applicants, which gives the most burdened and most successful people the opportunity to fly to the top.
The military is also changing because military ranks are no longer based on rank, but on ability.
The French Revolution also encouraged many other oppressed workers to start their own revolution.
Muhammad is very interested in things outside of his dusty life. He used to go to a cave called "Xila" on the "Nur" (Light) Mountain for meditation.
The hole itself, in addition to withstanding the test of time, also gives a very lively image of Mozart's spiritual intention.
The hole is located on top of a mountain in the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even if it is known to exist, it is difficult to find. Once you enter the tunnel, you are completely isolated from the world.
In addition to the clean and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen. In the cave, almost nothing can be seen and heard from the outside world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that is still standing.
The Great Pyramid is the greatest achievement of the Egyptians in the third millennium BC. It is one of the large pyramids that the Egyptians built to express their respect for the dead.
The Giza Plateau in Egypt, which includes the Great Pyramids, several small pyramids, several temples, and a large statue of a lion, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The Great Pagoda was built to commemorate Hufa, and a number of smaller pagodas, tombs and temples were built to commemorate his wife and family members.
The "upward" symbol is like the letter V, and the "downward" symbol is like a nail or a missing bottom square.
The upward direction is to start from the top, and the downward direction is to start from the bottom (that is, the place where the hand grips the bow).
The upward curve usually produces a more gentle sound, while the downward curve produces a stronger, more determined sound.
Feel free to use a pen to write your own mark, but remember that the sound symbol is meaningful, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (11-year-old Marie-Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), as well as the queen's sister, the Duchess of Angoulême, were smuggled out of Paris by a group of market women.
They took a taxi back to Paris and were surrounded by a group of people shouting threats at the king and queen.
The rioters forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage completely.
With the queen's face, a rioter once shook the head of a royal guard who was killed in the Palace of Versailles.
The war funding of American imperialism when it conquered the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government, which was used to pay most of the expenses, as well as the interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by the Wall Street Bank.
Of course, the high-yield profit gained by the Filipino people for a long time has become the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, you must understand the background that led to the establishment of the Knights Templar.
The era in which the event occurred is usually referred to as the Middle Ages of European history, that is, the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Middle Ages was divided into the Early Middle Ages and the Late Middle Ages. It was generally believed that the Late Middle Ages ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas, including technological promotion, technological necessity, and a strict definition - that human destiny is driven by the logic behind scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most of the explanations of technological decisions include these two general ideas: first, the development of technology itself has largely exceeded the influence of culture or politics, and second, technology will inevitably have an "impact" on society that is not subject to social conditions.
For example, someone may say that cars will inevitably promote the development of roads.
However, for the national road network of a small number of automobile frames, this is not economically feasible. Therefore, a new production method should be adopted to reduce the cost of automobiles.
The higher the level of automobile insurance, the higher the road traffic accident rate will be, which will drive the invention of new medical technology for the repair of injured persons.
Romanticism has a strong cultural determinism. This is due to poets such as Wordsworth, Coleridge and Shelley.
Against the background of wanderlust, geography has shaped individuals. With the passage of time, customs and cultures related to geography have emerged. These customs and cultures, because they are in harmony with the local customs of society, are better than any laws enforced by force.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of fashion in the modern world, Jinshan Ting Castle is considered the capital of fashion in the era of closure in Europe.
Its reputation as a luxury center began around the year 400 and has continued to the year 1100.
Its position declined in the 12th century, mainly because the gifts brought back by the Crusaders, such as silk and incense, were more valuable than the goods sold in the marketplace.
It was at this time that the name of the fashion capital was transferred from Milan to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was deeply influenced by the Confucian culture of the East.
However, due to the slow pace of cultural exchange, Western fashion may lag behind 25 to 30 years.
With the approach of the end of the Middle Ages, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own style. One of the greatest advances at that time was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes after the Crusades.
For agriculture, it is to produce only the food that farmers and their families need.
Agriculture is a simple and generally organic system, using local seeds preserved in the ecological region, combined with the rotation of crops or other simple techniques, to maximize yield.
From history, most farmers have engaged in self-sufficient agricultural production. Today, in many developing countries, the situation is still the same.
Ya culture brings together people who are in harmony with themselves, and these people feel that they are ignored by the standards of society. Ya culture cultivates a sense of identity among them.
In view of the age, race, class, position and / or gender differences of members, the Yue culture may have its own characteristics.
It may be a combination of factors such as language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, and geography.
Members of the Asian Cultural Group often use their unique style of performance to represent their identities, including fashionable clothing, gestures and black speech.
To illustrate the importance of socialization, one of the most common methods is to use the cases of disadvantaged children. These children, because they are ignored, suffer misfortune or are deliberately abused, do not achieve socialization in the process of growing up without the help of adults.
Such a child is called a "wild child," meaning a wild child. Some wild children are hidden by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the parents' refusal to accept their child's serious intellectual or physical defects.
Before being abandoned or leaving home, the child may have suffered severe child abuse or injury.
It is said that others are raised by animals; some people live alone in the wild.
If the wolf cub is completely raised by non-human animals, its behavior (within the limits of physical conditions) will be very similar to that of the animal, such as fearing or being cold to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the structured learning method is further advanced.
Supported teaching is not a learning method, but a means for people to learn how to use new computer programs or start new projects.
Supported teaching can be conducted online or offline. In other words, the teacher is a kind of form of supported teaching, just like the round-shaped pointer assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support for internalization in software is used to question, prompt and explain those procedures that may be difficult for students to handle independently.
The children were sent away for various reasons, including being overlooked, mistreated, and even abused.
No child should grow up in an environment without education, love and care, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable medical care.
The donation system should provide all the necessities that a natural family is lack of.
The Internet combines the elements of mass communication and personal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet add extra dimensions to its use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "interaction" are considered to be important motives for using the Internet (James and others, 1995).
In the study of the response of the public to the website, Ai Weiwei and McDonald (1998) also took "personal participation" and "continuous relationship" as new motivation factors.
The use of the recording to explain micro-expressions (movements of the face for several seconds) has brought major discoveries.
Specifically, it is said that it is possible to judge whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his essay "The President's Speech" that people who cannot understand language due to brain injury can still accurately judge whether the speaker is sincere.
He even suggested that the ability to understand human behavior may be the common property of animals such as dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that genetic variation has two types: visible and invisible.
Transition will add new genetic variations, while selection will remove variations from the gene pool.
Due to the separation and reorganization, the variation between the two generations has changed.
On the tropical grasslands, the long-necked animals have a similar digestive system to that of humans. The existing plant resources are difficult to meet the needs of long-necked animals for amino acids.
In addition, if this is not done, there will be serious consequences: growth suppression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily obtained plant protein resources should be the proteins in the leaves and beans, but as we are long-necked animals, it is difficult for us to digest these proteins, unless they are cooked.
Compared with that, animal food (ants, white ants, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides a large amount of protein, which contains all the necessary amino acids.
Overall, if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in the same way as the method used by the black monkey on the hot savanna today, we should not be surprised.
Sleep interruption refers to the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep again within 10-60 minutes.
This is easy to do, using a quiet alarm clock to let you wake up without being fully awake.
If you find that you will reset the alarm clock when you are sleeping, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room and force yourself to go to bed.
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking a lot of liquid before bed (especially water or tea, which is well known to have a diuretic effect) to get up more easily.
The degree of inner calm and the tension of the body and spirit are opposite.
The smaller the pressure, the more active the life force will be. Everyone can find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach the boundary of opening up, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded through the universal love of Buddhism and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes the methods of Kundalini yoga, meditation and universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (Kundalini awakening) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visual images.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is to imagine different deities and purify the energy channels, activate the meridians, and reach the boundary of enlightenment.
Germany was the common enemy of all countries in the Second World War, which promoted cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, conflicts in the system, procedures and culture once again drove the two countries apart.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies have become enemies, and the cold war has begun.
The war has continued for 40 years, and proxy armies have fought on many battlefields in Africa and Asia, including Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense line had been breached, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize the troops along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost abandoned overnight. After violating the "Riga Peace Treaty," the "Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty," and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, and invading the eastern region of Poland, more than 800,000 Soviet troops entered the country and set up camps in Belarus and Ukraine.
So far, shipping is the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
From the traditional meaning, the mission of the navy is to ensure the ability of the country to transport personnel and goods, and at the same time, to interfere with the ability of the enemy to transport its personnel and goods.
One of the most noteworthy modern examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. Americans tried to cross the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, with U-type submarines as the main force, tried to intercept the transport.
If the alliance failed at that time, Germany was likely to deceive other European countries as it deceived Britain.
It seems that the mountain sheep was first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them and use their milk, meat, hair, and skin.
House sheep are usually kept in flocks on the mountain or other pastures, and are usually managed by shepherds (mostly children or teenagers), who are similar to the more widely known shepherds. These grazing methods are still used today.
The United Kingdom has built a cargo road since the 16th century.
Although the Malawi railcar is only made of parallel wooden planks, at that time, these cars can make the locomotive run faster and pull more.
Early on, they introduced the railroad tie, which was used to fix the iron rail. However, people gradually realized that if iron plates were placed on the iron rail, the iron rail would be more stable and effective.
This has become a general practice, but the iron plate will make the wooden carriage wheel wear more seriously.
Finally, the steamboat was replaced by the iron boat. In 1767, the first all-iron rail was put into use.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo erectus, humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors did not have the habit of standing upright.
People have found the phenomenon of double-feet specialization in the south African fossil of 42 million to 39 million years ago. Although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start to live in a more environmentally friendly way, join the environmental protection movement, and even become an environmental protection activist to reduce the disasters to a certain extent in the future.
In many cases, this is similar to the treatment of the disease. However, if we only want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it completely.
Obviously, due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, the world has undergone great changes, and the problem of overpopulation and human luxury has become more serious.
The handwritten draft, signed by the president, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4 and sent to John Dunlap, a printer in Philadelphia, for printing.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were printed, which is now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
On July 8, John Nixon first publicly read the document in the independent hall.
One letter, dated July 6, was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on Aug. 10.
The 25 surviving copies of the broadsides are the earliest known versions of the document. The original manuscript was not preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and have lived until today, which is what we call "birds."
Many people think they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
They have scales on their feet and claws, and will lay eggs. They also walk with their hind legs like a dragon.
Today, almost all the computers used for investment are based on the processing of binary code information.
A binary digit can only take one of two values, 0 or 1, and such a digit is called a binary digit, or a "bit" in computer jargon.
Drugs in the body may not immediately show up, and vomiting and other symptoms are very common, so it is not possible to make a diagnosis immediately.
The most powerful indicator of drug intake may be the container opened on the spot, which contains drugs or household chemicals.
Check the label on the drug for specific emergency instructions.
Entomologists use the word "bug" to officially call this kind of insect.
The term comes from people's familiarity with flies, which are insects that are well adapted to living with humans.
Both the hedgehog and the cockroach are hibernating insects that are adapted to living in the nest or house of the host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which has become the main neurological disease of young people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve).
The study found that the prevalence of multiple sclerosis in women is twice that of men.
A couple may decide not to have children for their own benefit or for the benefit of their children.
These couples may form a custody plan for their children.
During the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their rights as parents, so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to find the operating mode of the world through scientific methods. In fact, this method can provide guidance for most scientific research.
Experiments are used to eliminate one or more possible assumptions, but experiments are not the only method. Questions and observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers were interested in the classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
All his views on all scientific fields (including psychology) have been accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West has cut off its roots in Greek philosophy and science.
The researchers observed that many physiological and behavioral rhythms are largely determined by the endogenous circadian rhythm and its existence.
Periodic breathing is not only a simple response to external periodic signals. This kind of breathing has been recorded in most animals, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clock is a self-maintained oscillator that will continue to oscillate for a while even in the absence of external prompts.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase shows that DNA is one of the main evidences of the inheritance of genetic material.
He and Cai used bacteria or viruses to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments. In one, they used radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of the bacteria. In the other, they used radioactive sulfur to label the proteins of the bacteria.
The impact of the mutation will vary depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the inherited material affected, and whether the affected cell is a reproductive cell.
Only the mutation of the stem cell will be inherited by the child, while the mutation of other cells will lead to cell death or cancer.
The natural scenery tourism industry attracts tourists who are interested in natural areas. They come to watch the natural scenery, including wild plants.
The on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting the park and studying the ecological system.
For example, they visited, filmed and learned about the red monkey in Palawan.
Every morning, people drive out of the small town to work, and the workplace of the people they pass by on the road is the place where they leave.
In this dynamic traffic environment, everyone is connected to the private car-based traffic system in some way, and provides support for it.
Today, science shows that this large-scale carbon economy cannot support the stable state of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone is a member of society and will use the transportation system. And almost everyone has complaints about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapse.
Why does the transport system cause such complaints? Why do they break down every day? Are the traffic engineers not qualified? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flow research is the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because it is difficult to predict the behavior of drivers with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, the driver's behavior is usually within a reasonable range of consistency; therefore, traffic flow is often consistent and can be generally expressed by mathematics.
In order to better express the traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful to the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects are the earliest animals to fly in the air. Their flying ability makes them easier to evade enemies and more effective in finding food and mates.
Most insects have an advantage that their wings can be folded along their bodies.
This gives them more space to hide from predators.
Today, the only insect that cannot fold its wings is the cockroach and the beetle.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but there are also many people who hold the opposite view; they think that the solar system revolves around the earth, the sun is (and even other stars are) .
This seems reasonable, because the earth does not feel that it is moving, is it not?
The Amazon River is the second longest in the world and the largest river in the world. Its water volume is more than 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections as wide as 6 miles.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of the world's river flow.
The Yangtze River mainstream is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The river water comes from thousands of small tributaries.
Although the construction of the Stone Pagoda has continued until the late period of the Western Wei Dynasty, the magnificent scale and high-tech construction of the Jisha Pagoda have never been surpassed.
The Egyptians of the New Kingdom period lamented the memory of their ancestors of more than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the least population.
Ventimiglia uses Italian in legal documents and official communications.
Italian is also the language most commonly used by people working in the country, while Latin is used for religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these elements can be found in nature and are easy to extract using primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle proposed that everything is composed of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (solid, liquid, gas, and plasma), but he also proposed a theory that they will change into new materials and constitute the things we see.
The alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Magnesium and aluminum are metals, and silver and gold are also metals.
There are also some alloyed with a small amount of non-metal elements (such as carbon).
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atom is so small that the phrase at the end of this sentence can accommodate billions of atoms.
Therefore, the question of the pen has become the head of many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the position of the pen is lower and lower, and the use is less and less.
People are now writing information on the computer screen, without ever touching a pen.
People can only guess what will happen when the new product is released.
The working principle of the atomic bomb is as follows: to bring together a nucleus and many quarks and gluons requires energy.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy toy car up a hill. You split the atom and then release some energy.
Some atoms contain unstable atomic nuclei, which means they are likely to split under little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 kilometers near the surface and about 100 kilometers far from the surface.
The underground is thin and the underground is thick.
Because the crust is thinner, there may be more dark areas on one side, and magma is more likely to rise to the surface.
The core of the content theory is to find factors that cause people to recognize or generate interest.
These theories show that when people reach a certain level of maturity, some needs and / or desires are internalized.
These theoretical studies are why some people want to do what they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Heisenberg's two-factor theory.
In general, when managers start to lead their former colleagues, there are two behaviors. One situation is that they will try to maintain a "close relationship" with team members.
It is difficult for managers of this type to make unpopular decisions, and they also find it difficult to implement legal measures, assess performance, allocate responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
In another extreme case, this person will become a radically different individual, feeling that he/she must change everything the team does and take credit for the results.
After all, the leader bears ultimate responsibility for the failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to differences between leaders and other members of the team.
The virtual team needs to adhere to the same quality standards as the traditional team, but there are also subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the contact point for the corresponding offline team.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may be arranged for different time zones, and local management may not understand this.
The true existence of the "stealth team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of the virtual team.
The "invisible team" refers to the management team that each member reports to. It sets standards for all members.
Why does an organization spend so much time to establish a learning organization? One of the goals of organizing learning is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized among the functional departments of an organization, creativity and innovation will occur.
Therefore, in the process of working together to overcome the obstacles, a group of organizations will often lead to new innovation processes to meet the needs of customers.
Before organizations can innovate, leaders must create an innovation culture, share knowledge, and learn in an organized way.
The "Angel" (2006) will continue to interpret the systematic plan as a method to help the organization achieve a higher level of performance.
Neuroscience data provide a theoretical basis for cognitive research. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain disease and behavior can provide support for scientists' research.
We knew early on that different types of brain injury, trauma, disease and tumors can affect human behavior and cause changes in certain cognitive functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to see and study the structure and working process of the brain, which has never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to help us understand the process of brain operation.
Artificial intelligence has a strong sci-fi color, but it is actually an important branch of computer science, studying the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The study of artificial intelligence (AI) involves the automatic task of manufacturing intelligent machines.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnosis and customer problems, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face functions.
All of these have become independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to the problems of real life.
Artificial intelligence systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military. Some home computers and electronic games have embedded artificial intelligence systems.
Field trips are an important part of any educational activity. Usually, teachers are happy to take students to places that the bus cannot reach.
Virtual reality inspection is a high-tech solution. Students can watch the museum's artificial exhibits in the classroom, visit the aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art.
Sharing the on-site observation virtually is also a good way to review the itinerary and share the experience with the next class.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their state government every year. The site is redesigned annually, but the old version is saved online and used as a cutting board.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often use simple language and writing when they start blogging, the presence of readers often changes this situation.
Students are often the most challenging readers, so bloggers began to strive to improve their writing level and avoid criticism.
In addition, writing a blog also "forces students to have a deeper understanding of the world." In order to meet the interests of the audience, the students are encouraged to be smart and interesting.
Writing a blog is a tool that can stimulate cooperation and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the traditional classroom.
Proper use of blogs can make students better at analysis and deduction; by actively responding to online materials, students can find their own positions in the context of others' articles and can put forward their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, the capital of Canada, is a charming city that uses the bilingual system. The highlight is a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Going south is Niagara Falls, and going north is the unspoiled natural scenery of Muskoka and the river.
All of these have made the province a typical Canadian model for foreigners.
People in the vast grassland areas of northern Inner Mongolia smoke less, and some areas are deserted.
A startling comparison of population data: The number of non-white Americans living in the United States is higher than the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.

It connects with the Sahel region in the north and the south and west of the continent.
Women: It is recommended that all female tourists say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing gloves can also help (but don't wear expensive gloves).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to their being sexually harassed; and that they are often groped and fondled.
When refusing a man, it is necessary to be firm and not afraid to insist on one's own position (no matter what the culture is, it must be resolute!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by the Berber fishermen in the 10th century. It was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merenid.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it, renaming it Casa Branca until an earthquake in 1755 caused them to abandon it.
Mogadishu will be rebuilt as Daru l-Badya. Spanish merchants have established a trading base here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping places in all of Colombia.
Near the old city of Mazatlan, shops selling traditional Mazatlan products such as tiles, pottery, dolls, and water pipes can be found everywhere, but these shops are targeted at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located at the eastern end of Congo, near Lubumbashi.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano. The lava buried most of the streets in the town, especially the town center.
Although Goma is safe, any place other than Goma should be investigated in advance to understand whether the ongoing combat in North Kivu has eased or not.
The city is also the base for tracking the cheapest mountain gorillas in Africa, including the Nyiragongo volcano.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to visit Goma. The normal (local) price of a short trip is 500 Congolese francs.
Because of the relative extremism, "Tibetan Map" is used to describe the distant foreign country.
Today, although the name of Tongbao Town has become a tourist destination, and there is an airport, but this is a poor town.

Compared with other cities in the country, this city is more Arabic style than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, east of Mozambique, north of Tanzania, and south of the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers, divided into 14 different ecological areas, providing support for different wild plants.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship attraction of the South African National Parks (SANParks) system.
Like all South African national parks, the park charges a maintenance fee and an entrance fee every day.
Buying a Wild Card has many benefits. With this card, you can enter some parks in South Africa or all national parks in the country.
Hong Kong Island is the name of the Hong Kong region and the focus of many tourists.
The many buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline are like a shimmering mosaic, particularly eye-catching against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Hong Kong from the best angle, you can leave the island and go to the opposite Kowloon coast.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land in the north.
This is the land of the British settlers, so if you want to find evidence of the history of the settlers, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest contiguous mangrove forest, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to the border with Bangladesh and the Indian mainland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). This part of the forest in India is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not only redwood forests. There are also some traces of giant coniferous forests, which once covered the Loess Plateau.
Sun Desheng's area is 3850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is water area/muddy area.
Since 1966, Sun Dels has been a wildlife reserve. It is estimated that there are currently 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 muntjac deer in the reserve.
There are always buses from the urban bus station (Cross River) throughout the day, but most buses, especially those to the east and Jakarta/Bandung, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
In view of the fact that the bus is often full, it is recommended to buy tickets in advance for a few days.

You can exchange currency at the only bank on the island, which is located in St. Martin and opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally used everywhere on the island, and credit cards and US dollars are often used in St. Martin.
In the outer islands, it may not be possible to use a credit card, but it is possible to use US dollars; please contact the owner in advance to confirm the acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the island, so it is necessary to exchange it before leaving the island.
The position of Mongolia is located in the south of the celestial equator, so when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there.
The Mongolian position is in the tropical region of Asia; in summer, the temperature is often above 30°C.
Winter may seem colder than it looks: the temperature is rarely below zero, but when the wind and humidity combine, it can feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There is no specific "rainy season" and "dry season" here: the annual rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are familiar with humans, wild animals are wild animals. We should not feed or harass them.
The manager of the park said: at least 100 meters away from the panda and the wolf, and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how warm and comfortable it is, almost all large animals, such as wild sheep, deer, horses, and pandas, can attack humans.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured by not maintaining a proper distance. These animals are large and wild, and potentially dangerous, so please give them some space.
In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the fact that the smell will attract pandas and other wild animals, so it is necessary to avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu, with a population of less than 40,000.

Anyone driving or crossing a mountain pass in a high-altitude area should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice or frost.
On the snow-covered road, the friction is small, and you can't drive like on a bright asphalt road.
During a sudden snowstorm, the accumulation of snow can paralyze you in a very short time.
Snowflakes, snowflakes, water drops or ice on the windshield may also block the view.
On the other hand, snow and ice weather is very common in many countries, and the traffic will not be interrupted throughout the year.
Hunting activities may be the most attractive tourism activities in Africa and the highlights of many tourists' trips.
The word "safari" refers to the common practice of traveling overland to watch stunning African wildlife, especially in the savanna.

If you have booked a 2020 flight and accommodation before announcing the postponement, you may face difficulties.
The cancellation of policies is not the same, but by the end of March, most of the cancellation of policies due to the new coronavirus have not been extended to July 2020 - the time of the original Olympic Games.
Ticket prices for most events are expected to be between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with an average price of about 7,000 yen.
Wet clothing can help it cool down. Even if the room is not hot and the blanket is not hot, many hotels provide a loan service.
If you don't like it or don't want to wear it, you can try it on a fan (if there is one).
Do not let the clothes get too hot (this may cause shrinkage, in extreme cases, the clothes will be burned).
There are many ways to purify water, and some are more effective for specific pollutants.
In some areas, a minute of cooking is enough, while it takes a few minutes in other areas.
