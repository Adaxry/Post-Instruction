New Questions Over California Water Project
Critics and a state lawmaker say they want more explanations on who's paying for a proposed $16 billion water project backed by Gov. Jerry Brown, after a leading California water district said Brown's administration was offering government funding to finish the planning for the two giant water tunnels.
Critics said the government funding described by the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District on Thursday could run counter to long-standing state assurances that various local water districts, not California itself, would pay for Brown's vision of digging twin 35-mile-long tunnels to carry water from the Sacramento River south, mainly for Central and Southern California.
The $248 million in preliminary spending for the tunnels, which have yet to win regulatory approval, already is the topic of an ongoing federal audit.
On Wednesday, state lawmakers ordered a state audit of the tunnels-spending as well.
On Thursday, state spokeswoman Nancy Vogel said that despite the account of the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District, no money from the state's general fund would be used finishing the current planning phase of the twin tunnels.
However, opponents of the tunnels and a taxpayer group were critical Thursday, and Assemblywoman Susan Eggman, one of the state lawmakers behind this week's audit order, asked the state Thursday for clarification.
"It's a shell game," said David Wolfe, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association's legislative director.
I think it comes back to the audit (request) yesterday: There are way more questions here than there are answers.
The tunnels project is endorsed by Brown and by some politically influential water districts and water customers in Central and Southern California.
Supporters say the tunnels would benefit the environment and offer Californians a more secure water supply.
Opponents say they fear the state will use the tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and San Francisco Bay, harming Northern California and further endangering native species there.
Metropolitan and other water districts slated to get water from the tunnels have yet to commit to paying for them, out of uncertainty whether the massive spending would really bring them enough water to make the cost worthwhile.
The same water districts also announced this year they would not pay to complete the current preliminary work on the tunnels unless the project first won regulatory approval.
On Thursday, a monthly report published by the LA-based water district on the tunnels project said, "the state has indicated that any additional funding needs to complete the planning phase will be provided by state or federal sources."
After all that local water districts had spent on the project, including $63 million from his water district, "This is to be expected" that the state would use government money to close out planning, said Bob Muir, spokesman for the LA-based water district.
He referred further questions to Vogel, the state spokeswoman.
Vogel said the state intended to pull money to finish the tunnels planning from user fees for an existing, half-century-old water network, the State Water Project.
Tunnel opponents, however, point to a measure state lawmakers passed in 2009 that they say bars the state from spending money on the tunnels until the water agencies that would benefit commit to paying for them.
"Project contractors pledged to pay for this project and they've used financial gimmicks to get around this obligation," said Patricia Schifferle, an environmental consultant and longtime opponent of the proposed tunnels.
It raises questions as to where this money was suddenly found.
Business Groups Appeal to China Over Cybersecurity Law
A coalition of international business groups has appealed to China to change proposed cybersecurity rules they warn will harm trade and isolate the country.
The letter to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is signed by 46 groups from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, reflecting the global scale of concern the rules might limit or cut off access to China's market for information security products.
Signers include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules would require providers to show Chinese authorities how security products work and to store information about Chinese citizens within the country.
The latest letter, dated Wednesday, says that might make data theft easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
Tianjin chemical blast: Deadly disaster marked one year on
Zhang Mengfan says the public deserves to know what happened in the Tianjin blasts
China's leaders may want muted commemorations to mark the first anniversary of the massive chemical blast that killed 173 people, but not everyone agrees.
John Sudworth reports from Tianjin.
Almost anywhere else in the world the anniversary of a disaster of this magnitude would present a moment of national soul-searching.
But not in China.
While a memorial service to some of the dead firefighters is being held in the city of Tianjin, elsewhere the tributes are being muted.
The Communist Party-controlled media is being told what it can and cannot say and some survivors, as well as family members of the dead, are being warned not to speak to the foreign press.
But 23-year-old Zhang Mengfan won't stay quiet.
"On this anniversary there should be a way for the public to know what happened," he tells me.
I don't want silence.
On 12 August last year, Mr Zhang was a radio operator with a military fire brigade, stationed just a kilometre from the epicentre of the explosions.
"The call came in at 10:53 that night and we started to despatch my teammates," he says.
It would have taken them 10 minutes to get to the scene.
Other crews from elsewhere in the city were also arriving to tackle the large fire in a chemical storage depot.
All of them would have been oblivious to the fact that large quantities of volatile and toxic substances were being illegally stored, way beyond permitted amounts and without proper management.
The fire had started when a batch of nitrocellulose - a chemical used in nail polish - had been allowed to dry out and then ignited in the summer heat.
It then spread to a huge stockpile - 800 tonnes - of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.
The resulting explosions shattered the windows and brought the roof in at the fire station where Zhang Mengfan was waiting by the radio for reports from the scene.
Those reports never came in.
"When I saw the mushroom cloud I fell into a state of desperation," he tells me.
I knew what it would mean for my friends.
Of the 26 firefighters sent to the blaze from his unit that night, eight never came back.
Many of the others suffered serious burns and other injuries.
The biggest of the two large explosions was measured as a seismic event, with a blast wave that was felt many kilometres away.
The total cost of the damage was put at more than $1bn, including the 300-plus buildings that were destroyed.
A total of 173 people lost their lives - 104 of them firefighters.
Eight bodies have never been found.
An official government enquiry has laid the blame squarely at corruption, political connections and official collusion that allowed corners to be cut and safety systems to be overridden.
The storage depot should never have been built so close to residential buildings in the first place.
More than 100 officials and company executives are facing some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
So while the government can point to the progress that has been made - the thousands of homes repaired and the residents compensated - those lingering sensitivities remain.
The disaster has exposed the cracks in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent oversight is a fact of life.
The bravery and sense of duty that night cannot be doubted and yet alongside the image of the firefighter as hero, there is the other uncomfortable picture.
That of the firefighter as victim, sent without proper knowledge into an avoidable, man-made catastrophe.
Zhang Mengfan has now left the fire service but will attend the memorial service in Tianjin.
He will be carrying in his heart a message for his dead comrades.
What I want to tell them most is this: I've been to visit your parents and they are fine.
Leave your parents to me.
I am a member of your family now.
I will fulfil your filial duty.
Cold spring could affect Scottish grouse shooting season
Scotland's grouse shooting season will begin later, with cold weather hitting bird numbers this year.
Several estates have postponed shooting as many of the early chicks did not survive the cool spring conditions.
Marking the start of the season, the Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA) said grouse shooting sustained more jobs than the Edinburgh festivals.
But animal protection charity OneKind called for an end to the "brutal slaughter" of the birds.
The organisation's director Harry Huyton said: "The effort which goes into maintaining a rich supply of game birds for shooting is huge and invariably involves some extremely controversial practices."
It is not surprising the public is turning their back on this so-called sport and calling the government to account on a cruel, unnecessary practice which is enjoyed by a very small minority of people in Scotland.
But landowners insisted they were committed to conservation and that grouse shooting was vital to the rural economy.
The SGA's chairman, Alex Hogg, said the industry supported 8,800 full-time jobs per year in remote areas and was a "rich seam of employment" in uncertain times.
He said: "Compared to many other European countries, Scotland does not have an embedded 'hunting' culture and chunks of the population don't know the impact the shooting seasons have to the country, economically."
Mr Hogg said the number of full-time jobs relying on shooting exceeded the posts created by the Edinburgh International Festival, the Fringe, Tattoo and Hogmanay combined.
He added: "There are real concerns for employment in rural Scotland at the moment, particularly in oil and gas, so gamekeepers and their families want to see the industry grow.
We want to work with the Scottish government to make sure hard working people can continue to rely on these posts in future.
RSPB Scotland believes that eight golden eagles have been killed illegally around grouse moors
Many gamekeepers acknowledge that grouse shooting is not universally popular, but the SGA said the industry had made "significant strides in terms of best practice."
The opening day of the grouse shooting season is traditionally known as the "Glorious Twelfth."
However, the sport remains controversial and the management of grouse shooting moors has been linked to the persecution of raptors by some wildlife bodies.
On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said eight tagged golden eagles had disappeared in the Monadhliath mountains, south-east of Inverness, in less than five years.
The wildlife charity believes they were killed illegally around grouse moors and their satellite tracking tags destroyed.
Scottish Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the reports were "very disturbing and disappointing."
Ms Cunningham has ordered officials to analyse the evidence of about 90 surviving and missing eagles with the tags, to determine if there is a pattern of suspicious activity.
The Scottish Moorland Group accused the RSPB of trying to whip up anti-shooting feelings ahead of the grouse season and said there was no clear evidence of the birds having even died in the Monadhliath area.
Rio Olympics 2016: Bryony Page wins trampoline silver for Great Britain
GB's Page wins silver in the trampolining
Bryony Page became the first British woman to win an Olympic trampoline medal by claiming silver in Rio.
Page, 25, was beaten to gold by 0.425 points as Canada's Rosannagh MacLennan won a second successive Olympic title with a score of 56.465.
World champion Li Dan of China took bronze, while Britain's other finalist, Katherine Driscoll, came sixth.
I can't believe I've won an Olympic medal.
I'm just so happy," said a clearly emotional Page.
I had no idea it was a medal but my performance was the best I could have done, that is why I was so happy, that all the training and hard work had paid off.
I am so happy I got to share the final with Kat, one person would have been history and we got two.
Prior to winning Olympic silver, Page's highest career finish in an international event was fifth at the 2015 World Championships in Denmark.
Trampoline made its Olympic debut in 2000 and this is the first time British women have reached the final.
Reaction to the medal.
Team GB's Nathan Bailey, the only male entrant in the men's trampoline on Saturday, was ecstatic.
Two-time Olympian gymnast Hannah Whelan was quick to heap praise on Page's achievement.
Page secured a first class honours degree in Biology at the University of Sheffield.
Rio 2016: Fiji fans celebrate winning rugby sevens gold medal
A 12-year-old boy runs past sugar cane fields on a half-mile journey to the nearest television set in order to watch the game
Extraordinary scenes of celebration have erupted after Fiji won its first-ever Olympic medal.
Banks closed, shops shut and revellers took over the streets of Suva dancing, singing and cheering.
Fiji claimed the gold medal after defeating Great Britain 43-7 in the rugby sevens final at Deodoro Stadium.
Thousands of people across the island nation had stopped what they were doing to watch the history-making match.
Fiji celebrates as the country wins its first ever Olympic medal
Many supporters dressed in Fiji colours and rugby jerseys, carrying the national flag to cheer on the team.
At the final whistle blew, excited revellers took to the streets cheering and dancing.
"Some people even stopped their vehicles on the busy streets of Suva and got out with Fiji flags to join the celebrations, not paying much heed to the slight traffic jam they cause," the Fiji Times reported.
The celebrations will definitely continue into the weekend and the week ahead.
League of Ireland Premier Division: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Aaron McEneff netted two first-half penalties for the visitors at Finn Park
Derry City have moved up to second in the Premier Division thanks to a thumping 5-0 derby win over Finn Harps.
Aaron McEneff put the Candystripes in control with two first-half penalties, both given for fouls on Lukas Schubert.
Nathan Boyle fired home early in the second half and Schubert hammered in the fourth before Keith Ward's late lob completed the Finn Park rout.
Derry go a point ahead of Cork City and the teams meet at the Brandywell on Monday night in a crunch encounter.
It was Derry's first win over their north-west rivals in three meetings this season and they were rarely troubled by a disappointing Harps side.
McEneff tucked away the opener on 17 minutes after Ciaran Coll's challenge on Schubert, although the foul appeared to be outside the box.
There was no doubt the second spot-kick, with former Candystripes midfielder Barry Molloy bringing downing Schubert and McEneff making it 2-0 three minutes from the break.
Boyle produced a clinical finish from a Dean Jarvis cut-back eight minutes after the restart.
City keeper Gerard Doherty had a quiet night but he made a fine save to deny David Scully in the host's best opening of the game.
Schubert flicked the ball past Coll before blasting in after 83 minutes and it was soon followed by Ward's clever chip over Harps stopper Richard Brush.
It was Derry's biggest win of the campaign and perfect preparation for the showdown with Cork.
Probe after mass failure of Inverness College UHI course
An entire class of 20 students may have failed a Higher Media course run by Inverness College UHI.
Most of those on the course were 17 and 18-year-olds hoping to use their mark from their studies to go to university.
Inverness College UHI said quality assurance processes were in place, adding that the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) was investigating.
A spokesman for the SQA said the nationally-available 2016 Higher Media assessment had "performed as intended."
Twenty students signed up for the Inverness College UHI-run and marked course.
Many of the students were young people in rural areas who received tuition online, but also had to make frequent visits to the college in Inverness from where they lived in places such as Lochaber.
A father of one of the students said that, following postings by his daughter on social media about her no award for her work, at least 10 others had come forward to say they had also been given a no award for their course work.
He told BBC News Scotland online that about five other people who sat the same course at Inverness College UHI last year had also been in touch to say the same thing had happened to them.
The situation meant his daughter not being able to secure a place at the University of Glasgow, but she will be able to take up an offer from another university because of qualifications she gained at school.
But her father said there were others who did the college-run media course who were less fortunate and were now "in limbo" and unsure if their course work would be re-examined and then given a mark that would allow them to take up university places.
Inverness College UHI is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands.
Diane Rawlinson, principal and chief executive at Inverness College UHI, said: "We take exam results and student success very seriously."
This is evidenced by the excellent HMIE report we received earlier this year as well as the year-on-year improvements to attainment levels we have achieved in both Further and Higher education.
As we do every year, we are undertaking a review of all published results, comparing them against those projected for each student.
In the case of this particular course, the usual quality assurance processes were in place and the awarding body verifier recently reported 'significant strengths in the delivery and management of this award' and confirmed that 'assessment judgements were consistent with the national standards set'.
SQA are currently investigating this matter at our request.
A spokesman for the SQA said: "We are happy that the 2016 Higher Media assessment performed as intended and it provided candidates with the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject.
Many candidates performed strongly and we saw a slight increase in the A-C attainment rate compared to the same qualification last year.
It was designed in line with past and exemplar papers and according to our course and assessment specifications.
Brothers jailed for samurai sword 'bloodbath' in Kilmarnock
Jason Bryden was attacked with a samurai sword, knife and nunchucks
Two brothers have been jailed for killing a man with a samurai sword after a drugs-related robbery in East Ayrshire turned into a "bloodbath."
The victim, Jason Bryden, 38, was repeatedly stabbed during the attack at his home in Kilmarnock on 5 July 2015.
At the High Court in Glasgow, James Clark, 36, was jailed for a least 22 years after being convicted of murder.
His brother John, 38, was jailed for 10 years after being convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide.
Jailing both men, judge Bill Dunlop told the brothers that they had carried out "a merciless, relentless and savage attack."
He rejected any suggestion that Mr Bryden had been laying in wait for them armed with a samurai sword.
Judge Dunlop added: "You together planned to gain illegal access with at least one knife and nunchucks.
Jason Bryden may have been a drug dealer but he was a son, a father and a friend.
He was butchered by you.
After both men were jailed, Det Insp David Moran, who led the investigation, said: "The violent and terrible actions of John and James Clark caused the death of Jason Bryden."
To be taken at the age of 38, in such horrifying circumstances, is a heartbreaking situation that the family has been forced to endure.
The court previously heard the brothers, from Kilmarnock, had decided to rob Mr Bryden of a gold bracelet which they had given to him in exchange for drugs.
The pair, who were high on drink and drugs, went to his home after masking their faces with scarves and arming themselves with a knife and martial arts nunchucks.
The sword used in the killing is believed to have belonged to the dead man.
Neighbours said they could see the Clarks attacking Mr Bryden as he sat on a sofa by the window and could hear him screaming.
Prosecutor Richard Goddard told the trial: "This was a sustained, frenzied attack on this man."
Afterwards, the scene of the killing was described as a "bloodbath."
In addition to the stab wounds, Mr Bryden suffered blunt force trauma during the assault.
He died in Kilmarnock's Crosshouse Hospital three days later.
Both brothers denied the killing.
In evidence, James Clark, who has 38 previous convictions including one for attempted murder, said: "I didn't mean it. It was an accident."
John Clark, who has 23 previous convictions, said he only got involved to help his brother whom he claimed was being attacked by Mr Bryden.
Man jailed for shaking and killing his baby son
David Sinclair admitted killing the child at his home in East Kilbride in 2012
A man who shook and killed his baby son in a fit of rage because he would not feed has been jailed for seven years and three months.
David Sinclair shook four-month-old Joshua in a "momentary loss of control" at their home in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, on 6 December 2012.
The cause of death was only discovered after a case review by medical experts.
Sinclair, 34, was originally charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of culpable homicide.
Jailing him at the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Bracadale told Sinclair: "You assaulted your baby son by shaking him, causing the injuries which killed him."
You must have known at the time you had shaken him, but you did not disclose that.
It was only after extensive medical investigations you admitted what you had done.
Your wife believed in you.
She now feels she had been misled by you and can no longer support you.
Lord Bracadale described the effects of Joshua's death as "catastrophic" for all concerned and added: "Nothing can bring Joshua back."
The court previously heard that that on the day the child died, Sinclair and his wife Kirsty had gone swimming with Joshua and then shopping in East Kilbride.
At 17:30 Kirsty Sinclair went out to meet her mother and sister.
Just 11 minutes later she received a phone call from Sinclair, who sounded "shocked."
He told her: "Joshua isn't breathing properly, come home right away."
He then hung up and dialled 999.
The infant was rushed to Hairmyres Hospital where he died.
Initially the cause of Joshua's death was unascertained, but the case was reviewed by a team of medical experts who discovered evidence of trauma in the eyes and brain which could only have been caused non-accidentally, close to the time of death.
One of the experts, Dr Peter Richards, consultant paediatric neuro-surgeon at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, said: "This would be compatible with him having suffered a shaking injury involving handling at greater force than encountered in everyday life."
Defending QC, Ian Duguid, told the court that Sinclair was "extremely remorseful" for his actions.
Rio Olympics 2016: Chloe Tutton appears to question Yulia Efimova
GB's Tutton misses 200m breaststroke bronze
Great Britain's Chloe Tutton appeared to criticise controversial swimmer Yulia Efimova's presence in Rio after the Russian finished ahead of her in the 200m breaststroke.
Efimova, who was allowed to compete after appealing against a doping ban, took silver with Tutton fourth.
"I would've preferred it to have been a completely clean Games," the 20-year-old Welsh swimmer said afterwards.
I couldn't help who was here.
I'm not happy with it, but that's how it is.
Efimova in second place didn't even know she was in the games until three days ago.
I don't want to see people taken out of the sport, but I don't think that's quite right.
She shouldn't have been in the race and a 20-year-old from Britain should have had a medal.
Rie Kaneto won Japan's seventh gold medal at Rio 2016 to beat Efimova into silver.
China's Jinglin Shi won bronze, just six one-hundreths of a second ahead of fourth-placed Tutton.
Her British team-mate Molly Renshaw, 20, finished sixth.
"Being fourth is a bit gutting, no matter who is in front of you," Tutton added.
It's a great experience and I'm a bit disappointed to come fourth.
I'm so close to a medal and that would have been a dream.
But just to get into the final is a great experience that I'll take on with me for years to come.
It was a bit gutting but it will make me tough in the long run and it just makes me more hungry for a medal so hopefully next time I'll get closer.
Tutton finished just 0.01 seconds outside the British record in the women's 200m breaststroke final
'Everyone should have a second chance' - Efimova
Efimova, who said she was tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended her right to compete at Rio.
She was banned for 16 months in 2013 after traces of an anabolic steroid were found in her system.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has ruled that athletes cannot be banned from Rio on the basis that they have been previously sanctioned.
CAS considered my appeal and I won.
If someone dislikes it and has a different opinion, they can go to CAS," she explained.
I am not for doping and I have never used it.
The second case was completely not my fault.
Everyone should have a second chance.
When you drive and you are just issued a ticket, no-one puts you in jail.
Ben Proud powers to 50m freestyle final
Earlier, Ben Proud set a British record to reach the men's 50m freestyle final.
Commonwealth champion Proud, 21, swam a time of 21.54 seconds to qualify fifth fastest for Friday's final (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is pushy and rude
India's sports minister, Vijay Goel, has been a conspicuous presence at Rio's Olympic Games, frequently spotted in the stands cheering on Indian athletes and taking selfies after their events.
But he and his large entourage have apparently raised the ire of Olympic officials with unruly behavior, repeatedly trying to push their way into competition zones without the proper credentials and responding rudely when checked, the Press Trust of India reported.
Vijay Goel, pictured in July, has defended his behaviour.
On Wednesday, Olympic organizers threatened to withdraw Goel's accreditation if the behavior did not improve, sending a warning letter after he and his entourage tried to enter restricted areas in the gymnastics venue and the arena where fencing and taekwondo is held.
"We have had multiple reports of your Minister for Sports trying to enter accredited areas at venues with unaccredited individuals," Sarah Peterson, continental manager of the Rio 2016 Organizing Committee wrote in the note.
When the staff tried to explain that this is not allowed, they reported that the people with the Minister have become aggressive and rude and sometimes pushed past our staff.
"Should our protocol team be made aware of further examples of this type of behavior, the accreditation of your Minister for Sports will be cancelled and his privileges at the Olympic Games withdrawn," the letter continued.
The leader of the Indian delegation called the matter "a non-issue being made an issue" and Goel himself said he had done nothing wrong, chalking it up to a "misunderstanding."
He tweeted, "To my knowledge, we have been following all rules & regulations.
We are committed to the spirit of Olympics & back our Indian players.
Otherwise it's been a gloomy Olympics for India, with zero medals so far.
Bummed-out fans on social media noted that Michael Phelps now has as many medals - 26 - as India has won in its history.
Several prominent contenders have already been eliminated, including shooter Abhinav Bindra who won a gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
He placed fourth this time.
What a waste of money and opportunity," author and columnist Shobhaa De said in a sardonic tweet.
But some bright hopes remain, with competitors foraging ahead in boxing, golf, tennis, track and field and, yes, badminton.
The lone Indian woman gymnast, Dipa Karmakar, will compete in the vault finals on Sunday - showing off her fearsome double revolution "Vault of Death," the Produnova, attempted by few other gymnasts.
For a country of 1.25 billion people, India's low medal count has always been a source of consternation.
Analysts say that there are myriad reasons for this.
The national obsession is cricket, which is not an Olympic sport.
India has not invested heavily in infrastructure and training for Olympians - Karmakar's first vault was made from parts of an old scooter.
Parents have historically emphasized academics over sport.
And the sports' governing bodies have been dogged by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee suspended the Indian Olympic Association for violations of its charter in 2012 because they had elected leaders with pending criminal charges.
In Sochi, India's three winter Olympians were not even allowed to compete for their country, carry the flag or wear the insignia.
They competed as independents.
Injuries force turbulence-rocked Boston-Sacramento JetBlue flight to land in South Dakota
A JetBlue plane was forced to make an unexpected landing Thursday evening after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during turbulence, reports CBS Sacramento.
Flight 429, from Boston to Sacramento, landed in Rapid City, South Dakota shortly before 7:30 p.m. local time.
The airline says the injured were transported to a hospital for evaluation.
JetBlue says it sent personnel to assist the injured, and a replacement aircraft was flown to Rapid City to take the rest of the passengers on to Sacramento.
DEA's missed opportunity on medical marijuana
The answer sadly is: unlikely.
And this is a missed opportunity that could further delay potential therapies to countless people.
Up until today, there has been only one federally approved source of research-grade medical marijuana, at the University of Mississippi.
In a bit of seemingly positive news today, the DEA also announced it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.
The hope is that marijuana available for scientific study could grow in both amount and diversity.
While this will be hailed as a victory for research, it will largely be symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access is still difficult, it hardly matters.
Imagine a product that is in high demand but kept behind a locked door.
In response to the demand for the product, someone makes a baffling decision to make more of it but still never unlocks the door.
Marijuana is that product, and its Schedule I designation is that locked door.
That is the predicament of medical marijuana.
Because marijuana is a Schedule I substance (meaning that by definition it has "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse"), there are significant hurdles to getting the door unlocked.
Potential researchers typically go to the DEA first, as it grants the license to begin scientific research.
Even if a license is granted, to study a Schedule I substance, institutions must have heavy-duty safes and high-grade security systems installed, which can be expensive.
There is also the more subjective consideration of getting approval from your academic institution to do the research on a Schedule I status substance in the first place.
Even if individual faculty members want to do that research, the university leadership may not want the hassle or the potential fallout of bad press.
This happened at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sue Sisley was let go after trying to pursue a medical marijuana trial.
Sisley eventually had to find private funding for her project, and just in April, seven years after the study was initially proposed, hers became the first DEA approved medical marijuana trial for post-traumatic stress in veterans.
Then, after years of bureaucratic hurdles, it is the National Institute on Drug Abuse that has held the final key to the lock.
Today, it is the biggest federal public funder of marijuana research and has been the sole supplier of the marijuana itself.
Even if more medical marijuana will now be freed up for research, the institute will still have to approve any studies it funds.
The problem, however, is that last word in its name: "abuse."
According to Dr. Donald Abrams at the University of San Francisco, whom I interviewed for my documentary "Weed," the institute has a primary mandate to study substances for potential abuse rather than as a medicine.
Abrams makes an important point.
Even if a study does cross all the hurdles described above, the door may stay locked if the intent is to study the benefits of medical marijuana as opposed to the harm.
Consider this: A quick (and admittedly non-scientific) search through the U.S. National Library of Medicine pulled up 1,434 papers on medical marijuana over the past five years.
That same search revealed only 57 papers on medical marijuana benefits.
The vast majority were research into the harm of marijuana, such as "Bad trip due to anticholinergic effect of cannabis," "Cannabis induced pancreatitits" and "Marijuana use and risk of lung cancer."
That imbalance paints a highly distorted picture.
The road to medical marijuana research is paved with surprises and hypocrisy nearly everywhere you look.
While the DEA continues to dig in on Schedule I status, deeming no medical benefit, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services simultaneously holds a patent on cannabinoids for a wide range of medicinal purposes.
The DEA continues to place marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as drugs with high abuse potential even though the DEA's own former chief administrative law judge, Francis Young, disagreed with this.
In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume.
For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response.
By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death.
Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.
By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within the supervised routine of medical care.
Again, that was from a judge with the DEA itself.
And yet nearly 30 years later, little has changed.
Whether we realize it or not, we all accept a certain amount of hypocrisy in our daily lives.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to call it out or we are too speechless and dumbfounded that no one else seems to have noticed.
With regard to the hypocrisy of federal medical marijuana policy, however, it is worth summoning the stamina to relentlessly present the facts.
The lives of patients -- such as that of Charlotte Figi, whose seizures abated with the use of medical marijuana, and so many others -- depend on it.
That a plant could provide so much benefit and still remain behind these locked doors is worth speaking up about.
Bloody Beetroots: Donald Trump 'a blonde Berlusconi'
The Bloody Beetroots is known for electronic dance music
The musicians say Trump's dominance of the media is similar to Berlusconi's
"You know, we used to have Berlusconi in Italy and to me, Trump looks like a blonde Berlusconi," Rifo, who is the founder of electro-dance punk formation, The Bloody Beetroots, told CNN.
The Republican presidential nominee and the Italian media mogul turned politician are both known for their larger than life personalities, their skills in capturing the attention of the press and shaping narratives in the media.
As the Bloody Beetroots, Rifo is known for his electronic dance music and has collaborated with artists from the legendary Sir Paul McCartney to electro-pop singer Greta Svabo Bech in the 2013 song, "Chronicles of a Fallen Love."
Rifo was born in the Italian town of Bessano del Grappa outside Venice in 1977, which is around the time punk rock was born, and the numbers "1977" are tattooed across the musician's chest.
"English is not my main language so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said from behind a black mask, which he is known for.
I try to explore and I've been trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo urged Americans to watch "Videocracy," a documentary which explores Berlusconi's monopoly over the Italian media.
The documentary is about "how Berlusconi used to drive Italy crazy," Rifo said, adding that Trump has had a similar effect on America.
"You see the way a man can completely invert the system and curve everything ... for his wants," he said.
Trump, to me, looks like something that is not good for this country.
Two Turkish sailors jailed over £500 million drugs bust
Two Turkish men convicted of smuggling £500 million worth of cocaine on board a ship in the North Sea have each been jailed for at least 20 years.
Mumin Sahin and Emin Ozmen were found guilty after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow after three tonnes of the Class A drug were discovered inside the MV Hamal about 100 miles off the coast of Aberdeen.
The 2015 seizure is said to be the biggest single cocaine haul ever recovered at sea in Europe.
Mumin Sahin and Emin Ozmen have been jailed for their role in a huge drug deal
The massive haul of drugs found on the boat is one of the biggest in British history
The drugs were found hidden in a specially-adapted secret hold in the Tanzanian-registered tugboat, which was sailing from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.
It was stopped by the Royal Navy frigate HMS Somerset and Border Force cutter HMC Valiant.
Sahin, 47, was sentenced to 22 years while Ozmen, 51, was handed down a 20-year term at the High Court in Glasgow.
Judge Lord Kinclaven told the men the quantity of drugs was 'not only significant but massive' and drugs trafficking had a 'devastating impact' on people and communities.
He said: 'You were involved in a most serious operation of commercial scale involving the transportation of cocaine by ship, in an operation which crossed international and indeed intercontinental boundaries.'
He told the ship's captain Sahin, he was 'not at the top of the drugs tree' but had played an important role in the offence, while second captain Ozmen's role was 'to some extent a lesser one'.
Officers boarded the Hamal following a tip-off from French customs body DNRED, and once it was docked in Aberdeen they drilled through a steel plate into a secret compartment to find 128 bales of cocaine weighing 3.2 tonnes, with an estimated street value of £512 million.
MV Hamal was boarded by the Royal Navy last year.
Three tonnes of cocaine was onboard
Tonnes of the Class-A drug were crammed in the ship's ballast tank when it was raided
The ship went from the Bosporus to South America before being stopped in the North Sea
The entry to the space was found under a wardrobe in one of the crew's quarters, with the opening cemented over.
Sahin and Ozmen were found guilty of being concerned with the carrying and concealing of cocaine on the ship between February 20 and April 23 last year, and of being concerned in the supply of cocaine between April 21 and April 23.
The men, both first offenders who have worked in the shipping industry since leaving school, continue to maintain their innocence but accept the jury's verdict.
Charges against four other men were found not proven.
Sahin's lawyer, Jonathan Crowe, said the married father-of-two was a 'glorified mule'.
He said: 'Someone who was involved in the transportation of the drugs.'
Someone who was able to captain a boat.
In regard to the drugs hierarchy, Mr Sahin is certainly not at the top of the drugs tree but somewhere further down.
The sheer amount of cocaine on the ship meant they had to be removed by a crane
Police spent days going through the boat before the drugs were divided into these boxes
Sahin was approached about captaining the Hamal in February 2015, the court heard.
Mr Crowe said he is 'devastated' about missing out on milestones for his daughter, nine, and son, 13, and 'just wants to go home to Turkey'.
Both men have not seen their families since being taken into custody in April 2015 as their families struggle to get visa approval.
Ozmen's lawyer, Di Moore, said he is 'desperate' to see his family but knows that will 'remain impossible' for the foreseeable future.
Speaking following today's sentencing, Scotland's Crown Agent prosecutor David Harvie said: 'The international drugs trade does not respect borders, and those of us whose job it is to dismantle it are working ever-closer together to ensure we stay one step ahead.
'Scotland's reach in pursuing criminals is on a truly global scale and in this case we have dealt a substantial economic blow to organised criminals.'
Drugs were packed into every cavity in the boat, including under the floors
This package of contraband was found hidden in the ship's laundry room by officers
Mr Harvie added:'The Hamal was identified after an intelligence tip-off from French authorities, and swift co-operation from the Attorney General in Tanzania where the ship was registered allowed it to be boarded.
'Our investigation then stretched from Guyana, who provided access to crucial shipping records, to Spain, who gave us crucial information on the ship's stop-offs in the Canary Islands.
We also worked with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to piece specific elements of the evidence together.
Despite strong intelligence that the Hamal was carrying a large volume of drugs, it could not be boarded in international waters by the UK authorities without the permission of the Tanzanian government - something they had never previously granted.
Sue Patten, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) International Justice and Organised Crime Division, said: 'Acting quickly and precisely, the CPS criminal justice adviser in Tanzania was able get permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board the boat within 24 hours of receiving the intelligence.
Under international maritime law, the UK cannot board a vessel in international waters which is under the flag of a foreign state unless that state gives specific legal permission to do so.
Without the swift actions of our criminal justice adviser, there was a high risk that the vessel may have escaped and we would never have been able to bring these men to justice.
Photographer Brian Romeijn captures the decaying 'Orient Express' train
Rotterdam-based photographer Brian Romeijn snapped these photos of an abandoned train in Belgium
Images show the train's rusting exterior, torn seats, dust-covered windows and compact engineer's room
It has gained a reputation as an Orient Express carriage, but it belonged to Belgium's national operator
An urban explorer has captured these remarkable photos of the decaying remains of a passenger train that was once one of the finest ways to travel.
With their glory days long gone, the train carriage and locomotive have been left to rot at a train yard in Belgium, where they have become a popular attraction for photographers and adventurers.
Rotterdam-based photographer Brian Romeijn, 40, snapped these eerie images, which show the abandoned train's rusting exterior, torn seats, dust-covered windows and floors and compact engineer's room.
The train carriage and locomotive have been left to rot at a train yard in Belgium, attracting urban explorers
Those trains were a symbol of luxury when they operated under that legendary name from 1883 to 2009.
The locomotive was used by Belgium's national rail company around 50 years ago.
After 126 years on the rails, the last train service operating under the Orient Express name was from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, bringing an end to a celebrated history.
The Orient Express famously operated between Paris and Istanbul.
When it started in 1883 - run by La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits - it was known as the Express d'Orient.
It became the Orient Express in 1891 and by the 1930s operated scheduled services throughout Europe.
It's not to be confused with the privately run Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.
Very few Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits luxury carriages still exist.
This snap shows the compact engineer's room, where equipment is rusting, gauges are still installed and wires are exposed
Romeijn said the engineer's room was 'kind of claustrophobic and the noise of the engine must have been tremendous'
The abandoned locomotive and carriage have become a popular attraction for photographers and adventurers
After visiting the forgotten train in Belgium, Romeijn told MailOnline Travel: 'I really could feel how it must have been used in its heyday.

Lancashire father banned from children's school after wearing T-shirt with swear word
A father-of-two has been banned from his children's school for turning up at their sports day in an offensive T-shirt.
Craig McBeth, 36, from Burnley, in Lancashire, says he 'accidentally' wore the top with the slogan "Let's get out there and t**t it'.
But despite apologising when he realised his error and turning the T-shirt inside out, the next day he discovered he was barred from the school grounds.
The single father, who had been a governor for four years at Park Primary School, in Colne, Burnley, was unable to pick up his kids because of the ban and the staff even called social services and the police.
Craig McBeth, 36, from Burnley says he was barred from the school grounds after wearing this offensive T-shirt to his children's sports day
Mr Burnley has accused head teacher Sarah Midgely of overreacting.
He said he is being unfairly punished for mistakenly putting on the T-shirt in a rush before going to watch his two children compete.
The dad, who has now quit as a school governor, said: "It was a mistake, and an oversight on my part.
I was not thinking about sports day and rushing when I put it on.
Towards the end of the event we were having a father's race and the head teacher noticed my T-shirt and said it was not appropriate.
I apologised and turned it inside out and thought that was the end of the matter.
But the 36-year-old said he received an email from the chairman of governors later that evening asking him to meet with the head the next day, but he did not see the need after he had already apologised.
"The headteacher then phoned me and said I was barred from the school premises," added Mr Burnley,
I found out after the sports day some of the parents went on Facebook and made a fuss about it and that got a lot of people interested.
Any right-minded person would think this was an overreaction.
Mr McBeth, who is the editor of an online magazine called Love Mini, said he believed he could not even pick his children up on the last day of term, because of the ban.
But this prompted a phone call from the school and social services.
The t-shirt had a picture of Craig Charles's character Lister from the cult BBC comedy Red Dwarf with one of his iconic lines -'Let's go out and t**t it.'
He commented: "I told them I was not there because they had banned me from the school.
I then got a phone call from social services asking why I had not picked my daughter up.
The school also called the police because I did not pick up my daughter for about 40 minutes.
Mr McBeth claims he was told he is no longer permitted to come on to the school premises and the prohibition will continue until further notice.
He says he was also warned he could face a fine of £500 if found trespassing.
Sarah Midgley, headteacher at Park Primary School, said this matter is now closed
Sarah Midgley, headteacher at Park Primary School, said: "I can confirm that Mr McBeth has resigned and is no longer a governor at our school.
This matter is now closed and I'm looking forward to getting back to normal school life in September.
Burnley councillor Joe Cooney said the school had clear policies and guidelines.
"We all have to bear in mind when you take on these roles such as a councillor or governor you are held to a higher standard and unfortunately this time he has not met that standard," he said.
Councillor Jonathan Nixon added he did not think the school should have banned him and the situation had been blown out of proportion.
Mr Nixon added: "He was stupid to wear the T-shirt and he apologised at the time."
Lancashire Police confirmed they were called by the school, but did not attend.
65% of Venezuelans want to oust Maduro, the question is if they are willing to fight for it
Two out of three Venezuelans want to revoke President Nicolas Maduro, but the question seems to be whether or not they are willing to fight for it.
The day after the National Electoral Board announced that there is "no time" for the recall vote to take place this year - securing Chavismo's grip of power until 2019 - people in Caracas went about their day as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I was watching the Olympics and how Michael Phelps won two more medals," said Rafael Deyan, a 36-year-old office clerk taking a break in Altamira Square on Wednesday.
Altamira Square, located in the east of Caracas, was the epicenter in early 2014 of fierce riots protesting against Maduro's regime.
Yet now, when the opposition needs to apply more pressure than ever to make the referendum happens this year, people across the country are not showing the same energy.
"I want a referendum, but I won't protest for security reasons," said Deyan.
Others, more informed, are willing to mobilize in the future but admit Venezuelans are less motivated.
Electoral board president Tibisay Lucena's comments prove that the government is hindering the recall process.
I will protest whenever the opposition calls for a protest, but I know that some of my friends are scared," Roberto Reyes, 60, told Fox News Latino.
So on top to the many barriers the government has raised to delay the referendum, the opposition now faces another challenge: motivating people to go out to the streets and protest.
Until recently the referendum initiative had plenty of support - people moved in unprecedented numbers during the collection of signatures phase.
But when it comes to protesting against the government's maneuvers to block the effort, turnout at rallies have been ostensibly low.
"Some people are focused in making food lines, while others are scared after the many arrests and deaths in 2014," said Cipriano Heredia, a lawmaker for the opposition.
After Lucena announced that the next step in the referendum process - gather yet more signatures countrywide - would have to wait until October, those opposed to the socialist government claim President Maduro and his acolytes are just trying to discourage Venezuelans, making them believe that a vote this year is all but impossible.
According to the Constitution, if the referendum were to be held in 2017, Maduro could be forced out of office but he would be allowed to name a successor.
If he were ousted this year, however, he is mandated to call for a general election.
The U.S. Department of State addressed the issue in a statement Thursday afternoon, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to guarantee the exercise of the constitutional rights of the Venezuelan people.
"The remaining steps for the realization of the Presidential Recall Referendum need to be pursued clearly, concretely and without delay, and thus contribute to the quick and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social difficulties in the country," it read.
Luis Salamanca, a political analyst who was a member of the Electoral Board between 2006 and 2009, said change is not likely anytime soon.
"I think that there will not be a referendum this year, unless the social unrest and protests grow much more," he told FNL.
He said that in his view Lucena and the government are breaking the law, but they may ultimately achieve their goal if people don't protest loud enough.
The opposition has called for a big rally on Sept. 1st in Caracas to demand a speed-up of the process so the recall can take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to mobilize to the capital city on that day.
The government will feel the pressure," Heredia said.
But Salamanca thinks that the situation can't wait that long.
"They should have a quicker and stronger response to Lucena's announcement because it practically kills the referendum," the expert told FNL.
Congressman Heredia admitted that some parties inside the opposition are pushing to make the rally sooner, but other groups prefer to have more time to organize.
The opposition has to be careful now.
If people get discouraged by the situation there is a risk of low turnout in the second round of signature petition," said Salamanca.
The referendum process has to count with the support of 20 percent of the country's electorate, close to 4 million people, in order to be activated.
Salamanca and other analysts are confident that even if the recall takes place on 2017, Chavismo will be hurt.
But some are not that optimistic.
Our party wants political change this year.
"If the government closes down the electoral path, we will have to explore other legal options," Heredia told FNL.
Premier League 2016-17 previews No19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian writers" predicted position 14th (NB: this is not necessarily Alan Smith's prediction but the average of our writers" tips)
Last season's position 14th
Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker) 1,000-1
Until last week it looked like a case of new season, same old West Bromwich Albion: 2016-17 would be another campaign of comfort - or stagnation depending on how empty the glass is - under the ever-pragmatic Tony Pulis.
But then Jeremy Peace sold his 88% stake in the club to Guochuan Lai and Pulis, the archetypal safe pair of hands, was immediately made the bookmakers" favourite in the ever unpleasant market of first manager to be fired.
The landscape has undeniably altered in the Black Country - and not just at The Hawthorns, but a few miles north-west in Wolverhampton, too, where new Chinese owners wasted no time in relieving Kenny Jackett of his services.
Pulis, however, has been given reassurances by Lai that his job is not in immediate threat, and the entrepreneur has also stated his desire not to alter the club culture.
"I have no wish to change the club's ethos or embark on an unsustainable spending spree," he said upon taking over.
I want to be a good owner and to invest in this club for the long term.
First and foremost, our goal is to ensure that we remain in the Premier League and then beyond that, I would like to see the club establish itself in the top half of the division.
I believe it is the best league in the world and I want to take this club as far as possible.
Such is Pulis's record, the first aspect should not be too problematic.
The next aim is to break into the top half of the table, but it will be important for the new owner and an increasingly divided fanbase hoping for a quick shoot up the table to realise that is an increasingly onerous task because of the recent ground made up by other mid-table sides.
To progress from last season's 14th-place finish will certainly require more of an edge up front.
Only Aston Villa, tailed off at the bottom, scored fewer goals and it is worth recalling that at Christmas Albion were averaging fewer than a shot on target per 90 minutes, by some stretch the division's worst.
They failed to score in 13 of their 38 games and found the net more than once on only nine occasions.
Of their 10 victories, not one was by more than single goal and seven finished 1-0.
Predictably, a dozen of their sparse total of 34 came from set pieces.
Little wonder disgruntled reactions were common at The Hawthorns, perhaps most notably after a diabolical 0-0 draw with Villa in late January, when the visitors looked the more likely.
On the flip side, only the top six had better defensive records - though no other club could claim to regularly line up with four centre-halves.
Those defenders are often underappreciated, not least Jonny Evans, who is said to have Arsenal chasing him following their latest injury crisis.
The Northern Ireland international enjoyed a fine European Championship and it would take a hefty fee for Albion to sell.
Ben Foster is dependable in goal and they are well stocked in midfield.
Darren Fletcher, much like Evans, displayed plenty of evidence that he would still be capable of performing at a higher level at 32, and Claudio Yacob is underrated.
Irritatingly for all parties the long and winding tale of Saido Berahino's future remains unresolved.
Bids from Stoke and Crystal Palace were rejected under Peace's ownership but the former remain keen and Mark Hughes is happy to be patient.
After last season was close to a write-off, it makes sense for all concerned for a move to go through.
The striker is undoubtedly talented but with, as Pulis mentioned more than once, people dragging him one way and pulling him the other it has long been evident the relationship is unworkable.
Albion are insistent upon signing a replacement before letting the former England Under-21 international go but their £15m move for Diafra Sakho broke down days before the takeover, with the club stating he had passed his medical and everything was agreed but he had a back injury that would have meant missing the start of the season.
It places a lot of pressure on the Venezuelan Salomón Rondón, who showed brief flashes of promise last season but needs to improve on his return of nine goals, especially if Rickie Lambert continues to be as ineffective.
The decision to release Victor Anichebe and Stéphane Sessègnon also looks odd in retrospect.
Pulis has been notoriously slow to promote young players throughout his career and the sight of three teenagers - Jonathan Leko, Sam Field and Tyler Roberts - in the final game of last season, a 1-1 draw with Liverpool, is unlikely to become the norm.
He will return to the tried and tested but Leko is worth keeping an eye on.
The 17-year-old attacking midfielder made five appearances in total last season, becoming the first player born in 1999 to appear in the Premier League, and is also highly rated in the England underage system.
Matt Phillips, a £5.5m signing from Queens Park Rangers, will provide pace but he is the sole new player entering the opening weekend of the campaign.
It is not wild to suggest the end of the window could be a hectic one.
"All over," Pulis told the Express and Star last month about where needs to be strengthened.
Every position that you look at.
The back players, midfield players and front players, we have to strengthen.
The targets have been there, we know what we want.
Getting them is proving more difficult than envisaged, mostly due to uncertainty during the takeover process.
The season could be defined by how they start, with seven eminently winnable games before a daunting run of Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
By that point the pressure on Pulis will have eased or become insurmountable.
And, who knows, maybe even Berahino will have found a new club.
Tata Steel UK rescue deal closer after trustees back pension changes
The pension trustees behind Tata Steel UK have said the scheme can be restructured without entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), boosting the prospects of a rescue deal for the company.
The British Steel Pension Scheme has liabilities of £15bn and a deficit of as much as £700m by some measures, making it a serious obstacle for a rescue deal for Tata Steel UK and the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly confident about securing the future of its UK business, which employs 11,000 people, after talks with the business secretary and the Pensions Regulator.
The company plans to merge its European operations, including the UK business, with those of ThyssenKrupp, the German conglomerate.
However, the deal is conditional on the British Steel Pension Scheme being restructured and the government providing financial support.
Allan Johnston, chair of the pension trustees, said the scheme could avoid falling into the PPF if the benefits for workers were modified.
Although it is well-funded compared with other schemes, with the deficit narrowing to £300m on some measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp are keen to keep its liabilities under control.
Johnston said the trustees accepted it "would not be realistic" for the joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel UK to take on responsibility for funding the current and future deficit.
Modifying the benefits of the scheme was a more attractive option than it entering the PPF, he added, where workers would have to accept reduced terms.
Tata Steel sources have warned it could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of the steelworks since talks began about the future of its UK business in March, and this has been used as a bargaining chip in talks with the British government.
Koushik Chatterjee, executive director of Tata Steel Europe, said the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business "more sustainable."
Speaking at the sidelines of Tata Steel's annual meeting in India, Chatterjee said talks to restructure the pension scheme were progressing, but he insisted the scheme is well-funded.
"We are discussing with various stakeholders, including the British government and other stakeholders like the government of Wales and so on," Chatterjee said, according to the Times of India.
There is a recognition that pension has a certain impact in a commodity business like steel, so we have to find a structural solution, which does not impact the business going forward.
The pension trustees" willingness to cooperate in talks to restructure the scheme will be welcomed by Tata Steel.
The potential changes to the scheme include shifting how the annual inflation-based increase in benefits is measured from the retail price index to the lower consumer price index, as well as limiting future increases in pension payments to the minimum required by law.
Johnston added: "The trustee and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and the Pensions Regulator with compelling evidence of the scheme's ability to pay modified benefits indefinitely and on a low-risk basis outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the scheme's funding position has not been affected by recent falls in gilt yields in the same way as many other UK pension schemes, and we remain confident of the scheme's ability to provide modified benefits as proposed on a self-sufficient basis.

A parent was held in administrative detention for beating a school bus driver after his child missed the bus for being two minutes late
The parent of a student insulted the school bus driver and the teacher on the bus and beat the driver out of impulse after his child missed the school bus for being two minutes late.
The driver felt that he was wronged and called the police. The Ezhou police placed the parent with alleged beating behavior under administrative detention.
Mr. Xiao is a school bus driver of a kindergarten in Wutonghu New Area of Liangzihu District, Ezhou City, Hubei Province. At about 8:00am on August 7, Xiao drove the bus to pick up children in a village in the new area.
"The rain is so heavy today, and we're two minutes late. Can't you wait us for a moment? Why do you drive off? You're so irresponsible!"
Mr. Gong met teacher Zhang after getting off the bus and came into conflicts with her again, leaving an unhappy end.
Mr. Xiao's hands bled and his head was scratched by an umbrella. He also showed symptom of headache.
"I'm only a driver and will drive according to the prescribed time and route, and it is not my fault to drop Xiaoming."
Mr. Xiao felt that he was wronged and reported the incident to the school bus company he belongs to. After discussion with leaders of the company, he decided to call the police.
Due to pressure from the police, Mr. Gong surrendered himself to the Wutonghu police station of the Liangzihu branch of the Ezhou Municipal Public Security Bureau on August 10.
Meanwhile, dens and stores involving production, marketing, repair, modification and assembly of motorcycles and electric bikes will be eliminated.
It's noteworthy that the police will place riders of motorcycles and electric bikes who gather at bus stations, subway entrances and other public places to wait for, pick up and attract passengers under administrative detention without exception on charges of disturbing order at public places.
The custody business had achieved an average annual growth rate of 52.89% in the past six years, covering fund, insurance, trust, bank financial management, pension, cross-border investment, social welfare, transaction payment and many other sectors.
Huang Runzhong, head of the Secretariat of the China Banking Association, said asset custody has become an important link connecting the money market, capital market and real economy. It is also an important institutional arrangement to guarantee financial security.
Along with rapid development of China's direct financing market and wealth management market, the asset custody market has played an increasingly important role.
Data from the report on development of China's asset custody industry in 2016 showed that the ratio of assets under custody to deposits reached 62.74% at the end of 2015, versus 17.11% at the end of 2011.
The ratio of assets under custody to total deposits of financial institutions is often used to measure the status and function of the custody sector.
It's noteworthy that China's asset custody mechanism is defective presently. Many sectors have failed to strictly enforce the custody mechanism, or even failed to be placed under custody.
The absence of asset custody mechanism is one of the major reasons to explain the outbreak of risk events in P2P online lending, private equity funds and other sectors.
The report proposed to realize the "complete custody" model, which covers the entire institution and features all assets and complete processes, in a push to better guarantee financial security and maintain investors' interests.
Currently all P2P platforms will draw huge amounts of loan loss provisions, the value-added tax of which is not deductable as assets after the reform of replacing business tax with VAT.
Shenzhen recently held a special training on finance and tax for the Internet finance industry, with finance and tax experts offering suggestions to the city's Internet finance enterprises.
The numerous problems faced by the city's Internet finance enterprises in finance and tax were thrust into the spotlight during the training session, which was hosted by the Shenzhen Internet Finance Association and co-organized by the Shenzhen Certified Tax Agents Association.
"As cases of absconding with funds occur frequently in the industry, P2P platforms' drawing of hue loan loss provisions has undoubtedly become an important means to stabilize investors' confidence."
Hu Mianpeng, President of the Shenzhen Junhexin Finance and Tax Service Agency, said that if enterprises don't pay the loan loss provisions they have drawn, they need to pay a considerable amount of added-value tax.
"But if P2P platforms negotiate with insurance enterprises to purchase the specific product launched by the latter, it could be used for VAT deduction, and then the enterprises' costs will be reduced."
Hu advised that the Shenzhen Internet Finance Association could negotiate with insurers to make a forward-looking attempt in the pilot city of the Internet finance program.
Something new has been seen in the Chinese A-share market presently - the stock index bounced back to 3,000 points amid a widespread bearish sentiment. Behind this, retail investors' sentiment remained subdued, while foreign investors have increased their holdings of A shares for seven consecutive months.
"I'm less confident in the stock market above 3,000 points, and feel jittery about the expansion of new share issue", elder stock investor Mr Chen told journalists of Wuhan Evening News.
Core changes of the market become the lingering volatilities surrounding the A-share market after the abnormal fluctuations in 2015, with many issues pending. Money supply in the market remained weak, making it very hard to earn money.
An Everbright Securities report indicated that as a whole, the investment sentiment remained subdued in July, with new funds from individuals being on the decrease.
The decrease of transaction settlement fund balance in the securities market in July was smaller than that in June, while the net bank-securities transfers stood at negative RMB 66.6 billion.
As for the number of new investors, there were about 310,000 new investors each week in July, which still stayed at a low level.
Northbound Trading Link (NTL), which has seen continuous net inflow of foreign capital, recorded a net capital inflow of RMB 8.7 billion in July, higher than the previous month.
Foreign investors' increased holding of A shares also implies the growing attraction of the current A-share market.
For retail investors, the Shanghai Composite Index fared well thanks to the continuous inflow of funds to the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect for a long time.
There are a few changes deserving attention in terms of operation: 1) changes expected to be brought by launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect; 2) the catalysis effect arising from announcement of interim reports and third-quarter reports.
Currently Singapore has become the city's third largest overseas destination for cross-border RMB settlement, second only to Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Implementation of these pilot policies has created a good financial service environment for construction of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) strategic interconnection demonstration project and promoting inland area opening-up and development.
As the application situation changes every year, the settlement threshold and scale are likely to vary from the previous year.
The administrative measures also stipulated that under the rating-based settlement publicity mechanism, applicants who have got the qualified rating need to make publicity before settlement.
Units and individuals who falsify in the process of policy implementation will be disqualified for application in the same year and the next five years, and the settlement will be cancelled as well.
When the public security organ investigated the case, four relevant parties, namely, two former cooperation companies, the chairman of one of the two companies and the jointly-established hotel company, signed an "agreement" over problems in the case.
During performance of the agreement, the two parties brought each other to court again, petitioning the court to affirm invalidity of the "agreement".
Recently, the People's Court of Hailar District, Hulunbeier City, Inner Mongolia, ruled on the case.
Inner Mongolia Hulunbeir Zhongwei Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. and Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing) Investment Co., Ltd. jointly developed a real estate project - Hulunbeir Shiji Tianlun Hotel.
Mr. Dong once acted as chairman and legal representative of the hotel company after its establishment with joint contributions by the two companies.
Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing) and Shiji Tianlun Hotel agreed that Mr. Dong would apply for withdrawing the case with the public security organ after performing the obligations prescribed in the agreement, and they will no longer hold Mr. Dong and other related personnel responsible for legal liabilities.
After Mr. Dong fully performs the agreement, Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing) and Shiji Tianlun Hotel will announce a waiver of rights to hold Zhongwei Real Estate Development, Mr. Dong and other related persons liable for criminal and civil responsibilities.
According to the "agreement" signed on April 24, 2014, the four parties agreed to reach an agreement over fund embezzlement and appropriation by Mr. Dong and his subordinate staff.
The agreement mainly prescribed the amount of funds Mr. Dong should return and the return time as well as the equity transfer and legal representative change of Shiji Tianlun Hotel Company.
In October 2015, Zhongwei Real Estate Development and Mr. Dong, two parties of the agreement, brought the other two parties, namely, Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing) and Shiji Tianlun Hotel Company, to court.
The defendants replied that the public security organ's judicial audit came to the conclusion that Mr. Dong and the accountant embezzled and appropriated over RMB 29 million of funds.
In February 2014, Mr. Dong got in touch with Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing), and the two parties signed the "agreement" after negotiations at the public security organ's meeting room.
Mr. Dong pleaded guilty, expressed confession and threw himself on the mercy of the court. He also returned the RMB 5 million of Shiji Tianlun Hotel Company.
The entrusted agent of the plaintiffs said Mr. Dong learned after consulting legal specialists that it was controversial whether or not the "borrowing" behavior could be criminalized.
The "agreement" was signed provided that Mr. Dong was convicted of the embezzlement crime, in contravention of the Twelfth Article of the Criminal Procedural Law.
Giving criminal sanctions and equity transfer fall into different legal scopes, and the duo can't be confused and traded. What's more, equities can't be used to exchange for "impunity". The "agreement" covers illegal purposes in legal forms.
The plaintiffs opined that it is the national public power of public security organ, procuratorate, court and other national legal authorities to give criminal sanctions, which is not bound by private appointments.
The agreement signed by the two parties on April 24, 2014 violates the compulsory provisions of the national laws and regulations and infringes the social and public interests.
Therefore, no matter whether Mr. Dong constitutes a crime, the agreement on "a waiver of rights to give criminal sanctions on the opposite side" has no legal effect.
The entrusted agent of the defendants deemed that the "agreement" is the civil understanding reached between criminal suspects and victims in the process of criminal proceedings.
The "agreement" is signed and performed to recover the victims' financial losses to the greatest extent and reduce the criminal punishment on criminal suspects, which are not illegal purposes nor contrary to compulsory provisions of laws and regulations.
It was Mr. Dong's real intention to sign the "agreement", which was legal and effective after being signed and sealed by all the parties concerned.
The defendants thought that the "crime of position encroachment" and the "crime of funds misappropriation" are public-prosecuted cases, and it should be decided by the public security organ whether or not the case should be withdrawn, rather than the reporter.
The agreement is just an appointment, under which the victims would apply with the public security organ for withdrawal of the case after Mr. Dong fulfilled the agreement, which is not in conflict with the exercise of national public power to give criminal sanctions.
Meanwhile, the court held that the liability for breach of contract is beyond the scope of ordinary civil agreements, and validity of the agreement should be reviewed in the process of criminal proceeding.
After receiving the alarm, the Yu County Government and the Yangquan Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately started formulating an emergency response plan and set up a command to clarify missions and jobs, expound work measures, fulfill job duties and make a comprehensive plan.
Currently the public security organ is still further investigating other alleged irregularities of the gang members.
The plaintiff deemed that there are multiple faults and mistakes in the two hospitals' diagnosis and treatment for the plaintiff. The plaintiff claimed a compensation of RMB 833,815 from the two hospitals and brought them to court.

James said that the USAF plans to raise the retention bonus of unmanned aerial vehicle pilots from US$25,000 each year to US$35,000.
What bothers the USAF is that airline companies offer generous remunerations to poach pilots.
James said that it is imperative for the government to raise bonuses for air force pilots as the airliners "are expected to recruit more pilots".
Both James and David Goldfein, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, want to improve the living quality of pilots.
Goldfein sighed that the shortage of pilots is a "crisis", and that "the U.S. is not naturally endowed with air dominance, but get it in battle."
Goldfein said although the current pilot shortage has not yet affected the country's operations in Iraq, Syria and Libya, these military operations have affected pilots' decisions to stay or leave.
There were some wrongdoings when the police carried out searches and arrests, including retaliatory law enforcement and connivance of police's irregularities against the law enforcement regulations.

At around 8:30pm, she slid from a two-storey-high inflatable chute, while a young woman was standing at the foot of the chute.
Xiao Han failed to elude and ran into the woman. She cried out that her left leg hurt so much, and was later sent to the rest room by workers.
Xiao Han was sent to a hospital after her mother Mrs. Wu arrived, and was diagnosed with tibial fracture on her left leg.
Mrs. Wu contacted the person in charge of the water park, who came to hospital later and gave RMB 800 sympathy money. The responsible person said that the park bears no responsibility for the incident, which was unacceptable to her.
A reporter from Chutian Metropolis Daily visited the water park, and Mr. Lin, who was responsible for dealing with the incident, said he was on duty at the time of the accident.
According to his investigation, the security guard found no abnormalities on the slide at the time of the accident when Xiao Han cried out that her foot hurt. The security guard immediately helped her walk out of the pool and brought her Yunnan Baiyao.
Mr. Lin said Xiao Han told the security guard that her foot was sprained two days ago, and he didn't know how she had bone fracture.
The park stipulated that minors should enter the park with company of adult guardians, who should be fully responsible for the minors' safety.
The park shall not be held responsible for any safety accidents that took place due to personal reasons or poor care of the guardian, and a related notice was posted inside the park.

Both the competent department and the initiating enterprises didn't give any details of the preparation scheme, including whether it differs from what's indicated in the notice.
The notice once indicated that the setup of Lanhai Bank should be filed with the CBRC for approval, and there may be adjustments in the process of application, examination and approval, which leads to uncertainties and risks.

Reporters of Dahe Daily learned yesterday from the planetarium of the Henan Province women and children's activities center that the Perseids will reach its maximum from 9:00pm tonight to 1:30am on August 13 this year.
According to introduction of Li Defan, director of the planetarium, due to impact of gravitation from Jupiter, the peak flow of the Perseids will be higher than that of the previous years, which is expected to reach 150 meteors per hour.
Perseids is one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, and is most suitable for observation.

The drainage system of the Forbidden City has been precisely measured, designed and constructed when it was built.
Ground of the Forbidden City complies with characteristics of the geographical conditions in Beijing, appearing higher in the north and lower in the south while higher in the middle and lower on both sides. In addition, it is on a little down slope.
The elevation of the Gate of Divine Prowess to the north and the Meridian Gate to the south stands at 46.05 meters and 44.28 meters, respectively, generating a difference of about two meters in ground height. This slope has created advantages for natural drainage so that the ponding could drain slowly.
The Forbidden City's drainage system is very huge. The reserved ancient rain gutter measures more than 15 kilometers in length, while the subdrain is as long as nearly 13 kilometers.
All draining canals inside the Forbidden City lead to the Inner Golden Water River, which connects with a 52-meter-wide moat outside the Forbidden City, and is linked to the Outer Golden Water River and other water systems in Zhongnanhai.
Staff of the Forbidden City have replaced the damaged components in time in the overhauls and checks in a bid to guarantee a smooth drainage in rainy days.

In addition, as for co-launch of the Shanghai-Taipei City Forum, Chiu said urban communications and benign interactions across the Straits could help enhance understanding, and boost development of urban economy, education, culture and tourism.
The Mainland Affairs Council will keep a close eye on development of the communication, strengthen contacts with local governments and provide necessary assistance.
The reporter learned from China Railway that the bridge of the Beijing-Shenyang high speed railway across the Changchun-Shenzhen Expressway had a successful closure on August 12.
The Beijing-Shenyang high speed railway across the Changchun-Shenzhen Expressway is as long as 760 meters, and features complicated construction technology and high technical requirements. It is a dominant project of Liaoning section of the Beijing-Shenyang high speed railway.
All construction units and the vast railway builders have carried out construction in a scientific and innovative manner since the project was commenced in July 2014, ensuring the project to proceed safely and smoothly.
Closure of the bridge has laid a solid foundation for construction of the Beijing-Shenyang high speed railway to progress smoothly.
The Beijing-Shenyang high speed railway extends from the railway terminal in Beijing, and passes Chengde in Hebei Province as well as Chaoyang and Fuxin in Liaoning Province. It measures 698 kilometers in length.
"Even though there is a more than four-meter drop between the river and the bridge, water will flow over the bridge in the case of flash floods."
Jin Mingsheng, Deputy Town Chief of Luoerling Town, Huoshan County, made the remark while gesturing by the Xiangshui River on August 10.
"In the flood more than one month ago, the dam on one side of the river collapsed, with massive stones and washings rolling into the river.
We're now planning to infill the dam with cement, and the flood prevention bank will be solid enough to withstand the worst flooding in 50 years."
"Workers are moulding, and the project can be basically completed in another month", said Jin Mingsheng.
"Take this flood prevention bank for example, the dam may collapse at any moment when flood hits, and the flood would rush into houses of residents living along the bank. Now we use cement to infill a solid dam so that we could transfer residents along the bank with ease in the case of flooding in a bid to reduce property losses."
One of my hobbies is to buy, appreciate and collect books, and the collection of the initial issues of magazines is a growing special category in my study room.
Comrade Deng Xiaoping made the South Inspection Speech in the spring of 1992, pushing the new round of reform and opening-up to carry out in full swing in the country, and the cover of this magazine has well reflected the historical background of the year.
In the upper part of the cover, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is seen leaning forward to make strategic planning for the reform and opening-up campaign, highlighting his determination and last-ditch demeanor as a great man.
Beneath the cover, it is the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, which was under construction against the rising sun, and citizens are seen hustling for their work.
What I collect is the initial issues of magazines published during the country's two times of publication resumption after its founding. They reflect that Chinese workers are always in the forefront of the times, contribute to social development and lead progress of the times.
Data showed that currently Shennongjia receives around 700,000 visitors each year, while professional statistical analysis found that it is inadvisable for Shennongjia to receive more than 800,000 visitors each year, which may damage resources and environment of the scenic spot.
It is predicted that the number of visitors from home and abroad to Shennongjia will surge after it is inscribed to the World Heritage List, while Shennongjia made an early warning against the visitor number rather than blindly pursuing growth in the tourist number and income, which is laudable.
It is a necessary measure to protect the ecological environment of Shennongjia, and also a sustainable tourism road to realize the harmony between man and nature as well as man and resources in scenic spots.
After being made World Heritage, Shennongjia has become the first heritage site in China and the second across the world to obtain three major honors, namely, the World Heritage, the Man and Biosphere Reserve and the World Geopark.
In addition, Shennongjia forms the watershed between the Yangtze River and the Han River, and covers a total of four water systems, namely, Xiangxi River, Yandu River, Nanhe River and Duhe River.
The proverb that "Mountain foot and top always see different seasons - midsummer against spring or autumn against winter, with the four seasons being difficult to distinguish" has highlighted the unique and typical climatic features of Shennongjia.
Thereout, Shennongjia's practice of promoting sustainable tourism to protect ecological environment rather than pursuing overexploitation is worth learning and referring to by other World Heritage scenic spots.
Shennongjia stands out as the 50th World Heritage of our country, and China has become the second biggest country in terms of the number of World Heritage it secures. We shall strive to make the 50 World Heritages glow and pass them on to the future generations.
For the time being, many heritage sites have been found "taking the application seriously but making light of preservation and protection, taking the exploitation seriously but making light of management", turning the World Heritage into a cash cow.
Obviously, if the application for World Heritage is viewed from the economic perspective, a heritage will be taken as a "golden bowl", while its future will look grim no matter how good it is now.
There are many past experiences to learn from at home and abroad; for instance, six World Heritage sites in China received yellow card warning at the Session of the World Heritage Committee held in 2010 mainly due to the change of ecological environment after overexploitation.
Tang Jiagui, deputy chief of the animal management department at Chongqing Zoo, told the reporter that if a female panda gives birth to twins in the wild, it would usually choose to feed the stronger one but neglect or turn down the weaker one.

Ramos also joked that even though it was not an ice-breaking visit to Hong Kong, it could bring a turnaround to the Sino-Philippines relations.
Ramos: Former Interior and Local Government Secretary Alunan said that this visit to Hong Kong was originally for the purpose of ice breaking, but it seemed that there was no ice to break in the summer in Hong Kong.
As for time of the next meeting, Ramos said it will be decided by the President Duterte as well as development of the situation. It will be held in September at the soonest, but the candidates have not been nailed down yet.

The main urban area of Kunming saw several times of single-point heavy rainfall in early August, and the average rainfall stood at 82mm in the city, 48% higher than the same period in the past.
Yet, throughout the year, the average rainfall of Kunming by early August was still slightly smaller than that of the previous years.
At around 4:30pm on yesterday (August 11), a total of 39 regions in Yunnan received early warnings against meteorological disasters, and most of them were yellow warnings against thunderbolt.
The rainfall sustained across much of Yunnan, while some regions had thunderstorm, short-time strong rainfall, hail, gale and other severe convective weather.
Rainfall in the main urban area of Kunming decreased compared to the day before yesterday, and was not strong. The weather got warmer.
According to forecasts of the provincial meteorological observatory, the showery weather will sustain in Kunming in the coming three days, while the temperature will basically remain unchanged at between 17℃ and 26℃.
The municipal government approved it recently, requiring all related districts and counties as well as units to implement it to fully guarantee the life and property security of people along the river.
The "Chinese style of crossing roads" can be seen everywhere for a long time, and people have become accustomed to the phenomenon that pedestrians jaywalk and climb over railings recklessly.
The traffic police department will start capturing such traffic irregularities with the help of e-police from next Monday (August 15).
The e-police will take a total of three pictures of the pedestrian who touches the virtual induction coil, and the information will be entered into the "Road traffic offense system" after being reviewed and verified by man to penalize the two above-mentioned irregularities.
It is only when all traffic participants abide by the traffic laws and regulations that the urban traffic order problem could be fundamentally addressed.
The U.S. plans to test the THAAD system in 2017 over claim to intercept DPRK's missiles
ITAR-TASS quoted James Syring as saying that they had tested the Air Defense Advanced Mobile System (ADAMS) of the U.S. for intercepting short- and medium-range missiles in a few years.
"The system has passed all these tests, and now we plan to test the long-distance effect of these weapons."
As for the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) antimissile system by the U.S. in South Korea, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition.
We requested the U.S. and South Korea to immediately stop deploying the THAAD antimissile system, never take actions to lead to complicated regional situation and never do things detrimental to China's strategic security interests.
Windows of three neighbors were broken, and two great-grandmothers who came to dissuade him were pushed to the ground.
Recently this furious man was brought under control by police of the Nancheng police station in Anlu City in a timely manner.
After receiving report, police of the Nancheng police station in Anlu City took decisive measures to subdue Xiao Ming to prevent him from hurting the innocent.
Police investigations showed that Xiao Ming's parents have all been aged above 60, and the family rarely dealt with others, and thus the possibility of being induced by others to go whoring could be eliminated.
The police found through investigations that Xiao Ming was overly elated, and what he said and did was different from ordinary people. They learned after inquiring his family members that Xiao Ming has become indoorsy since one year ago, refusing to contact or communicate with others.
Police suspected that Xiao Ming's abnormal behaviors were due to mental disturbance caused by his long-term staying at home. Anlu mental health center diagnosed that Xiao Ming had developed mental disease.
Currently Xiao Ming has been sent by the related departments to the mental health center to receive free treatment.
The latest statistical data from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) showed that Germany had received a total of 240,000 refugees in the first seven months of this year, a sharp decrease from the number expected.
A large number of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa flooded into Germany in 2015, and more than 1 million refugees were registered in Germany in the year.
On August 11, WirtschaftsWoche quoted Weise, head of the BAMF, as saying that only 240,000 refugees have entered Germany year to date, far smaller than expectation.
Despite the drop in the number of refugees flooding into Germany, the BAMF still has an arduous task. Currently there are still around 500,000 asylum applications left unprocessed.
Even so, an increasing number of refugees have filed lawsuits against the BAMF, and some of the asylum applicants have waited for more than two years.
By the end of 2015, nearly 2,300 cases against "nonfeasance" of the BAMF had been filed.
Bank of Russia said that the growth was mainly attributable to reassessment of the market expectation on the country's economy.
The international reserves of Russia include foreign exchange reserves, gold reserves as well as the reserve positions and special drawing rights (SDRs) in the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The international reserves of Russia are jointly controlled by the Russian government and the central bank of Russia, and are mainly used for dealing with economic risks.
The international reserves of Russia have been on the decline in recent years amid the downward economic pressure faced by the country due to the Western sanctions against Russia, coupling with the dropping international oil prices.
Hollywood blockbusters, which are well made, star-studded and hyped, have been featured in the film market in recent years. It seemed that all people are discussing them, and go to cinema to watch them together.
Then is it truly as we thought that blockbusters always rock the cinema and make a bundle of money?
Undoubtedly, the production costs of Hollywood blockbusters have been surging year by year, and the growth is even far beyond that of the inflation rate.
Data from Chart 1 showed that the number of Hollywood films, which were produced during the decade from 1995 to 2004 and cost over US$100 million, totaled 60.
While the figure surged to 197 during the 11 years from 2005 to 2015.
The sharp increase in film production number indicates a rising production cost on average, which has aroused alert of the industry.
Famous directors Spielberg and Lucas once criticized such phenomenon in a forum activity, saying that if this continues, the industry would "implode".
Among these 29 films, the highest proportion of marketing costs to total costs stood at 40%, while the lowest even reached as high as 24%.
The average costs of physical copy, production of audio and video products and transport reached US$67.8 million for each film.
It is very important to make a correct estimation of the number of copies and audio and video products to be made, especially in the DVD market that adopts the marketing policy of accepting goods return.
In 2005, DreamWorks made 5 million DVD copies of Shrek 2 but found a poor sales market, which made the company fail to realize its income target of the quarter as a result.
An average amount of US$36.6 million needed to be taken out from these 29 films for revenue sharing and compensation among directors, producers, scriptwriters, protagonists as well as other cast and crew.
For Hollywood studios, the revenue sharing mechanism could help them reduce financial pressure in the early stage, while it turns out to be an incentive for the cast and crew.
Among these 29 films, profitable ones shared 9% of income on average and one even shared as much as 18%, while films that suffered losses also shared around 5% of income on average.
It is noteworthy that the cast and crew would ask for share the "revenue" rather than the "profit".
Under operation of the tricky accounting system of Hollywood, some films that could have made a bundle may eventually turn out to be in the red.
For instance, a report revealed about Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in 2010 indicated that Warner still claimed two years after distribution of the film that it lost US$167 million in the film, making profit sharing an empty talk.
Hollywood also needs to pay a certain amount of bonus to the union formed by various working staff, while these 29 films paid an average of US$11.76 million for that.
In addition, the operating costs of Hollywood Pictures would also be shared by films, while these 29 films shared an average of US$14.83 million.
After deducting the sales tax and gains shared by cinemas, the film company could receive 53% box office sales of the North America and 41% of the world, amounting to around US$169 million.
After an average marketing expense of US$98 million for distribution was deducted, there was only around US$70 million left.
These 29 films each generated an average income of US$134.3 million from distribution of home audio and video products.
After deducting the average marketing expense of US$21.9 million and production cost of US$30.5 million, the net income stood at US$81.9 million on average, which topped the income list. Its profit rate was much higher than that of theatrical distribution.
Paid TV channels created US$14.6 million of income on average for these films, a little bit more than the US$13.3 million created by free-to-air channels.
Among these 29 films, about half generated less than 1% of income from video on demand (VOD), and even films released after 2011 only generated 4.1% of income from this business.
Hollywood still took a relatively conservative attitude toward VOD when building the distribution system of these blockbusters.
As for derivative development, these 29 films generated an average income of US$11.5 million by authorizing derivative development.
Yet, almost two thirds of the derivative development income came from the top two super blockbusters, and only one third of them earned more than US$1 million from this.
Apart from the sources of income mentioned above, these Hollywood blockbusters still had bits of income from aircraft broadcast and music, which averaged at US$2.7 million at most for each film.
Surprisingly, Stephen's statistics showed that these 29 Hollywood blockbusters generated US$14.8 million of profits on average, while the profit rate only reached 3.7%.
If the long revenue recovery process is taken into account, this profit rate could hardly beat the inflation.
Films with costs in the lowest range between US$100 million and US$125 million delivered the worst performance in profitability, and only one third of them earned money.
However, three quarters of the films with costs in the highest range of above US$200 million made profits.
Core prompt: In 2014, Durant renewed his seven-year US$60 million contract with Nike by signing a ten-year contract worth US$300 million.

Japanese media said that Japan's foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, left for the Philippines to pay a visit on August 11 and held talks with Rodrigo Duterte, president of the country, to strengthen bilateral cooperation.
Both Japan and the US are eager to keep close touch with the Philippines in the fields including economic cooperation with the intention to prevent the Philippines from swinging to China.
According to the report of the website affiliated to Nihon Keizai Shimbun on Aug.11, Kishida will hold talks with Duterte and Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Perfecto Yasay, in Davao, a city in the south of the Philippines. This is the first talk held between a cabinet member of Japan and Duterte.
Kishida specially went to Davao City, base of Duterte, instead of Manila, the capital, so as to hope to confirm cooperative relationship with the Philippines on the issue of the South China Sea.
Kerry, on the second day after participating in a relevant conference of the ASEAN held in Laos in late July, met with Duterte in Manila. Both sides reached a consensus on the issue of respecting the arbitration ruling on the South China Sea.
Duterte told Kerry that "the arbitration ruling will constitute the base when any negotiation is conducted."
Kerry indicated at that time that $32 million would be offered to the government of the Philippines as assistance. It is probable that for the second time, Kishida will express the intention to offer assistance to the construction of the North-South commuter rail in Manila during the talks on August 11.
According to the report, the reason why both Japan and the US are eager to keep close touch with Duterte is that the Philippines is intensifying its effort to enhance the bilateral negotiation with China.
The US and Japan have been strengthening their cooperation with the Philippines. In 2014, the US and the Philippines signed a new military agreement, which, in fact, again permitted the American troops to station in the Philippines 25 years later, the report said.
Huang Xingguo and his party came to the environmental monitoring site at the scene of August 12 Accident to conduct an on-site observation of the surrounding environment and understand the monitoring data.
Since September 5 last year, particular pollutants in the air have not been detected and sea water quality has reached the national first-class sea water standard. Soil sampling test results indicate that there is no prominent difference in comparison with environmental background value.
Since March this year, monitoring has been conducted weekly. The monitoring results show that the environmental quality is safe and controllable, which is sufficiently affirmed by the experts from the Ministry of Environmental Protection who came to Tianjin to inspect the work.
The men's single gold medal of the table tennis at the Rio Olympics has made Ma Long realize the grand slam of his personal career.

On August 10, president of the Philippines, Duterte again criticized Goldberg, US ambassador to the Philippines, for interfering in the internal affairs of the Philippines.
In this April, during the presidential campaign in the Philippines, on the pretext of the issue of human rights, Goldberg found fault with Duterte. Both sides continuously elucidated their own viewpoints and the speech conflict was intense.
Duterte expressed his strong dissatisfaction with Goldberg's interference in the presidential election and even threatened to sever the relationship with the US after he is elected as president.
On the 5th day of the month, Duterte raked up old stories and again expressed his dissatisfaction with Goldberg, criticizing the latter for interfering in the internal affairs of his country.
A press spokesman of the president of the Philippines once said that the president did not forget the suffering brought about by US-led Western colonists.
At the end of July, when US Secretary of State Kerry visited the Philippines, the masses gathered outside the US Embassy to the Philippines and held a mass rally. Carrying placards, they demanded that "American troops go away from the Philippines".
With a splendid civilization and numerous people, China stood at the forefront of the world development for several centuries. Now the country has become the second largest economy in the world.
Speaking of the word, we realize that it not only implies too much meaning but also carries rich contents.
Without doubt, the proposition of setting up cultural self-confidence is based on the sufficient identification of their own culture value as well as the firm confidence in its vitality on the part of the CPC and the Chinese people.
Many people have realized that in Xi Jinping's series of talks, articles, speeches and interviews, famous quotations from ancient Chinese books and records as well as classics are found everywhere, manifesting highly cultural self-confidence and arousing the widespread resonance all over the world.
Facts have proved that along with the rise of contemporary China, the influence and attraction of the Chinese culture is increasingly being strengthened.
The Chinese modern history of over 100 years has already told us that all the road, theory and system are rooted in the culture.
Of course, for a time, we learned from Western countries about their implements, systems and cultures and kept rethinking in this process.
After a long-term exploration, we have found that the firm confidence in China's modernization derives from the "spiritual gene" of the Chinese nation.
In Xi Jinping's speeches and investigations, the discussions on excellent traditional Chinese culture including Confucianism are beyond count.
In the 18th collective study of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, Xi Jinping all the more emphasized that China's today is just the development of her yesterday and the day before yesterday.
He also said that for several thousand years, the Chinese nation has taken her civilization development path different from those of other countries and nations.
We have not occasionally blazed the socialist road with Chinese characteristics, which is determined by the historical inheritance and cultural tradition of our country.
In 2010, China's GDP stood second in the world. However, China' achievements are more than economy.
Since the Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China has attached more prominent importance to the construction of a powerful socialist cultural country, dedicated to initiating a new "golden age" of cultural development.
Either excellent traditional culture, revolutionary culture or advanced socialist culture is demonstrating unprecedented vitality.
In spite of the fact that the Chinese culture is time-honored and has vigorous development momentum, it cannot be denied that its current influence and function are far from reaching its due height.
Though China has experienced a lost time in the past few hundred years, yet now she has returned to the world stage in a more powerful manner.
While accepting a reporter's interview, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek bluntly said that the Chinese culture has made a lot of contributions to the world.
Just as Simsek said, today's China is making contributions to the world in a brand-new way.
Recently, the Jiangning area has witnessed a new round of real estate price rise. In the latter half of the year, several developers of purely new commercial residential buildings entered the market for the first time, intending to charge the high price of 30,000 yuan per square meter.
And the initial average price of Country Garden Century City adjacent to Jiangning is 7,088 yuan per square meter. At present, the commercial houses in the first phase have been sold out.
In transportation, at present, the Jiangning area boasts Metro Line 1, Metro Line 3 and Arport Line S1.
Up to now, Country Garden Century City has accommodated scheduled buses to Xiaolongwan Metro Station and Pharmaceutical University Metro Station for proprietors. In the later phase, with the increase of proprietors who will live in the buildings, the number of scheduled buses to metro stations will be increased.
In addition, Country Garden Century City has the transportation facilities such as double high-speed rails and Lukou Airport.
In business, Jiangning is divided into seven business areas, such as Dongshan, Jiulong Lake, Baijia Lake, University Town, Sanshan, Chalukou and Heding Bridge, which are not far away from Country Garden Century City.
Outlets in the eastern suburbs has an integrated planning area of 400, 000 square meters, planning to permit over 240 international fashion brands to be stationed. At present, over 100 such brands have entered there.
Outlets in the eastern suburbs of Nanjing is jointly run and managed by The TOC Company with the top-notch development management experience of Outlets and The Outlets Development Company, which copies American Outlets in one-to-one proportion. Thousands of customers come here for shopping weekly.
At present, the houses in the initial phase of Century City have been sold out. People are eagerly queuing up in lines for purchasing new delicately-decorated houses with housing area of 80 to 265 ㎡ each. Only 300 customers in the city can enjoy the extra 2% discount. Early registration means early selection of houses.
Another thing worth attention is that the range of the preferential railway tickets for college freshmen is between their homes and their universities. Otherwise, they cannot enjoy the preferential policy.
At the same time, a freshman, on the strength of his or her letter of admission, can only purchase a student ticket once. Those who have bought their tickets had better choose to alter the tickets if their journeys change instead of returning their tickets directly.
If they really need to return their tickets and ask for refunds, they can ask staff members to indicate that the tickets have been returned so as to ensure to purchase student tickets again.
Only a college entrant himself or herself can purchase a preferential railway ticket via his or her letter of admission. Other people accompanying him or her are not entitled to enjoy the discounted price.
"Though females are playing more and more social roles, quite a number of them lack the speech right equivalent to that of males in family and society at large."
The expert said that hence quite a number of females have the feelings of depression and anxiety to different degrees and the high-incidence age-bracket of such diseases is from 30 to 40.
Of course, in addition to the increase of the base number of patients, the increase of female patients stems from people's high attention to psychological health.
According to Xu Xiangdong, facing mental problems, many people in life adopt the attitude of "dogged resistance" or avoidance toward psychological pressure.
At the same time, due to the lack of understanding of depressive disorder and anxiety ailments, common citizens erroneously think that patients are in a fit of pique instead of giving them timely understanding and emotional support, which is also the main reason for a lower outpatient rate.
"Today, with people's getting a proper understanding of psychological health and paying attention to mental health, many patients and their family members can face the disease in a right manner."
Xu Xiangdong said that as a result, more and more patients are willing to enter hospitals to accept the help of professionals.
On August 11, local time, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a talk with his Ugandan counterpart in Kampala, capital of Uganda.
When jointly meeting the press with Kutesa after holding talks, Wang Yi indicated that whatever the international and regional vicissitudes, African countries have always been China's closest good brothers and China has always been the most reliable friend of African countries.
Of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, China is a country that has dispatched the largest number of peacekeepers to Africa. Now, over 2,400 Chinese peacekeepers are implementing peace-keeping missions in 7 African task areas including South Sudan and Mali.
In the past two years, the Chinese side has twice proposed to hold related conferences on the issue of South Sudan, actively supported the effort of the mediation by IGAD and put forth a China initiative for several times.
The Chinese side supports friendly African countries to strengthen the construction of the ability to maintain stable national defense. In addition, China has offered assistance to relevant African countries and regional organizations such as the AU through bilateral or multilateral channels, supporting their peace-keeping activities in Darfur, Somalia and other places.
China has actively taken part in the anti-piracy and escort operations conducted by the UN in the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somalia.
Since 2009, China has dispatched a total of 23 escort fleet and convoyed over 6,000 vessels to and fro.
China always supports and helps Africa to find solutions to problems by itself while some Western countries impose their schemes on Africa.
China maintains that eradicating poverty is the key to avoiding conflicts and crisis. Therefore, China is dedicated to strengthening friendly exchanges in Africa so as to help Africa to realize sustainable development in a real way.
Kutesa reiterated that on the issue of the reform of the Security Council, the Ugandan side firmly supports the Ezulwini Consensus, which is a common stance of the AU.
At the same time, the Chinese side also understands and supports Africa, advocating that priority should be given to rectify the historical injustice African countries have suffered.
After returning to the local police station, the policeman first of all offered a bowl of mung bean soup to the old man and told the latter to drink it up for fear that he might suffer heatstroke due to being exposed to the scorching weather for a long time.
Afterwards, the policeman patiently talked with the old man. At last, he knew that the old man surnamed Chen is 86 years old, a villager of the village of Nanzhai, Xiazhang Town. Due to his old age, the old man was not sober enough so that he could not find his home as he was wandering.

At dusk on August 9, a group of scaffolders working in high-altitude environment were quietly sitting on the steps of Optical Valley Pedestrian Street to have a rest.
Also called daily-salary workers, the scaffolders employed by their boss received their salary on the site after completing their work that day.
The city with more and more high rises cannot do without the efforts made by the scaffolders. Their work, which seems to have no technical content, is very dangerous.
On the morning that day, wearing work clothes and safety helmets, with wrenches in their waists and bolt guns in their hands, they shuttled on the steel frame outside buildings.
While talking, Xiong Guoyin from Huangpi took out 1500 yuan, his three days' pay, saying that he was going to send the money to his wife.
It is known that each of the daily-salary workers can earn 300 yuan to 500 yuan a day according to his labor intensity.
An experienced scaffolder deals with about 120 steel tubes every day, each of which weighs 8 kg. In other words, each scaffolder does with steel pipes weighing as much as 1000 kg a day.
With the construction duration coming to an end, Master Wu who is over 50 years old was counting his money, saying that he could endure the hardship in order to let his family lead a better life. Speaking of his family, he chuckled.
Tomorrow morning, the Municipal Public Security Bureau will hold the activity of soliciting opinions from citizens on the improvement of the traffic environment on the square of the railway station.
However, as a window showcasing the image of Xi'an to the outside world, there are still a lot of unsatisfactory phenomena as far as the traffic environment around the railway station is concerned.
At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, the Municipal Public Security Bureau of Xi'an will solicit opinions from citizens and conduct on-site interactive communication with them.
The interested citizens who cannot conduct the on-site communication can dial the hot-line specially opened at the branch bureau of public security of the station.
Known as the sternest anti-corruption law in the history of the Republic of Korea, the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act will come into force next month. According to the law, the expenses per capita of a civil servant who accepts a banquet shall not exceed 30,000 Korea won (approximately RMB 181 yuan)
According to the report by Yonhap on August 10, this stipulation poses a challenge to many first-class Korean restaurants that were originally going to exclusively entertain political figures and senior civil servants.
Quite a number of restaurants have to adjust the standard of table money and promote more inexpensive set meals. Some restaurants have closed down or switched to other industries once and for all.
Many Korean restaurant bosses are worried about their future business because of the law, Yonhap reported.
In Insadong of Seoul, a restaurant which has been doing business since 1969 is often patronized by political figures, government officials, media reporters and merchants.
The boss of the restaurant told the reporter from Yonhap that for many years they have been proud of offering luxury food and private dining environment to customers.
In the past ten years, the restaurant has offered high-specification set meals. However, "in order to satisfy the upper limit of table money set by The Improper Solicitation and Graft Act, we will have to change the tradition of several decades, which is really a difficult decision."
"Charcoal Fire Barbecue Village" mainly offers beef barbecue. According to its general manager, the price of "Han-u" (Korean beef), a signature dish of the restaurant, is over 50,000 Korean won.
"We predict that from October on, the sales volume will greatly reduce so we are considering replacing Han-u in set meals with imported beef."
Located in Jongno district, Seoul, the restaurant which was well-known for the patronage by political VIPs such as former presidents Roh Tae-woo and Lee Myung-bak closed down last month.
The boss of the restaurant said that as partial Korean government departments have been moved to Sejong, the restaurant's volume of business has suffered a great shock. It is estimated that after the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act takes effect, the number of guests will be even smaller.
Before long, the restaurant will divert to engaging in Vietnam rice noodles and the per capita dining standard is around 10, 000 Korean Won (RMB 60 yuan).
According to the prediction of the Korean Catering Service Industry Association, in the first year after the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act is put into force, the income of hotel industry in S. Korea will reduce by 4.15 trillion Korean Won (RMB 25 billion yuan) year on year.
Facing the possible economic loss, South Korean President Park Geun-hye said at a cabinet conference on the 10th day that what is important is to reduce its negative effects as far as possible while sticking to the core part of the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act.
She said, "Once the law is put into force, the social transparency and fairness will be more or less improved and the efficiency in economy will increase, too. Therefore, the economic growth of S. Korea will speed up."
While driving vehicles in our daily life, we often go through tunnels, sometimes even super-long tunnels or tunnel groups. So, whether tunnels are safe is important to us.
Meanwhile, it is stipulated that no unit or individual shall destroy, damage, illegally occupy or take advantage of highway tunnels and their subsidiary facilities.
If traffic needs to be closed or a carriageway is occupied for a long time due to the maintenance project, except for emergency situation, the management and maintenance unit shall issue to the public the information of construction and traffic control together with the traffic police department 15 days ahead of time.
Many drivers have encountered the situation in which traffic jams took place in tunnels. Some drivers are accustomed to smoking cigarettes in a tunnel to kill time.
When a highway tunnel is experiencing traffic congestion in the form of vehicles queuing, the traffic police department should take measures such as preventing vehicles from entering, guiding and diverting the traffic according to specific situations and issue the information of traffic jam in a timely way.
When a traffic accident takes place, it is imperative to carry out traffic control immediately to keep secondary accidents from happening through measures such as patrol and propaganda.
The public security organ can designate the route and the time for vehicles loaded with dangerous chemicals to pass or prohibit such vehicles from passing according to the requirements of the safety protection of highway tunnels and the technical conditions of highway tunnels and issue the notice to the public.
According to chinanews.com on August 12, Sheng Laiyun, press spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics said today that the surveyed urban unemployment rate in Liaoning is higher than the national average level. Since its economy is experiencing adjustment, the interior pressure is rather big.
Today, the Information Office of the State Council held a press conference with regard to the operation of national economy in July 2016.
Judging from the over-all situation, since the international economy is under deep adjustment, its recovery is relatively slow, which will bring about a large pressure on China's import including the import of Liaoning province.
Domestically, as China is in the critical period of structural adjustment, the contradiction between the surplus of traditional industries and the inadequacy in the growth of market effective demand is rather acute and the throes caused by the adjustment of traditional industries are still being released.
Therefore, in this new round of adjustment, it is the price of the products of heavy and chemical industries that is undergoing the deepest adjustment, thus inevitably bringing downward pressure on the economy of Liaoning.
During the 12th Five-Year Plan, due to the development of urbanization and the expansion of the real estate, the development of infrastructure in Liaoning was sound and the base of its real estate was fairly high.
After entering the period of the 13th Five-Year Plan, since its original base number was high, in terms of data manifestation, this round of adjustment has much more been reduced than other region.
Sheng Laiyun summarized that the economic adjustment of Liaoning has its special economic reasons, including not only the influence of cyclical factors, but also that of structural factors and even that of base effect and that generally it is in the process of adjustment.
Sheng Laiyun also revealed that since its economy is being adjusted, the fact that the urban unemployment rate of Liaoning is higher than the national average level indicates that its interior pressure is rather big.
According to the observation of the data in the recent two months, there is an indication that the economy of Liaoning will be stabilized and the index reduction degree is becoming narrow.
We believe that through the joint efforts of all aspects, the economy in the northeastern region including Liaoning will display the vitality of the former old industrial base for the second time.
More than 20 Taiwan compatriots from the Taiwan Self-driving Travel Association started their self-driving tour in the city of Ningde, Fujian, on the early morning of August 12 to experience the natural landscape featuring "mountains, sea, rivers and islands" in the city.
Before departure, many Taiwan compatriots said to the reporter of the China News Service, "We are warmly looking forward to this self-driving travel."
In the journey lasting four days and three nights, Taiwan self-driving tour lovers will conduct a self-driving experience of scenic areas or spots such as Yangjia Stream and the beaches in Xiapu, the Taimu Mountain in Fuding and the Baishuiyang Geological Landscape in Pingnan.

Since the beginning of the second half year, the A-share market has rallied. However, recently the Shanghai Composite Index has fluctuated around 3000 points, indicating the decline in investors' risk appetite.
In the bond market, since June, due to the influence of multiple factors such as fundamentals and investor sentiment, the bond market has taken on a trend of improvement.

Secondly, since the second quarter, with the weakness of the American economy and the influence of Britain's exit from the EU, the Fed has begun to slow down the pace of raising interest rates.
The asset prices of emerging markets benefit from the loose expectation rally brought by the slow interest rate hikes of the Fed. It is better to actively grasp the investment opportunity of stock market and bond market under this environment.
But judging from a short-term perspective, the further downward movement of the long-term interest rate requires phased risk exposure and the downward movement of capital interest rate.
At the same time, it is also imperative to see that having experienced the big bull market of bonds for two years, the yield rate of the fixed income market this year is hard to reach the level two years ago and the fluctuation range will increase at the same time. So on the whole, yield curve takes on a flat feature.

The primary school districts of Rencheng District and Confucius High-tech Zone have been unveiled in recent days, making "school district homes" a hot topic among Jining residents again.
Especially, those who plan to buy homes in the near future attach more importance to the school districts of the real-estate projects they are in favor of, as well as the problem that where their kids will study in the future.
On the morning of August 11, a journalist of Qilu Evening News found in a survey conducted among some real estate projects in the urban area that the property consultants of those projects have learnt the division of the school districts and introduced it to their customers.
"Our community belongs to the school district of Yongfeng Street Primary School. It will be convenient for property owners to send their kids to the school."
A staff at the sales office of a real-estate project called "Taibai International" told the journalist that the staff of the office have learnt the division of the primary school districts of Rencheng District after it was unveiled and have actively publicized the information and explained to their customers.
Zhongyin Joyful City also made active preparations after the school districts of the High-tech Zone were unveiled.
"Our real-estate project belongs to the school district of the primary school of Chong Wen School and the first phase will be delivered at the end of this year."
In addition, some new real-estate projects in Jibei New Area have been included into some school districts as well. For instance, the school district of Jining Experimental Primary School's Renxing department has covered projects like Sino-German Park City, Dejian Graceful Home and Ruihu One.
Furthermore, Zhongyin Joyful City, Linghua Noble Garden, Jiuxi Swan Castle, Zuoan Lido, Oulong Shengyuan, Hailiang Mansion, all of which are located in Confucius High-tech Zone, have been covered by the school district of the primary school of Chong Wen School.

"In contrast with the relative concentration of residences in cities, the residences of Jining in the future are expected to be located all around the city and the traditional idea about school districts will be broken."
The marketing manager of a real-estate project said that in which school their kids will study in the future has become something of great concern to the people who plan to buy homes in the future.
Since its development in China, crowdfunding has shown a positive image to the public. Regions across China have started improving the environment around them through crowdfunding.
Not long ago, the parents in a residential quarter in Nan'an city launched a reading room for their kids through crowdfunding.
Because they wanted the kids to keep a good reading habit during the summer vacation, dropping cell phones and computers to return to the most original way in recreation and entertainment.
Such a reading room with love not only fostered children's reading habits, but also offered them a good place to go during the summer vacation.
In addition to reading rooms, crowdfunding has also brought some warmth to left-behind children, a grave problem facing China now.
Reportedly, there are more than 3,000 left-behind children in central and western Huangyan, most of whom are living with their elderly grandparents at home. Their parents have to work in other regions to earn money. Therefore, they may only see their parents once a year.
The lack of kinship and correct guidance frequently become an irretrievable pity for the kids during their growth.
It seems that launching reading rooms for kids, building homes for left-behind children, as well as other meaningful things alike can only be managed through crowdfunding.
"As an emerging industry in Internet finance, crowdfunding is gradually extending its advantages to all aspects. It has not only changed our living environment, but also silently changed our ideas."
Han Jianyu, general manager of Xf.cc, said that Xf.cc is engaged in the establishment of a crowdfunding system. A staff member of the company has also raised funds through crowdfunding on WeChat after his family members were attacked by a disease.
What I want to say here is that crowdfunding is not only an industry, but also a positive attitude and an accommodating spirit.
It is boundless. If you need and are brave enough to initiate crowdfunding, everything will become possible.

Sources from Caracas said that Venezuela and Colombia on August 11 agreed on the reopening of their border one year after the closure of the border.
The decision was made after President Maduro of Venezuela and President Santos of Colombia's meeting.
According to BBC, only pedestrians will be allowed to cross in five places along the border during the first stage.
Maduro said after the meeting that he hoped the reopening of the border will help Venezuela resume its economic and trade communications with Colombia and improve the bilateral relations between the two countries.
Santos stressed that the border will be "gradually" opened. It will be a provisional opening as they learn and adjust their decisions every step of the way.
Colombia and Venezuela also agreed to work towards the full reopening of the border, saying they needed first to reach separate agreements on security, commerce and energy.
On August 19 last year, a group of Colombian paramilitaries shot a Venezuelan military patrol in riots with smugglers and wounded three soldiers and a civilian near the border.
Maduro then announced 60 days of martial law in five municipalities in the state of Tachira, which borders on Colombia, and the close of the border of the two countries.
Afterwards, the two sides held many talks in a bid to resolve the crises. They also recalled their ambassadors for discussions.
On September 21, 2015, the leaders of the two countries held a talk and agreed to gradually reopen their border for the first time, so as to normalize their relations.
We always think of beautiful sceneries, mysterious culture and honest villagers while mentioning ethnic villages. However, the impoverishment, sparseness and desolation behind them cannot be ignored.
The incorrect exploration models during the development of ethnic villages not only haven't changed the destiny of the villages, but also accelerated the disappearance of the villages and their culture.
Culture protection is not a static concept. For instance, Guangxi's Liu Sanjie will become meaningless if it is broken away from villages. No matter how excellent it is, the atmosphere of villages will be lacked when it is staged in other places.
Several Bombs Go off in Hua Hin and Some Other Regions in Thailand; Thai Military: Someone May Intend to Make a Mess
CNR reported in an evening news program that a sense of desolation and even tension shrouded the streets in Thailand on August 12, the country's Mother's Day, when it should be lively and peaceful.
From the evening of August 11 to the morning of August 12 (local time), eight bombs successively went off in Hua Hin, a renowned tourism attraction of Thailand, as well as some provinces in the south of the country.

Two bombs exploded in front of two police stations in Surat Thani, respectively, after 8:00 on the morning of August 12, leaving one dead and many injured.
Another two explosions hit two police stations at roadsides on the famous Patong Beach on Phuket Island at 8:41.
It was the Mother's Day and the birthday of the queen of Thailand. However, many regions of the country were in a horrific atmosphere.
A staff member of Hitour, an overseas self-service tour service agency, has just paid a visit to one of the explosion sites.
The attack may have been small with a small harm according to the explosion site.
Disputes have been raised over the draft of Thailand's new constitution since it was unveiled, with focuses on the clauses on military power.
Supporters believed that the new constitution can heal Thailand's wound and promote the stabilization of the country.
Opponents believed that this is an "unfair referendum". Once the constitution is passed, the military will gain more power.
Especially, the new clauses introduced to the draft will weaken political parties' power but give more power to non-elected senators.
The Guardian said that the attacks seemingly targeting tourism attractions actually happened before the anniversary of the Bangkok blast taking place on August 17, 2015.
International observers said that the country's separatists are the biggest suspects, who were in military actions against Thai military in the three southernmost provinces.

Wang Xinliang noted that the elderly-cheating healthcare product companies usually adopt similar ways in cheating. They held lectures, offered presents on site and lured the elderly to buy their products.
"People who listen to the lectures can get 2.5kg eggs for free and those who bring another person to listen to the lectures can get 2.5kg more."
Wang Xinliang said that he has once encountered a case, in which the healthcare product sellers call the elderly either fathers or mothers on lecture sites, which made the elderly feel at home. However, it was actually an emotional marketing trick.
"We felt the treatment effect was good after taking the products. However, they were marked up to RMB 3,000 one week later. Then, we didn't buy them again."
Wang Xinliang said that according to the cases he has encountered in recent two years. The elderly were easy to be cheated. Most of the frauds took place when they buy drugs, healthcare products and wealth management products.
"Some elderly people bought a great number of healthcare products. Some who have high retirement pay didn't follow their kids' advice although they knew they had been cheated. Some even had conflicts with their family members."

According to relevant regulations in law, if merchants publicize your information to revenge you for your comments, they are actually infringing your reputation and information security rights. However, it will cost a lot of time and efforts for you to file a lawsuit against them.
E-commerce platforms have to give play to their monitoring role when relevant administrative departments are investigating and dealing with such cases.
On the other hand, those who publicize others' personal information should be held responsible through laws and regulations. Also, there should be a regulation on the punishment of online slanders.
MIIT Solicits Public Opinions to Raise Thresholds for New-energy Vehicle Makers and Products
Experts said that the opinion solicitation draft will raise the thresholds for new-energy vehicle makers and products, prevent low-level and repeated construction, standardize industrial orders, improve complete new-energy vehicles' quality and expand the application of advanced and applicable new-energy vehicles.
The implementation scope of new-energy vehicles was adjusted to pure electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and fuel cell vehicles in the opinion solicitation draft.
In the meanwhile, the opinion solicitation draft has raised the thresholds for new-energy vehicle companies, including raising the requirements on companies' design and development abilities, production capacities, as well as their ability to guarantee after-sales services.
As for enhancement of the monitoring and control of product safety, the opinion solicitation draft also requires relevant departments to conduct full-life-circle and real-time monitoring of the operation status of all new-energy vehicles (including chassis).
Dong Yang said that we currently have 119 complete new-energy vehicle makers and about ten more qualified ones are expected to be launched within the next two years. Therefore, there will be little impact on the landscape of the new-energy vehicle industry.

The impossibility of the bus driver to communicate with the old lady in language forced him to escort her to the nearby Hongdao Border Police Substation.
At 10 o'clock that evening, the family members of the old lady were informed that she was in the Hongdao Police Substation after they called the police because she did not come back home, and then went to the substation to bring her home.
Through observation, the worker of the bus company found that the old lady dressed properly in clean clothes, and judged that she did not look like an old woman straying outside and coming from a humble background.
Since the worker could not get any valuable clues after one-hour communication, he had to escort the old lay to the nearby Hongdao Border Police Substation and hoped that the police will help the old lady find her family members.
Then, the police talked with the old lady with patience, but she still could not normally communicate with them.
At 10 o'clock that evening, Mr. Yang who lives on Haidian Island called the police and said that his 80-year-old mother got lost in the afternoon and there was no news about her till then.
When responding to the call, the police of the Hongdao Police Substation found that what Mr. Yang described about her mother fit in nicely with the characteristics of this lost old lay, and informed him of coming to the substation to make identification.
Then, Mr. Yang together with his nephew went to the police substation, and found that the old lady there was exactly his mother.
Mr. Yang thanked the police for their finding his mother in time and then brought her home after confirming that she's fit.
According to Mr. Yang, his 80-plus-year-old mother, who hails from Anhui province, told the family members that she wanted to go out for a walk this afternoon, but they did not think about that.
At about 7:00 pm, he hadn't seen his mother coming back home yet, so he requested his relatives and friends to search his mother around his home and the Haidian Island, but it did not work.
He also said that his mother has never taken a bus by herself, and guessed that it might be some good-hearted people helped her go onto the bus. Since she is suffered from minor senile dementia, she did not know where she had gone herself at that time.
After the motor tricycle slowly stopped, the traffic policeman went up to it and found that there were a total of 12 people in the vehicle including the driver.
After the driver got off the vehicle, he repeatedly emphasized that the brake did not work well. The policeman went up to check the brake and found it really did not work well. But the policeman criticized the driver on his behavior and detained the motor tricycle.
After inquiry, the policeman learned that all the 12 people in the vehicle were construction workers. The driver still picked up these workers to work under the condition that he knew the brake did not work well. This behavior was believed to be too dangerous and prone to cause casualty accidents in case of emergency.
The seventh Sino-Russian Cultural Large Set opens at Heihe, Heilongjiang province, on the evening of August 12.
This year's Sino-Russian Cultural Large Set will build a platform for the two countries to promote the alliance of their cultural industry, economy and trade as well as mutual development.
The year 2016 is the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Russian Good-Neighborly Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, and also is the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-Russian Strategic and Cooperative Partnership.
Under the vision of China's "Belt and Road" Initiative, the Chinese and Russian governments leverage the Sino-Russian Cultural Large Set as a platform to conduct a wide range of cooperation in all sectors.
As a large Sino-Russian cross-border culture, trade and exchange event, the Sino-Russian Cultural Large Set represents a platform where the Chinese and Russian people share the achievements of economic development and cultural prosperity, and boost their friendship and cooperation.
As an important carrier of the Sino-Russian friendship and cultural exchanges, the Sino-Russian Cultural Large Set has been successfully held for six years since its inception in 2010.
Fan Zhiguo, Vice Mayor of Heihe, told reporters that economy and trade have always been going ahead together with culture in the course of the development of Heihe.
At this year's Sino-Russian Cultural Large Set, we have invited overseas Chinese leaders and businessmen at home and abroad to Heihe for economic and trade matchmaking based on high-level visits and culture, literature and art group visits between the two countries, aiming to drive the development of bilateral economy and trade between China and Russia.
Fan Zhiguo said that the Sino-Russian Cultural Large Set provides us with a stage for culture, economy and trade to add radiance and beauty to each other.
The Chinese side will take advantage of "the cultural industry promotion engineering" and focus on their own strengths to enable "three strides", i.e. building a platform of cultural exchanges with Russia, opening cultural industry projects and integrating regional cultural resources.
The performances for the previous opening ceremonies of the event had been the focus of the 400,000 Chinese and Russian people concerned. This years' opening ceremony officially kicks off at 19:30 that day.
The performance comprises three chapters including The Dream of the Silk Road, The Interconnected Bridge, and The Flower of Friendship, highlighting the theme of "Cultural Trade, Cultural Exchanges, Economic and Trade Cooperation, Prosperity and Development".
The event also features six key activities including high-end exchange, exhibition, artistic performance, popular culture, sports culture and cultural tourism.
According to Taiwan's United Daily News reported on August 12, COSCO bought the largest stake of the Piraeus Port for US$311 million, and planned to increase its holding to 67 percent in the next five years.
Wan Min, Chairman of COSCO Shipping, said, "The purchasing plan of the Piraeus Port is one of the important milestones of the 'Belt and Road' initiative.
The growth and prosperity of this port can promote the economic development of both China and Greece, opening a new era for trade cooperation and cultural exchanges between the East and the West."
The Piraeus Port is the gateway to Asia, Eastern Europe and North Africa, with the passenger throughput of approximately 16.8 million and some 3.6 million 20-foot containers in 2014, the report said.
Pitsiorlas, Chairman of the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund, Greece's state-owned assets privatization organization, said that it was an important moment to seal the deal.
"The partnership between the two parties in the Piraeus Port is not just economic cooperation, but of strategic significance," he said.
"With this port, Greece is well positioned to be China's gateway to Europe, allowing the two countries to benefit from it."
The Greek government signed an agreement this April to sell the managerial right of the Piraeus Port to COSCO, which became the second important state-owned assets privatization plan Greece has implemented since last year, according to the report.
The state-run COSCO will pay the Greek government annually for the managerial right of the Piraeus Port.
According to related specifications, there are two open excavation sections set at both the south and north ends of Yuhan Tunnel for the southern extension section of Shunhe Viaduct, and time-staggered construction measures are taken for the both open excavation sections to reduce the impact on the traffic, which will be open to traffic in succession.
According to the construction requirements, the traffic organization adopts the "fully enclosed construction" organization scheme during the construction, and the enclosed construction area is closed to the traffic, which will be open to traffic once the conditions are met.
In the period of construction, it is suggested that vehicles running in the east-west direction make a detour to South Second Ring Road, Tuwu Road, North Yuhanxiaoqu Road, Jida Road, Ma'anshan Road, and Jingshi Road, as well as vehicles running in the south-north direction make a detour to Shungeng Road, Yuxing Road, Yingxiongshan Road and other routes.

South Korean Opposition Party: Government's Adherence to the Deployment of the THAAD System to Trigger Strong Opposition from Citizens
On August 11, Kim Sang khun, who is running for the leader of the Minjoo Party of Korea said if the government persisting in doing this, it would cause a large-scale national boycott.
In recent years, the public security organs across the country have been holding fast to the guiding principle in crackdown on gun-related crimes in line with the deployment of the Ministry of Public Security, and have made a huge success.
The cases of gun-related crimes, however, are still on the upswing, especially the increasingly widespread criminal activities of selling guns online, seriously affecting social public order and the people's sense of security.
Through joint search and joint control, they crack down hard on illegal trafficking of guns and circulation channels, with a focus on the key links and channels of gun circulation.

In Mlandizi Town, Kibaha County, Coastal Province, Tanzania, Wang Shusheng from Hebei, China, is keeping busy. And a steel plant will be put into operation here in October.
"The annual demand for steel bars in Tanzania has reached 1.83 million tons, but the quality of locally produced steel bars cannot fulfill the requirements of large buildings such as high-rise buildings and bridges, so the country imports 70 percent of steel bars,"
This entrepreneur who has been dedicated to the steel industry for years pointed out the truth why Tanzania is a great appeal to him - the vast potential of the local market.
As with Wang Shusheng, an increasing number of Chinese entrepreneurs have turned their attention to Africa to seek opportunities.
At the end of this July, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi pointed out at the Coordinator Meeting of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Summit that investment cooperation is being a new powerful impetus for promoting China-Africa cooperation compared to assistance.
Shi Jiyang, President of the China-Africa Development Fund, pointed out that Africa is a new pole of economic growth globally and is the most dynamic region in growth following East Asia and South Asia.
The data from the China-Africa Development Fund shows that the China-Africa trade was worth more than US$200 billion in 2014, and the figure is expected to reach some US$400 billion by 2020.
In 2014, China's direct investment stock in Africa exceeded US$30 billion, a figure that is expected to reach US$100 billion by 2020.
At the China-Africa Media & Think-Tanks Symposium held in Mombasa, Kenya, on August 12, Lemma Senbet, executive director of the African Economic Research Consortium in Kenya, said China has been an important partner for Africa's transformation development.
Wang Shusheng admitted that running a plant here faces a huge challenge of integrating with the local society, but he feels optimistic about the future development prospect.
CBC commentator confuses Michael Phelps with Ryan Lochte for whole race
An Olympics commentator working for Canadian broadcaster CBC suffered embarrassment on Thursday night when he confused Michael Phelps for rival Ryan Lochte.
Elliotte Friedman mixed the pair up for the duration of the 200m individual medley final, which Phelps won to claim his 22nd Olympic gold medal.
As Phelps streaked home for the win, Friedman believed him to be Lochte, Phelps' compatriot and long-term rival at the top of world swimming.
Friedman shouted: "Finally, he's going to do it!"
Ryan Lochte is going to beat Michael Phelps in this event!
Phelps might not even make the podium.
Phelps, however, won while Lochte trailed in fourth.
In the immediate moments after Phelps touched for gold, CBC's broadcast fell silent.
Friedman, admirably, admitted to his error immediately.
I apologise, I got my lanes mixed up.
Phelps with the gold," he said.
The Canadian commentator, whose professionalism has been widely praised after the mistake, owned up to his error once again in the hours after the event and apologised to viewers on Twitter.
I'm sorry everyone.
I blew it.
"No excuses," he wrote.
Phelps, meanwhile, broke a 2,168-year-old record for the most all-time individual Olympic titles with the victory.
The previous record was held by Leonidas of Rhoses, who is believed to have won more Olympic titles at the ancient games than anyone else.
Parking at the happiest place on Earth should be easier the find in the future.
Disneyland has released details of a long-proposed parking structure, a transportation hub and a new pedestrian bridge on the eastern end of the theme park resort.
The project, located east of the resort near the 5 Freeway, includes a 6,800-space parking structure and a transportation hub where buses, shuttles, taxis and other vehicles can drop off park visitors.
A pedestrian bridge over Harbor Boulevard connects the resort to the parking structure and the transportation hub.
The structure, along with the 14-acre Star Wars Land expansion project under construction, is part of a $1-billion investment promised to the city of Anaheim in exchange for a 30-year exemption on an entertainment tax.
Construction of the project, dubbed the Eastern Gateway, will begin next year.
The parking structure will be built on Disney's Pumbaa parking lot, which has about 1,300 spaces.
The transportation hub will replace a commercial property that the theme park purchased in 2014.
The project is expected to open in 2018.
"The Eastern Gateway is part of our substantial investment in Anaheim, which will provide additional guest parking and help to alleviate congestion in the resort district as we continue to expand the Disneyland Resort," Disney spokeswoman Suzi Brown said.
Thailand Bomb Blasts At Tourist Hotspots Kill Four
A series of bomb blasts across five of Thailand's southern provinces targeted popular tourist destinations on Thursday and Friday, leaving four people dead and many more injured, after the country voted to approve a military-backed constitution.
Two explosions first hit the seaside resort of Hua Hin on Thursday night, before another blast struck on Friday morning.
The town is located some 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.
The first blast killed one Thai woman and injured 20 people, 10 of them foreigners, police said.
Authorities confirmed that other blasts had targeted the southern cities of Phuket, Trang and Surat Thani.
Two bombs exploded in the town of Patong in Phuket and two more in Phang Nga, another tourist region just north of Phuket.
A total of 11 bomb blasts struck the country over the last 24 hours.
The blasts were not linked to Islamic extremism but acts of local sabotage, Royal Thai Police official Col. Krisana Patanacharoen said on Friday.
"It's too soon to jump to any conclusion," he said.
But what we know for sure is that the incidents are not linked directly to any kinds of terrorism, in fact it's local sabotage and we are trying to identify those responsible behind the scenes.
Investigation officials collect evidence from the crime scene after a small bomb exploded in Hua Hin on August 12, 2016.
A string of bomb attacks targeting Thailand's crucial tourism industry have killed four people, officials said on August 12, sending authorities scrambling to identify a motive and find the perpetrators.
There are no conflicts in the country that may lead to terrorists being in the country.
"That's why we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack and authorities have not accused any particular group, but the explosions occurred in the same week that Thai voters approved a new constitution.
The three southern provinces of Hua Hin, Phuket and Phang Nga all rejected the military-backed referendum, and the Muslim-majority southeastern provinces of Thailand have faced an insurgency that has left more than 6,500 people dead since 2004.
The blasts came on the birthday of Thailand's Queen Sirikit, a public holiday in the country.
Hua Hin hosts the Klai Kangwon royal palace, or "Far From Worries Palace," where the country's monarchy have often stayed.
King Bhumibol Adulayadej is the world's longest-serving monarch.
Signs of Trouble in Ukraine Prompt Question: What's Vladimir Putin Up To?
It's difficult to judge the truth of these claims.
Ukraine denies them, and both the United States and the European Union say Russia has provided no evidence.
An open-source analysis group, the Digital Forensic Research Lab, found some indications of a firefight on Saturday, but little to back up Moscow's grander claims.
Russia has been known to distort or misstate events to serve political ends, particularly within the fog of Ukraine's still-ongoing conflict.
That doesn't mean that Russia's claims are all false.
Ukrainian militias last year sabotaged electricity pylons that power Crimea, and some of them are involved in criminal activity and human rights violations.
An attempted attack in Crimea is not out of the question, though there is little reason to suspect the Ukrainian government would sponsor such a plot.
Whatever happened, images found by open-source analysts suggest that Russia has been escalating its military presence in Crimea since at least Saturday - before the supposed attack occurred.
These show convoys of heavy weapons moving on the peninsula, including missile systems intended for coastal defense.
A disturbingly familiar Russian escalation
Some reports indicate that Russia's troops in Crimea were already scheduled for a new rotation about now, which would help explain the activity, though it would be quite a coincidence that this just happened to fall during some of the highest tensions since the 2014 annexation.
Whatever transpired over the weekend, Mr. Putin has unquestionably escalated in his language toward Ukraine, choosing to use this episode - however real it was - for some larger aim.
Analysts have pointed out disturbing parallels with how Russia behaved just before previous military actions against Ukraine.
In February 2014, similar speeches and military maneuvers provided cover for Crimean volunteer militias to seize the peninsula, then still controlled by Ukraine, only to reveal they were in fact Russian special forces launching a military occupation.
That August, as Russian-backed separatists lost ground in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin stationed troops along the border, warning they might be necessary to "protect" ethnic Russian civilians in Ukraine who he said were under attack.
He orchestrated an aid convoy into the region that, according to NATO, was mere cover for a Russian invasion force.
What is Mr. Putin planning in Crimea?
Some have wondered whether Moscow might be plotting another intervention.
Fighting has increased in eastern Ukraine, as it did before the August 2014 incursion.
But that seeming parallel may be the point, meant to create fear of military action - rather than actual action - that will give Mr. Putin leverage with Ukraine and with Western countries.
Mark Galeotti, a New York University professor who studies Russia, pointed out that Crimea would make little sense as a staging ground for military action against eastern Ukraine, which borders mainland Russia but not Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better defended.
"It's highly unlikely that the Russians are truly planning some major offensive," Mr. Galeotti said.
Rather, "We're looking at a classic Russian strategy of building up tension."
International peace talks over Ukraine, once the mechanism by which Mr. Putin forced contact with Western leaders who had shunned him over annexing Crimea, have become increasingly regarded as fruitless and irrelevant.
By dangling the threat of renewed conflict, Mr. Putin gives the talks a new purpose: to coax him back from the brink.
"It's a standard Putin tactic - he wants to try to go there from a position of strength," Mr. Galeotti said of the next peace talks, planned for early September.
"And the only real strength is to say, "I could make things much, much worse if I wanted to." "
Positioning for a bargain with the West
Mr. Putin also said this week that it made little sense to continue negotiations amid the Crimea tensions, forcing the other parties to persuade him to come back to the table - and putting himself at the center of the process.
What does this actually get him?
For one, it allows Russia to continue asserting itself as a global power, even though its economy is smaller than Australia's.
For another, it positions Moscow as having a veto over Ukraine's sovereignty, keeping the country within some degree of Russian control.
It may also serve Mr. Putin's long-held hopes of a grand bargain with the United States that would settle their disputes over Ukraine and Syria - on terms favorable to Moscow, naturally - as well as ending Western sanctions against Russia.
Mr. Putin has repeatedly hinted at this goal since his nation's economy began collapsing in late 2014, due mostly to the declining value of its oil and gas exports.
Since intervening in Syria last fall, he has repeatedly invited Western powers to join him in a grand coalition to fight extremists.
But Russian leaders may believe that they would need to secure such a deal before January, when President Obama will leave office.
Russian officials tend to view Hillary Clinton as the likely successor and as more hostile to Moscow.
Donald J. Trump, while conspicuously friendly toward Russia, is still seen as unpredictable.
But Mr. Obama is seen as "looking for resolutions, not conflicts," Mr. Galeotti said.
So there is a sense that there's a closing window of opportunity to get something done quickly.
In the meantime, should no grand bargain come, Mr. Putin appears happy to keep Russia's weaker neighbor guessing about what's coming next.
An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.
It was 2014, not 2013.
With Congress Deadlocked, White House Diverts Funds to Fight Zika
The Obama administration on Thursday said it was shifting $81 million away from biomedical research and antipoverty and health care programs to pay for the development of a Zika vaccine, resorting to extraordinary measures because Congress has failed to approve new funding to combat the virus.
Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, told members of Congress in a letter that without the diverted funds, the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority would run out of money to confront the mosquito-borne illness by the end of the month.
That would force the development of a vaccine to stop at a critical time, as locally acquired cases of Zika infection increase in Miami.
As of last week, 7,350 cases of Zika had been reported in the United States, most in Puerto Rico, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Ms. Burwell said that 15 infants had been born with Zika-related birth defects.
The virus can cause abnormal brain development and other serious defects in children born to infected mothers.
The local spread of the illness in the continental United States, with the first cases reported late last month, has raised the political stakes surrounding the federal government's response.
Hillary Clinton on Tuesday made a campaign stop in Wynwood, the Miami neighborhood that has had a rash of locally transmitted Zika cases, and pressed Congress to return from its five-week break to approve emergency funding to fight the virus.
President Obama and congressional Republicans have been at odds for most of the year over Zika.
In February, Mr. Obama requested $1.9 billion in emergency funding.
Republicans balked, demanding a more detailed accounting of where the money would go.
Lawmakers have feuded for months over how much money should be earmarked and how it should be spent.
Last month, Democrats blocked consideration of a Republican measure that would have allocated $1.1 billion to fight Zika but included provisions that would have banned funding for Planned Parenthood to provide contraception related to the virus, which can be sexually transmitted.
The deadlock prompted the White House in April to shift $589 million in Ebola funding to the Zika effort, about two-thirds of it designated for domestic use.
On Thursday, Ms. Burwell said that her department had used most of that money, and that it would be gone by the end of August.
"The failure to pass a Zika emergency supplemental has forced the administration to choose between delaying critical vaccine development work and raiding other worthy government programs to temporarily avoid these delays," Ms. Burwell wrote.
Democrats seized on the announcement to berate Republicans for failing to provide additional money for Zika.
At a news conference, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, called on Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, to bring Congress back to advance such a measure.
"Every possible option is being exhausted, and now we're going into the National Institutes of Health, which is supposed to be a priority," Ms. Pelosi said.
Aides to Mr. Ryan said that shifting the funds was a long-overdue step that the Obama administration had delayed to squeeze maximum political advantage out of the Zika issue.
The National Institutes of Health announced last week that it had begun clinical trials of a Zika vaccine on 80 human subjects, and hoped to begin a second phase in "Zika-endemic countries" in early 2017.
But without more funding now, officials said Thursday, the research would halt in its tracks.
Ms. Burwell said she would transfer to the Zika efforts $34 million in N.I.H. funds that had been designated to find treatments for other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
Another $47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of drugs and vaccines to respond to public health emergencies.
That money will come out of a variety of accounts, including $19 million from a program that supplies heating oil subsidies for low-income families and $4 million from substance abuse programs such as those for opioid addiction.
Even then, Ms. Burwell said, the additional money will last only through next month, at which point agencies would have to "severely curtail many of their critical efforts" against Zika without action from Congress.
In the last four months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spent $60 million to help states protect pregnant women, $25 million to strengthen their Zika preparedness and response plans, and $16 million to help them create data-collection systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other Zika-related syndromes.
Thai Leader Links Attacks on Tourist Sites to Constitution Change
The head of the Thai junta urged his countrymen on Friday to have patience while investigators determine who was behind a wave of deadly bombings in Thailand this week.
Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the junta chief and prime minister, hinted that the perpetrators were "bad people" opposed to a new Constitution that was approved by voters on Sunday in a nationwide referendum.
"There are still bad people, and they have been acting since before the referendum," he said in an address to the nation.
The bombings in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including in Phuket and Hua Hin, areas popular with tourists, killed four people and injured dozens.
The authorities said arson attacks elsewhere in the country appeared to be related.
Analysts said the bombings did not appear to be aimed at killing many people, but rather at damaging the tourism industry, one of the few bright spots in Thailand's economy.
At least nine foreign visitors were injured in Hua Hin.
"Whatever the motives are, the explosions and arson attacks undermine the junta's claim that the post-referendum situation would be stable," said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.
These attacks create effects that discredit the authorities, terrorize the public and harm the tourism-based economy.
Photo Thai rescue workers treated a victim injured by a bomb that exploded in Hua Hin on Friday.
The police said they did not believe that the bombings were tied to international terrorism or to a long-running Islamic insurgency in southern Thailand.
They have portrayed the attacks as "local sabotage," not terrorism.
The timing and location of the attacks carried strong political symbolism.
The bombings occurred as people prepared to celebrate the birthday of Queen Sirikit on Friday, which is considered Mother's Day in Thailand.
Four bombs struck the royal residential town of Hua Hin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where most injuries occurred.
The military-drafted Constitution will diminish the influence of political parties and give greater power to the military even after it returns the government to civilian control.
The junta helped ensure its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it.
Murray Hiebert, an expert on Southeast Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, noted the military's suspicion that the attacks were carried out by people disgruntled over the vote.
The bombings were "clearly coordinated but obviously intended to create fear and anxiety rather than massive damage and deaths and injuries," he said.
Last year, a bombing at the popular Erewan shrine in Bangkok killed 20 people, most of them tourists from China.
Thai officials attributed the bombing to Uighur militants angry over the return of more than 100 Uighurs to China.
General Prayuth, who has led the junta since a 2014 coup ousted a civilian government, said this week's bombings "hurt the hearts" of Thai people.
"Why now, when the country is getting better, the economy is getting better, and tourism is getting better?" he said.
We have to ask why, and who did it.
Golden Reaction: What Simone Manuel's Historic Moment Looked Like
Just coming into this race tonight, I kind of tried to take the weight of the black community off my shoulders, which is something I carry with me just being in this position.
But I do hope that it kind of goes away.
I'm super glad with the fact I can be an inspiration to others and hopefully diversify the sport.
But at the same time I would like there to be a day where there are more of us and it's not Simone, the black swimmer, because the title black swimmer makes it seem like I'm not supposed to be able to win a gold medal or I'm not supposed to be able to break records.
That's not true because I work just as hard as anybody else and I love the sport and I want to win just like everybody else.
The Fight to Protect L.G.B.T. Students in Colombia
Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Urrego jumped to his death from a shopping center in Bogotá, leaving as his suicide note a Facebook post quoting Pink Floyd's "Goodbye Cruel World."
His death was the genesis of a controversy that roiled Colombia this week, as the effort to expand L.G.B.T. rights was drawn into a broader political fight that has polarized the nation.
After his death, Mr. Urrego's mother, Alba Reyes, sued school officials, faulting them for ostracizing her only son after discovering that he and a classmate had an intimate relationship.
A year later, Colombia's highest court issued a sweeping ruling in her favor, calling on schools nationwide to develop clearer policies to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a string of legal victories for Colombia's gay rights movement, which earlier this year celebrated a decision that legalized same-sex marriage.
This week, though, their fight for equality hit an obstacle as Gina Parody, the minister of education - who is openly gay - became the flashpoint of a scandal over the implementation of the ruling.
The fracas started when sexually explicit content from a pornographic magazine began circulating on social media, peddled by people who claimed it was part of a guidance manual issued by the education ministry.
Ms. Parody quickly debunked that.
While the ministry offered guidance to schools on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity in an effort to help them heed the ruling, it has not sought to impose standardized rules.
"What we want is for schools to have the tools to resolve conflicts," Ms. Parody said in an interview on Thursday.
The dispute opened a new front in a national debate over the future of a country torn over peace negotiations between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, a guerrilla group.
A coalition of politicians opposed to the government and leaders of the Catholic Church mobilized with extraordinary speed, accusing the government of President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting same-sex unions and gender fluidity.
To complicate matters, the government delegation negotiating with the FARC in Havana recently reached an accord on gender and L.G.B.T. equality that calls on the government to adopt more inclusive policies.
Critics of the government - and the peace talks - pounced on Ms. Parody, a 42-year-old rising star in Colombian politics.
They displayed crude posters at rallies and some threatened violence against her and her partner, Cecilia Álvarez-Correa Glen, the former commerce minister.
Ms. Parody remained admirably stoic throughout the bruising week as she sought to set the record straight and recast the debate on constructive terms.
"Part of what has kept me standing and clear-headed is knowing that there are kids out there who are in the process of coming out of the closet," she said.
This is a tough stage and a very lonely time.
She also drew a connection between the peace process and the debate over L.G.B.T. students.
As Colombians continue to weigh the merits of a deal with the FARC, which would mark an seismic turning point for the country, they must consider the roots of the conflict, she said.
"Is a peaceful country one that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it one in which everyone has equal opportunities?" she said.
While she takes no pleasure in having been the target of insults and harassment this week, she is glad that in today's Colombia, gay students can look up to her and consider that they, too, can aspire to serve as a minister one day.
"To me, it's critical that they can be at ease and that they realize that they can reach their full potential," Ms. Parody said.
We can't wait for a new suicide to start changing.
Keeping the Vote Cybersafe - The New York Times
In "U.S. Seeking Ways to Keep Hackers Out of Ballot Box" (news article, Aug.
4), Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says the Obama administration is discussing giving extra protections to the nation's electoral system.
This change may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
The diverse nature of the cyberthreat, and the recent revelation that outside actors, possibly nation-states, have an increased interest in influencing our elections, make it imperative that the federal government give additional attention to securing our electoral system and possibly deem it part of our nation's critical infrastructure.
Without delay, Mr. Johnson should communicate with the thousands of jurisdictions in the country that help carry out elections and offer the Department of Homeland Security's assistance, expertise and guidance.
While the diverse and varied nature of our voting infrastructure confounds efforts to secure it, this tells us that the process should begin as soon as possible.
The writer, Democrat of Mississippi, is the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee.
The UK government recently announced suddenly the suspension of the project of Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station in the UK in partnership with China and France, attracting a wide spread attention at home and abroad.
A UK government spokesman recently said that the deferral of the project does not mean the UK has chilled its enthusiasm for China, as China and the UK are still cooperating in a wide range of sectors and the UK will continue to seek to maintain the strong partnership with China.
Some experts pointed out that China's nuclear power leads the world in technical level, safety performance, operating experience and all other aspects, as well as has relatively low costs.
Therefore, although "Nuclear Power Going Global" will experience trials and tribulations in a given period, the trend of mutually beneficial cooperation between the parties will not be changed in the context of huge win-win potential.
But these words clearly do not hold true for what the UK did in the project of Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station.
Once the project is completed, it will meet 7 percent of the UK's power demands and help reduce 9 million tons of carbon dioxide annually in the operation period of 60 years.
Analysts generally believe that complicated factors in the UK such as exposed economic risks, increasing disputes among domestic politics, cumbersome subsequent procedures after Brexit, and increasing future uncertainties all impede its nuclear power projects.
"Currently, since property prices in the UK are falling and outflow of capital starts occurring, keeping domestic economy and market system stable has been the top priority of the UK's new government.
Meanwhile, after the approval of Brexit vote, the UK also needs to face a number of Brexit procedures in the coming days and straighten out its relationship with EU countries like France again.
Xu Mingqi said that though the UK's new government shows apparent eagerness to "differentiate from" the previous government, it does not deny the positive significance of nuclear power projects.
Over the past two decades, however, the UK has seen the stagnation of the development of its nuclear power, and a majority of its existing 15 nuclear power stations have reached their design lifetime.
According to the prediction of the UK's Energy White Paper, there will be only one nuclear power station still in service in the UK by 2025, leading to major gaps in electric power supply.
For this reason, the parties express their common concerns about the suspension of this project benefiting the public welfare by the UK government.
In the view of Scuoler, where it is in the interests of the both countries, China can play a key role in helping the UK reconstructing infrastructures.
Liu Xiaoming said that we look forward to successfully starting and implementing the project as early as possible, providing the UK with safe, reliable and sustainable energy.
According to insiders, projects of nuclear power stations are instrumental in the reduction of electricity cost for the British public, while at the same time driving local economy and employment.
So, if the UK's new government makes a final decision from the prospective of maximizing its people's welfare, nuclear power projects will not see a gloomy outlook.
The UK side can address energy demand gap, and the sides of both China and France can find the market for their own advantageous technologies and products in the field of nuclear power, benefiting more people."
In spite of the increasing uncertainty of the Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station project, there is no doubt about China's high-level and sophisticated experience in nuclear power technology.
Taking China's "Hualong 1" that will enter the British nuclear power market as scheduled as an example, it incorporates the advantages of other advanced nuclear power technologies and drew previous experience in design.
For instance, China has designed the "passive residual heat removal system at the secondary side of vapor generator" based on problems reflected in Japan's Fukushima nuclear accident, which can remove the heat from reactor cores in time, avoiding the meltdown of reactor cores.
Liu Xiaoming said that China has been keeping a good track record and safety level during the development of nuclear power for more than 30 years, and international institutions set a high value on the achievements it has made in nuclear power development and regulatory.
It is now an important historic moment for the relationship between China and the UK, so mutual respect and trust are more valuable than ever.
The Chinese side hoped that the UK government continues to support the Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station project, and makes a decision as early as possible to ensure the successful implementation of the project.
In the opinion of He Weiwen, Co-chair of the Sino-America-Europe Economic Strategy Research Center, the China Association of International Trade (CAIT), since there is limited time for the British side to make the decision, the both parties need more substantive communications and dialogues.
"Following the change of president of Argentina, the China-Argentina nuclear power station project was also laid aside temporarily, but it has now been clearly scheduled to begin construction in the first quarter of next year."

The 9th China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week will officially enter the extended period from August 8 and host 70 activities throughout the year.
In the previous opening period, government officials, presidents from colleges and universities, experts and scholars alike from China and 10 ASEAN countries conducted effective exchanges in plans for educational development.
In addition, it is worth noting that the 2nd "China-ASEAN Education Ministers Round Table" brings together all the education ministers from the 11 countries for a second time six years later since the inception of China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week.
This year marks the "China-ASEAN Education Exchange Year" and also is the 25th anniversary of the dialogue relationship established between China and ASEAN.
In recent years, China and ASEAN countries has been increasingly deepening exchanges and cooperation in all domains, and constantly launched highlights in educational cooperation.
It is understood that, during the education exchange Week held by the two parties for years in a row, nearly 800 cooperation agreements were signed, continuously enabling win-win cooperation in people-to-people exchange.
In this exchange year, as flagship programs of the Education Year, the 9th China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week and the 2nd China-ASEAN Education Ministers Round Table were of particular concern.
And, "China-ASEAN Qingzhen Vocational Education Center" and "China-ASEAN Rail Transit Education and Training Alliance" were inaugurated as well.
The "China-ASEAN Education Exchange Year" that has been held for years running provides a goal of closer regional education cooperation for building the "China-ASEAN Community of Shared Future".
"The China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week plays an irreplaceable role in deepening human-oriented exchange between the two parties and erecting the "Bridge of Soul, Bridge of Friendship, Bridge of Understanding."
Today, the attention paid by people to tumors is increasing rapidly, which in a large part might be linked to cancer incidence at a high level in recent years.
According to reports about cancer in 2012, there were about 3.37 million new cancer cases and some 2.11 million death cases in China every year.
Cancer has been the No.1 cause of death in China, with the death toll accounting for one quarter of the global death toll due to cancer.
Due to its uncontrolled growth and proliferation, caner can affect nearly every part of human body.
Generally speaking, any part of human body might suffer from cancer, and some kinds of cancers will also be transferred to other part of the body.
Cancer is a genetic disease, but studies found that only a small number of cancers are genetic.
Many factors can affect the occurrence and development of cancers, among which environmental factors are on top of the list and can be changed.
Environmental factors include smoking, infectious factors, radiation, pollution as well as foods, nutrition, and physical activities, etc.
After Mr. Li was sent to the hospital, the doctor told his family members that he was in a serious situation because he was in a hyperosmolar coma caused by severe dehydration as a result of diarrhea, and he might die if sent here a few minutes later.
According to statistics, the symptom of diarrhea might be found in some 20% of diabetics, particularly previously untreated patients or those whose blood glucose has not been controlled properly.
For some diabetics, chronic diarrhea might even the primary disease symptom, which is so deceptive and then leads to missed diagnosis and misdiagnose.
Diarrhea in the wake of dyspepsia can lead to anorexia and nausea, and taking digestives can help the illness take a turn for a better way; for bacterial diarrhea, the disease generally comes in suddenly and several times a day, accompanying with the feeling of abdominal pain, but it can get recovery after a short-term treatment.
And for diabetic diarrhea, it is mostly expressed in refractory diarrhea without obvious abdominal pain and with assayed excrements that do not accompany infection in most cases, but the number of diarrhea is significantly increased, up to 20-plus times a day.
Additionally, when some hypoglycemic drugs such as melbine (DMBG) or α-glucosidase inhibitor are taken at very onset, patients might happen to side effects like abdominal distension, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
This is because stress hyperglycemia together with hypoglycemia condition might occur after diarrhea in case of inflammation.
Moreover, human body is in a stress situation due to diarrhea, releasing multiple hormones. While its confrontation with diarrhea, human body will also suffer from much blood glucose that outflows, which might cause ketoacidosis in severe cases.
Therefore, in addition to etiological treatment in hospital, diabetics should also pay attention to the following aspects after diarrhea.
Diabetics suffering from acute diarrhea must prevent dehydration first, so it is necessary to drink more water, which naturally helps them with more urination, allowing for draining unnecessary blood glucose as well as acetone bodies.
However, it is best not to have drinks containing caffeine because caffeine can stimulate gastrointestinal motility and then aggravate diarrhea.
For diabetics, blood glucose regulation will be out of balance in case of acute diarrhea, so they must closely observe the changes of blood glucose. It is best to measure blood glucose every 3 to 4 hours.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved field tests of genetically altered mosquitoes to be conducted in Florida in the southeast of the United States.
This kind of genetically altered mosquito can help control the transmission of mosquito-borne infectious diseases such as Zika, Dengue fever and Chikungunya fever.
According to a preliminary environmental assessment report released by the FDA in March, this kind of mosquito will not significantly affect the environment.
The report also noted that, however, this did not mean this kind of mosquito can be used for commercial purpose.
Oxitec also must follow other regulations specified by the federal, state and local governments, and work together with its local partner Florida Keys Mosquito Control District to determine the time of conducting field tests.
Tests conducted in Brazil, Panama and Cayman Islands showed that this kind of mosquito can reduce the number of mosquitoes in test areas by more than 90%.
There are also controversies about utilizing transgenic technology to "eliminate mosquitoes with mosquitoes", among which some experts believed that this will bring unknown influence to environment.
In addition, Anhui province has established the Major Medicines Monitoring Directory Warning Management System, periodically publishing monitoring directories of high-price, large-consumption and non-treatment adjuvant drugs and making them public.

Fortunately, a good-hearted passerby found that. Then, he continuously shouted at the truck driver, and drove his car to overtake the truck and forced it to stop, helping the man be off the hook.
The good-hearted passerby is called Yang Dong (assumed name), and his automobile data recorder shot the breathtaking scene.
The video data showed that, at about 18:14 on the day of the incident, Yang Dong driving his car passed by the incident road section, and a middle-aged man on a bike came out of the roadside of the rear of the truck all of a sudden.
When the truck driver was getting ready to turn the truck to the left and directly ran down the man who was quickly pulled under the bottom of the truck.
However, at that time the truck driver looked at Yang Dong with a blank expression, and did not know what he meant, but got ready to continue to drive forward.
In such emergency, Yang Dong promptly pulled down his car window, shouting loudly at the truck driver, "There is someone under your truck, stop it right now!"
Just then, he drove his car fast to overtake the truck and got in the way to stop it.
Afterwards, the man crawled out from under the truck and stood up. After preliminary checkup, he just suffered from broken skin on his knees and there were no open wounds on other areas of his body.
The next day, he uploaded the driving video onto the Internet to remind drivers that they should pay attention to the condition under their car during driving, and many netizens gave a thumbs-up to his practice.
It is said that Steve is a graphic designer who is the very image of Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, from whom the biggest difference is that he has intact ears.
Previously, Steve and people around him did not notice this aspect, but his fellows mentioned it after Steve grew his beards one month ago.
One of Steve's friends sent a link to him and encouraged him to apply for partaking in the competition of the man who is like Vincent van Gogh most.
Now, Steve has made it to Top 30 in the competition, and if he wins the game, he will get an €5,000 (RMB 37,000) prize and a bronze head statue for the winner.
Steve is very happy with his look exactly like Vincent van Gogh, and said that if he could win the competition, he will leverage the prize to hold a party with the theme about Vincent van Gogh to thank his friends for their support and love.

According to Sweden's Dagens Nyheter, identity theft has been one of the fastest-growing crimes in Sweden society.
Identity theft is a crime form of illegally obtaining other persons' identity information and leveraging it to pose as them for profit.
The survey data from Sifo shows that one quarter of the respondents said that they disclosed their personal information in email, SMS or other social media over the past 12 months.
The president of My Safety, a Sweden insurance company, pointed out that one reason of the high frequency of criminal cases of identity theft was that people are incautious when using personal information, allowing criminals to take advantage of loopholes.
It is reported that the Swedish police have invested massive resources in the fight against identity theft crimes at the beginning of this summer.
Only if the stolen identity is used for fraudulent activities, such as shopping in the name of another person online, it can constitute a criminal act.
There is a flourishing new housing rental market in cities across Sweden, Svenska Dagbladet recently reported.
The latest data showed that the waiting time for the availability of new rental housing was extended instead of shortened in almost a year.
In particular, the waiting time for the availability of housing in the center and outskirts of the capital Stockholm was extended for up to two years.
At present, the average waiting time for signing a new housing contract in Stockholm is a minimum of 16.5 years, while that in the outskirts of Stockholm is also more than 13 years.
According to head of marketing at Swedish Housing Authority, supply falls to meet the demand in Stockholm's first-hand housing rental market, the waiting time increases too fast, and the waiting time for the availability has hit an all-time high.
It is reported that although tens of thousands of first-hand houses have been delivered in Stockholm this year, the demands for first-hand housing rental are still on steady increase.
According to the data, the availability of first-hand houses (only including old houses, but excluding new house rental) in the first half of this year was only 2,006 units, and the number of people waiting for a first-hand contract has exceeded 540,000.
Svenska Dagbladet estimates that if the present pace is kept, it might take 130 years to get a rental house after application.
According to the data over the past 12 months, housing crisis is not just a phenomenon found in one city - the capital Stockholm, but in Goteborg and Malmo regions the waiting time for the availability of first-hand housing rental has also been extended in varying degrees.

Boy hurt on Pennsylvania roller coaster, week's third amusement park injury
A boy was injured when he fell from a roller coaster on Thursday and he was flown to a Pittsburgh hospital, emergency services and park officials said, in the third accident this week involving children hurt on U.S. amusement park rides.
The child, whose identity were not released, was flown to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh about 50 miles (80 km) west of Idlewild and SoakZone theme park in Ligonier, Pennsylvania, a spokeswoman for Westmoreland County Emergency Services said.
The 3-year-old boy, who was on the ride with his brother, was conscious while being treated on site, park spokesman Jeff Croushore said in an email
Croushore said the ride, known as Rollo Coaster, would be closed pending an investigation.
Idlewild requires children to be at least 3 feet (91 cm) tall to ride the roller coaster, and those shorter than 4 feet (122 cm) must be accompanied by an adult.
The ride was built in 1938, according to the park's website, and the state department of agriculture said it passed inspection in August.
A hospital spokesman declined to comment on the boy's condition.
A 10-year-old boy died on Sunday from a neck injury sustained while riding the world's tallest water slide in Kansas City, Kansas.

Japanese PM Abe will not visit war-dead shrine on WW2 anniversary: Jiji
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will not visit a controversial shrine for war dead in Tokyo on the anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War Two defeat, Jiji news agency has reported.
However, Abe plans to send a ritual offering to the Yasukuni Shrine to mark the anniversary on Monday, Jiji reported on Thursday.
The shrine honors 14 Japanese leaders convicted as war criminals and is seen in China and South Korea as a symbol of Tokyo's wartime militarism.
Abe has not visited the shrine in person since December 2013, which he said he did to show respect for those who died for their country.
Japan's new defense minister, Tomomi Inada, has declined to say whether she would visit the shrine because it was a matter of conscience.
Inada, a close ally of Abe and a supporter of revamping Japan's pacifist constitution, had made regular visits to Yasukuni in the past.
Masahiro Imamura, the minister for reconstruction of disaster-stricken areas, visited the shrine on Thursday and said he prayed for Japan's peace and prosperity, Kyodo news agency reported.
Ties between China and Japan, Asia's two largest economies, have been strained of late after a growing number of Chinese coastguard and other government ships sailed near disputed islets in the East China Sea, called the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.
Two suspects held in possible Rio Olympics plot: police
Police arrested two people on Thursday suspected of supporting Islamic State in planning a possible attack during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Police had arrested 12 people before Thursday's operation, all suspected of collaboration with Islamic State militants.
Brazil's federal police said three others have been interrogated and later released.
The two arrested on Thursday were Brazilians, but police did not provide names or other details.
Although Brazil has no history of conflict with known militant groups, the government has said the Games made the country a more likely target, particularly because of participation by countries fighting Islamic State.
Its militants control parts of Iraq and Syria and a U.S.-led coalition has conducted air strikes against them.
The group has supporters worldwide who have carried out shootings and bombings of civilians.
New suspect in French priest killing formally charged
A man under arrest since Monday as part of the investigation into the killing of a French priest last month has been placed under formal investigation, a police source told Reuters on Friday.
The 21-year old suspect is under investigation for collaboration with terrorists and was planning attacks on people, the source said.
The man had been in telephone contact with Adel Kermiche and Abdel Malik Petitjean, who interrupted a church service in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, western France, on July 26, and slit the throat of 85-year-old Roman Catholic priest Father Jacques Hamel.
Both were shot dead by police.
The suspect had traveled from his home town near Toulouse to Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray and spent the night there in the days before the attack, the source said.
The young man, who has no criminal record, has acknowledged having spent the night there but told investigators that he had left the next day because he did not had a good relationship with Kermiche and Petitjean, the source said.
Investigators are trying to establish whether Kermiche and Petitjean had accomplices in France and whether they had links with Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack.
A cousin of Petitjean was also placed in preventive detention at the end of last month.
Dorus de Vries undergoes medical ahead of Celtic move
Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Dorus de Vries has arrived in Glasgow as he looks to complete a move to Celtic.
De Vries was pictured entering Ross Hall Hospital ahead of a medical after the Hoops agreed terms with the Sky Bet Championship club.
Parkhead boss Brendan Rodgers is on the look-out for an experienced stopper to challenge current number one Craig Gordon.
But Rodgers has trust in 35-year-old de Vries having worked with the Dutchman during their spell together at Swansea.
He made 51 appearances for the Swans as they won promotion to the Premier League under Rodgers in 2011.
He quit the Welsh outfit that summer to join Wolves and has been at the City Ground since 2013.
He also has experience of playing in Scotland after spending a season with Dunfermline after signing back in 2006.
His East End Park stay ended in disappointment, however, as the Pars suffered the double agony of being relegated from the top-flight before losing out to Celtic in the final of the Scottish Cup.
The keeper has just one year left on his Forest contract and it has been reported Celtic will only have to pay a nominal fee to land his signature.
During Rio 2016 Olympic Games, security issue has been what people care about all the time, and people underwent another bomb fright before a men's basketball game this morning.
The Rio Olympics organizing committee confirms that the police working together with the military have detonated a suspicious knapsack found in the basketball stadium under control before the basketball game between Spain and Nigeria kicked off.
A security guard told Reuters that this suspicious knapsack was found after the end of the basketball game between Brazil and Croatia.
The police found the suspicious knapsack in a garbage can in a bathroom, according to the statement from a spokesman of the organizing committee.
Afterwards, the knapsack was carried away by a robot which then detonated it under the guidance of the police and military.
The statement also mentioned, "There is a tablet, a pair of socks and a jacket in the knapsack."
As the game between Spain and Nigeria kicked off, there were no spectators in the stadium, who were allowed to enter it after the security had been confirmed by the police.
The Spain's NBA superstar Pau Gasol said that the players got confused about the then condition for a time, "We heard the explosion, but did not know what happened on earth.
At the beginning, we just heard the explosion and then looked around, but found everything was OK."
There was also a suspicious bomb threat in the previous men's road cycling race at the Rio Olympics, but fortunately, the bomb-disposal squad controlled and detonated a suspicious package near the finishing line.
In scorching and sweltering summer, an increasing number of skin problems will be found in infants, which is closely linked to sweating more.
Temperature rise means the beginning of nightmare of many parents as their little baby starts suffering from itchy skin, accompanied with symptoms such as red rash and red spot, thus causing them to constantly scratch the skin and cry all the time at night.
Tan Xiaohua, a paediatrician from The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, observed that the proportion of little patients with skin diseases who seek for outpatient service will be increased every summer, and skin problems such as mosquito bites, eczema, reddish sudamen and diaper rash are more prominent.
In spite of various causes of formation, the symptoms are all much of a muchness, reflected in skin with red rashes and red spot as well as itchy skin.
As a matter of fact, the causes of these skin diseases are also quite similar, that is, little kids are not that "clean" due to too much sweat and saliva that but is not removed in time, so that the "covered" skin happens to diseases.
Podiatrist Tan Xiaohua noted that little kids have much more delicate skin as well as more heat production and sweat than adults.
Plus, the sweat gland of little kids is in the development, and the sweat gland and dermal gland of some children have not been balanced yet, leading to the inability to sweat.
"Some parents have a good habit by carrying a small towel with them and immediately wiping away the sweat on their kid once found."
"And for children often with wet clothes and sweat, skin rash will often be found on their body."
If the summer is too hot, babies will sweat too much, so parents can increase showering frequency for them and then put dry clothes on them.
For example, a shower for babies is taken every day at ordinary times, and now it can be increased to twice a day. However, flushing is just OK in the second bath, without the use of any bath supplies.
In addition, to prevent skin diseases in summer, anti-miliaria potion containing some herb ingredients like honeysuckle can be dripped into the bath water for babies, which can help disperse pore and perspire.
The above are essentials for parents to protect their kid's skin. For different skin diseases, parents can also adopt the following different treatment methods.
But keep in mind that if red rashes are accompanied with patches or repeatedly attack, it is recommended to see a doctor to check the possibility of other diseases.
"Keep any students from being deprived of education due to family financial difficulties" is our party and government's solemn promise.
The state places great emphasis on the efforts of funding the needy students by establishing a sound finance-aid system for college students covering multiple measures such as scholarship, loan, part-time jobs, allowance and tuition exemption
If students have questions, they can call the school in which they study first; if it doesn't work, they can dial the hotline set by relevant municipality or province and even the Ministry of Education.
She announced a flash marriage with the actor who worked with her ever on August 8, arousing great attention of society. Meanwhile, pictures of her smoking in the past were made public again, and even a startling inside story that she smokes a minimum of 40 cigarettes every day was disclosed.
Now, since Eikura Nana has just been married, many netizens believe that although she is now a grown woman who is not held liable for smoking, she had better quite smoking as soon as possible, or this will have a negative influence on her pregnancy in the future.
On August 12, the reporter learned from the Beijing Warning Center that Miyun District, Fangshan District and Pinggu District issued rainstorm red and orange warning signals in succession that day.
According to the Propaganda Department of the Miyun District Committee, Miyun District currently has shut down 34 tourism scenic spots and a submersible bridge in Daling Village, Beizhuang Town, has been destroyed.
At 10 am, August 12, Miyun District issued a rainstorm red warning signal and a geological disaster orange warning signal. And the rainstorm red warning signal was lifted at 2:30 pm.
It is estimated that there is still a thundershower or shower in Miyun District from the late afternoon to night that day, and mountainous areas and shallow mountainous areas will be at high risks of small and medium-sized river floods, mountain torrents, geological disaster and other secondary disasters arising from heavy rainfall.
Recently, Miyun District has dispatched 8,100 persons to be involved in the front line of flood prevention at district, town and village levels, and has evacuated 2,742 villagers across 164 villages to temporary shelters. The folk customs villages across the district stopped receiving tourists.
Additionally, the Pinggu District observatory issued an upgraded rainstorm orange warning signal at 12:50, August 12, and the Fangshan District observatory issued an upgraded rainstorm orange warning signal at 2:20 pm that day.
It is estimated that Fangshan District will still see a sustained rainfall and there will be geological disaster risks in mountainous areas and shallow mountainous areas.
And according to the Beijing Warning Center, an average precipitation measured by the rainfall monitoring stations across the city reached 20mm, with 13.7mm for urban area, from 6:00 am to 2:00 pm on August 12.
It is learned that at the time of the steam pipe break accident, more than 20 persons were working on thermal energy debugging on site.
Up to 3:30 am on the morning of August 12, the wounded persons were still in the ICU of Dangyang People's Hospital for emergency treatment.
Mr. Feng, a family member of the wounded person Luo Wen, said that 90% of his body has been scalded except hair and feet.
When Mr. Feng saw Luo Wen, he was unconscious due to serious injuries and doctors were saving his life.
It is understood that the five injured workers all suffer from scalding, some of whom are accompanied with injuries such as fracture.
Upon receipt of the accident report, the State Administration of Work Safety immediately dispatched a working group to rush to the scene of the accident, guiding and assisting local forces to make great efforts to carry out on-site rescue and accident handling.
Major leaders of the CPC Hubei Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government, together with leaders from the Hubei Provincial Safety Production Supervision Authority, also arrived on the scene to direct rescue operations after the accident.
According to the official, more than 17,700 people have been formally under arrest, over 11,500 people have been released, and more than 5,600 other people have been in custody.
It is learned that Turkey's rebel group attempted to launch a military coup on the evening of July 16 (local time).
The Turkish Government accused the opposition faction missionary Gulen of plotting an abortive coup attempt and requested the US to extradite him to Turkey.
Turkey's Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said later that his government has made a second request for extradition of Gulen to the US.
From the evening of August 11 to the morning of August 12, there were 2 explosions on Phuket Island, 1 in Surat Thani and 1 in the south of Trang other than 4 in Hua Hin, Agence France Presse said.
It was previously reported that the first bomb exploded at local time 10 pm, August 11, but no one was injured.
The explosion of the second bomb killed one Thai woman and hurt several foreigners and Thai people.
"Among the wounded persons there are 3 seriously injured persons and 7 foreigners including 4 women and 3 men," said local police.
After the accident, the Thai police evacuated the public and visitors near the explosion sites and sent the wounded persons to local hospitals.
At present, the Thai police are investigating the motivation behind the explosion cases and what kind of bomb has been used.
As a renowned seashore tourism city in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province, Thailand, Hua Hin attracts tons of domestic and foreign visitors every year.
Located about 200 kilometers away from the south of Bangkok, the city is a summer resort for the Thai royal household, where there are a number of beautiful beaches, national parks, historic sites and ruins of royal household.
On August 12, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the risk for visitors, who go to Brazil to watch the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and Rio Paralympic Games, to suffer from Zika virus infection or transmission is not high.
If athletes and travelers have to go to Brazil, preventive measures can be taken to avoid two ways of Zika virus transmission: mosquito bites and sexual transmission.
As of August 10, 66 countries and regions have reported the evidence of the mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission since 2015.
Some countries or regions reported the decreased number of Zika virus infection cases, but the outbreak of Zika has not shown a declining trend in general according to the evidences obtained at the present stage.
The WHO stated that although there have been Zika virus cases imported from overseas to the Chinese mainland, no local cases of human infected by mosquitoes have been found.
On August 12, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said that although he abused Philip Goldberg, U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, he would not make an apology to Goldberg.
On August 12, the U.S. embassy in the Philippines said in a statement that the US side has noticed the reports about the criticism on Goldberg and these remarks were "inappropriate and unacceptable".
During the election campaign of president of the Philippines this April, Goldberg criticized Duterte on the issue of human rights, and the two continued to accuse each other with sharp speech conflicts later on.
On August 12 Beijing Time, the Spanish men's basketball team saw a glimmer of hope of reaching the next phase after a tough 96-87 victory over Nigeria.
Oguchi got 24 points, including 7 of 12 three-pointers and all the 3 free throws made but no scores from the field, Akognon contributed 12 points and 5 rebounds, and Ibekwe scored 11 points and 5 rebounds.
As a traditional European team, Spain was severely weakened by the absence of its star player Marc Gasol, which had it on the ropes and even made it hard to advance from the group.
Facing the weakest competitor Nigeria in the group, Spain also played very hard and scraped through the game at the eleventh hour.
Within the last 1 minute 20 seconds in this quarter, Nigeria failed to score again, and Rodriguez hit a three-pointer to help Spain take a 25-11 lead into the first-quarter break after 5 straight points.
When there were 3'54'' to go in the second quarter, Gasol made a driving layup to help Spain hold the lead at 40-27.
When there were 6'09'' left in this quarter, Llull hit two free throws for a 61-48 Spain lead, a two-digit advantage once again.
After Oguchi's three-pointer for Nigeria, Spain scored 4 straight points to extend its lead to 14.
However, within the last 4 minutes 49 seconds in this quarter, Spain stopped scoring. On the contrary, Nigeria ended this quarter with a wave of 13-0 including points in the paint and outside shots for a 66-65 lead, the first in the whole game.
In this wave of attacks, Nigeria hit two three-pointers and a foul outside the three-pointer line.
When the game came to the last 3'49'', Nigeria closed to 79-81 after Aminu added a layup.
After Oguchi's another three-pointer helped Nigeria reduce the score disparity to 1, Reyes and Gasol who scored 6 straight points with free throws gave Spain an 89-82 lead as there were 1'15'' to go.
On the evening of August 12 Beijing Time, Beijing Guoan lost 1-2 to Chongqing Lifan at home in the 22nd round of the Chinese Super League.
After a short-term adjustment courtside, Yu Dabao returned to the pitch, but his trouble hasn't been cleared up. So, he was substituted by Song Boxuan in the 76th minute due to his inability to hold on later in the game.
What is more, Yu Dabao could not move by himself and was stretchered off. After a 10-minute treatment courtside, he was directly sent into an emergency ambulance.
As far as the "national football squad" is concerned, the possible injury of Yu Dabao will certainly affect China's competition for the Russia 2018 Asian Qualifiers that will kick off half a month later.
In a postponed Chinese Super League game held in this midweek, in which Guoan was held to a 0-0 draw by Evergrande away from home, Yu Dabao's neck has been injured after a fierce fight for a ball against José Paulo Bezerra Maciel Júnior, both of whom fell over at that time.
Also in that game, Yu Hanchao's serious injury made people more anxious. According to a conservative estimation, he needs a four-month recovery period, that is, he will at least miss the first half of the games for the top 12 Chinese football teams.
If Yu Dabao's injury is serious, the front-field staffing of China's national football squad will be greatly affected.
However, engineers from University of California, Berkeley, have advanced this concept and developed a tiny wireless sensor that can be used to monitor the health condition inside human body.
The researchers introduced their invention on the Neuron published on August 3.
On top of that, these battery-free sensors can be used to stimulate nerve and muscle.
This will probably offer a way to treat disorders such as epilepsy or activate human immune system.
This device has been implanted into the muscle and peripheral nerve of rats, and uses ultrasound as energy source, which is also used to read collected data.
This sensor has been compressed to 1 mm3, called "Neural Dust" which includes a piezo-electric crystal.
The author of this paper explained that the crystal converts the vibration of ultrasound emitted outside the human body into electricity to drive a tiny transistor, which is directly attached to a nerve or muscle fibers, inside the device.
Voltage peak in fibers causes changes of current circuit and crystal vibration, so that ultrasonic receiver (which currently is still the source that sends ultrasonic vibration) can detect echo.
Now that ultrasonic technology is very common in hospitals and ultrasonic vibration can penetrate most parts of human body, it seems to be a natural choice.
Michael Maharbiz is an associate professor of electronic engineering and computer science at University of California, Berkeley.
As the co-corresponding author of the paper, he said in a statement, "I believe that the long-term prospect of neural dust is not restricted to nerve and brain, but much broader."
Maharbiz, together with his colleagues and Jose Carmena, a neuroscientist at University of California, Berkeley, led the research.
"It was utterly impossible to adopt internal telemetry technology in the past, because a tiny object cannot be put into a very deep place," explained he.
"Now, however, I can take a tiny object and put it near nerve, organ, digestive tract or muscle, which then can read data."
To test their device, Maharbiz and Caarmena utilized six 540ns ultrasonic pulse sent per 100ms to drive sensor.
But the researchers feel quite confident that they can also work in the brain and central nervous system.
"The neural dust project is created with a vision of describing next generation brain-machine exchange and interaction and making it a feasible clinic technology."
"If a paralyzed patient hopes to control a computer or a robot arm, you can implant this electrode into his/her brain, where it can continuously work for a lifetime."
Since the two lenses work simultaneously, they can distinguish obvious front and rear landscapes, producing a more shallow depth of field.
In the wake of Kumamoto earthquake, not only local Japanese territory was damaged, but the world's core industrial chain of digital cameras was also broken.
Following the Kumamoto earthquake, Sony's plant in Japan suffered from heavy losses, causing the world's digital camera industry to be now in a situation of either short supply or rise in price.
Almost all the sensors developed by Sony are used for cameras. The absence of sensor supply means no cameras to be produced.
Recently there was news that Sony has currently raised approximately US$3.6 billion in the form of issuance of stocks and bonds for the R&D and production of stack CMOS.
The supply of sensors is nearly made possible by Sony, regardless of digital cameras or mobile intelligent devices (I can't image what would the scientific academia looks like if there was no Sony).
Compared to sources about new recording format revealed, I would rather prefer to see Sony can recover its normal supply of sensors, because today's camera prices are extremely high.
Macy's to close 100 stores
Department store giant Macy's said on Thursday that it plans to close 100 stores, a dramatic step that is aimed at helping the chain get ahead of a potentially crippling problem: America, it says, has too many stores for the online shopping era.
Macy's regularly prunes its store portfolio, often moving to close several dozen underperforming stores right after the annual holiday rush.
But in dropping a summertime announcement that it will close 15 per cent of its 728 locations, the chain appears to be adopting a more aggressive posture than many of its retail industry counterparts about girding its fleet for the reality of a fast-changing shopping environment.
Pedestrians and shoppers pass in front of a Macy's store in New York.
The retail giant has said it plans to close 100 stores.
Macy's has plenty of reasons to scramble to make a change: Many of its stores are located in small, regional malls, the kind whose foot traffic has been especially hard-hit by the rise of e-commerce.
And the department store category has generally struggled as shoppers increasingly turn to off-price retailers such as T.J. Maxx and fast-fashion players such as H&M to buy their clothes.
These factors, along with short-term hitches such as decreased spending by international tourists and unseasonable weather, have left Macy's in a rough patch that has stretched for more than a year.
On Thursday, the company said it saw a 2.6 per cent drop in comparable sales in the most recent quarter, a weak performance that was nonetheless an improvement over the dismal 6.1 per cent year-over-year decline it recorded in the previous quarter.
The retailer's revenue was $US5.87 billion ($A7.64 billion), down 3.9 per cent from the same period last year.
Macy's said the store closures would probably cost it about $US1 billion in annual sales.
And at one time, such a large batch of store closures might have been viewed as a retailer's concession of defeat.
Yet the company's stock soared 17 per cent on Thursday, a sign that investors view the move as a proactive measure that portends a stronger future for Macy's.
In some ways, it should not come as a surprise that Macy's is slashing stores.
Terry Lundgren, the retailer's chief executive, has said before that the chain simply had too many stores.
Executives have been saying for some time that they are embracing a strategy that puts particular emphasis on roughly 150 of their top-performing stores, trying to wring more sales out of those already-productive locations.
Jeff Gennette, the Macy's executive who has been appointed to replace Lundgren in 2017, said in a statement that nearly all of the stores the company plans to close are ones at which sales volume and profitability have been sliding.
"We recognise that these locations do not yield an adequate return on investment and often do not represent a customer shopping experience that reflects our aspirations for the Macy's brand," Gennette said.
The company said it would offer a list of the stores that will close at a later date.
Macy's said it is still finalising which stores it would shutter, and thus has not yet determined exactly how many jobs will be slashed.
The retailer will not pull out entirely of any of the top markets where it currently operates stores, but will look to close stores that are in weak locations.
The move is likely unwelcome news to mall operators, who count on big tenants like Macy's to attract and retain other smaller stores in their shopping centres.
Is your water bottle harbouring dangerous bacteria?
According to new research, drinking from refillable water bottle can be "many times worse than licking your dog's toy" in terms of the amount of bacteria it will bring you into contact with.
The website Treadmill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&K to test 12 water bottles of four different types - screw-top, slide-top, squeeze-top, and straw-top.
Each water bottle had been used by an athlete for a week without being washed.
Your refillable water bottle could be as dirty as a dog toy.
"Based on the 12 water bottles we tested, we found that reusable drinking containers may be crawling with an alarming number of viable bacteria cells: more than 300,000 colony-forming units per square centimeter (CFU/sq cm)," Treadmill Reviews said.
Slide-top were found to have the highest germ content, with more than 900,000 colony-forming units per square centimetre (CFU/sq) cm on average.
The bottles harboured gram-positive cocci, which can lead to skin infections, pneumonia, or blood poisoning.
Squeeze-top bottles were next-worse with 162,000 CFU/sq cm, and screw-top containers hosted just under 160,000 CFU/sq cm.
"Drinking from these bottles can still be worse than eating a meal from your pet's dish," the site added.
A far better picture emerged from tests on straw-top bottles, which were found to contain a fraction of the bacteria of other bottles - just 25 CFU/sq cm.
This may be because water drips to the bottom of the straw rather than sticking around to attract moisture-loving germs.
The germs that were present in the straw-top bottles were described as "mostly harmless."
"Based on our test results, we suggest opting for a straw-top bottle, both for the low prevalence of bacteria and the lack of harmful germs," the site said.
We also know that when it comes to water bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.
Additionally, water bottles without crevices and tough-to-clean spots are less likely to host germs.
The site advises readers to wash water bottles after each use, ideally with a weak bleach solution.
Religion must either modernise or face obsolescence
In the United States the Democratic Party recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.
If the results of the latest polls hold true at election time, America will swear in its first female president in January.
The previous week, across the pond, British Prime Minister Theresa May was negotiating the terms of Britain's exit from Europe with Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Women living in Western society have been raised to believe they can be competent and successful in any professional role through education, ambition and hard work.
And young girls today can point at several living role models operating at the highest levels of leadership.
So is the long and hard battle for women's equality finally over?
Hillary Clinton is poised to become president of the United States, but in the religious sphere women's leadership is still a contentious issue.
Well, not entirely.
In the religious sphere women's leadership remains a contentious issue.
Last week Pope Francis announced a new commission to consider whether women should be made deacons in the Catholic Church.
The Anglican Church consecrated Libby Lane as its first female bishop in January 2015, but this was only after a failed attempt in 2012.
While the Jewish Reform movement has been ordaining female rabbis since the early 1970s, and the Conservative movement since the early 1980s, in Orthodox Judaism the notion of female rabbis is still hotly contested.
In November 2015, the Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America - in its third attempt to stem the growing tide of support for Orthodox women's rabbinical ordination - published a stern proclamation declaring the illegitimacy of female rabbis.
Not without irony, as Hillary Clinton wrapped up the democratic presidential nomination a group of leading American Orthodox rabbis opposed to women's ordination launched a series of "hearings" on this disputed subject.
Why is there such disparity between the secular realm and the sacred?
Orthodox Judaism, like most religions, seeks stability in what it considers enduring traditional values.
This finds expression in resisting the pressure to conform to a changing society.
Those who oppose women's ordination do so on the basis that it is not "traditional."
But the obsession with maintaining tradition in this way is not without a cost.
And the cost of such single-mindedness can paradoxically be the undermining of tradition itself by depriving the traditional community of the oxygen it needs to remain vibrant.
In The Guns of August, a military history of the First World War, Barbara Tuchman highlights the danger of prioritising tradition in what has become known as the "tragedy of the red trousers."
In the lead up to WWI, as warfare shifted from fighting at close quarters to heavier artillery fired from greater distance, it become advantageous to conceal soldiers for as long as possible.
The British and German armies reacted to this change by exchanging their bright coloured uniforms for drab greys and browns.
The French soldiers, however, still wore the same red caps and trousers, marking them out as easy targets.
The suggestion of the French war minister Adolphe Messimy that his armies do likewise was met with ridicule and resistance.
The red trousers represented army pride and prestige and military traditionalists were not prepared to give it up.
At a parliamentary hearing, a former war minister, Eugene Etienne, spoke for France.
"Eliminate the red trousers?" he cried.
Never!
"That blind and imbecile attachment to the most visible of all colours," wrote Messimy afterwards, "was to have cruel consequences."
Faith leaders grappling with women's inclusion in religious leadership roles are in danger of the same pitfall.
By focusing exclusively on "what is traditional" for their religion rather than asking the crucial question: "What change is necessary for religion to thrive?" they risk alienating 50 per cent of their flock.
They also deprive the entire community of the talent, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise contribute.
Insisting that men continue to wear the trousers when it comes to religion might be traditional, but, as the pantalon rouge debacle illustrates, it may not be worth the price.
Dina Brawer is founder of JOFA, the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, in the UK and an Orthodox rabbinical student at Yeshivat Maharat in New York.
Charlton Athletic fan 'can only get season ticket if he signs behavioural contract' and agrees not to badmouth club on social media
Whilst we recognise that everyone is entitled to their own personal opinion, it is not helpful when inflammatory comments are posted on such websites.
The fan, who works in administration, was then told he would have to pick the ticket up in person from former police Chief Inspector Cliff Eager, who joined the club last month after a 35-year career in the police force.
The letter continued: "I need to advise you that the granting of your season ticket will be 'conditioned' and subject to you signing an 'Agreed Behavioural Contract' (ABC) which will request that you refrain from posting derogatory or inflammatory comments regarding the Club or people representing the club in the future on any social media websites, or carrying out any other form of behaviour that could be deemed to be on an anti-social nature."
Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after paying for his season ticket, which never showed up and two days later the letter arrived in the post.
Yesterday, he went to the meeting with the club and said: "They told me I had been tweeting excessively and causing other people to tweet as well - which is ridiculous.'
A cycling holiday down the Dalmatian coast
What do you mean, luxury?
I rode my butt off back there," says Colleen, a former US naval commander who has just completed a 25-mile bike ride along the spine of some rugged Croatian island and left nothing out there but a bucketful of sweat and a salvo of salty naval expletives hurled at the hostile hills.
Some cyclists sing hymns or recite nursery rhymes as a climbing aid.
Colleen's friend Patty recommends The Little Engine That Could.
Others count revolutions or just suffer in silence, wondering what it takes to enter the trance-like state of which hardened cyclists speak.
Colleen swears, with more venom than variety.
Cycling a few yards ahead of her is like being pursued by Hugh Grant in the opening sequence of Four Weddings and a Funeral.
Her mission and mine is a week-long "luxury" boat and bike tour of Croatia's north Dalmatian coast and islands, organised by Freedom Treks.
Cycling at the height of summer in such a steeply pitched place as Croatia might not fit everyone's idea of luxury, but north Dalmatia is said to be an easier ride than south, our saddles are soft and when we filled in our booking forms in carefree and confident manner all those months ago there was a box we failed to tick that could have secured us the assistance of a battery-powered e-bike.
The luxury part of the deal is our floating home for the week, the brand new Melody.
At the end of the ride we can dump our bikes on the quay for our guides Ivan and Ivana to stow, and jump off the back of the boat into clear blue water without having to mix it with sea urchins, sharp rocks and other people on the hanky sized strips of pebbles that Croatians call a beach.
In late June the sea is a perfect temperature, all agree: cool enough to refresh, but not cold.
The Melody is stocked with masks and snorkels and a couple of kayaks should anyone feel energetic after a hard morning in the saddle.
Instead, most of us retreat to our air-conditioned cabins where Helena, the ship's masseuse - I'm not joking - will have made our beds, restocked our minibars and left a new box of chocs on the table.
Ivan says stretching is important after cycling, and we practise stretching out for the afternoon on our beds or a cushioned lounger on the top deck with Antonio the barman ever ready to administer one of his cocktails.
The Melody, at 42m long with 15 cabins and a crew of half a dozen shipmates, is no bulging superyacht but a stylish little cruiser.
She turns heads in a small island port among the fishing boats and flotilla holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to her.
Colleen and Patty belong to a meetup.com group of friends from Washington DC: the Over 45 Sport and Socials, they call themselves.
Last year's barge and bike holiday in the Netherlands was such a success they decided to try something more adventurous and here they are in Croatia.
A rival chapel of their church is doing a boat and bike holiday in Provence, and every afternoon the ether thickens with a ping pong rally of competitive Facebook postings.
The adventure element of the holiday can be overstated, because our schedule is nothing if not regimented.
"Breakfast and dinner are at eight o'clock," Ivan announced to the new intake at the welcome briefing as we set sail from the beautiful old port of Trogir, near Split.
One ring of the ship's bell declares the buffet open and another at the end of the meal calls for silence and listen carefully to the next briefing.
"Good moaning!" is a cultural reference perhaps lost on all but the British contingent.
Who cares - the banter is well rehearsed and the jokes come thin and fast, while Ivana hands out sketch maps of the day's excursion and we all pretend to be horrified by the wiggles, contour shading and a profile with ups and downs on it, although anything else would be a surprise on a Croatian bike ride that starts and finishes at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," says Ivan.
Completely flat is not recommended.
Ivan delivers his briefing in parallel text, switching fluently between English and German.
Some weeks he has a dozen different nationalities to contend with, but we are an easy group - Swiss, German, American and British - which divides easily at mealtimes into two English speaking tables, one German.
On the road we are all friends.
Cycling breeds camaraderie, and the only competition is with the terrain, which is to say ourselves.
I can't remember a more harmonious and relaxed group dynamic.
We soon tune in to Ivan's wave length.
A stiff climb is an incline, not to be confused with an undulation, which is a good thing.
Hairpins are serpentines and straightforward means straight on: simple but not always easy.
Cycling instructions are always the same: "Single file, keep your distance, and it's not a race.
We meet on the quay at nine.
OK, five past - you're on holiday, I forgot.
Take lots of water.
From Trogir our cruise takes us northwards for two days through the Kornati archipelago, where we ride most of the length of Dugi Otok - Croatian for "long island" - and have our slumbers interrupted for a walk in the Telašćica Nature Park, to admire its high cliffs and a salt lake fed by sea water through an underground channel.
It is said to have rejuvenating power for all who swim in it.
If we paddle, will our legs feel younger and stronger?
At the small island of Molat we turn south again, hopping between mainland and nearby islands in seemingly haphazard fashion.
Most of our rides are on empty little roads through open country with big sea views and mixed veg: olive groves, vineyards, prickly herbal scrub; Mediterranean scents in the air and myriad butterflies on the wing.
While we roll along there is always a breeze but shade is at a premium when Ivan calls a halt, and small pools of it are the reward for early arrivals.
The Sport and Socials do a lot of group cycling at weekends and they know the etiquette, sending warnings up and down the line and leaving gaps so that motorists can overtake more safely.
"You were nearly a hood ornament there," one cyclist tells another, after a truck driver thought better of overtaking on a blind corner and hit the brakes hard.
Fortunately they worked.
Ivan divides us into three groups for the occasional short stretches of cycling on main roads, with Ivana at the very back to encourage and "scoop up," as Ivan puts it.
And if a main road must be crossed we all assemble, dismount and walk our bikes to the safety of the other side, as instructed and not before.
"Do you think Ivan realises he is not speaking to a group of children?" a Swiss cyclist asks, as we stand beside the road waiting for the signal to cross.
Our afternoons are not all devoted to idleness.
A city tour at Zadar reveals remains of a Roman forum and a sea organ which plays music like the moan of a caged sea monster, through pipes set in the stone fabric of the promenade and open to the water.
Zadar's famous sunset is perfectly timed between main course and pudding, and after dark we return to the sea organ and watch the play of wave-powered lights in a glass pavement - a dance floor, in fact.
When Melody sets sail for the lively resort of Biograd in the early morning, the organ's song is no more than a whisper.
Day five is entirely free of cycling.
A boat trip up the Krka river estuary to visit its waterfalls; an afternoon tour of Sibenik with its domed cathedral, a masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance; and a twilight stroll on the peaceful island of Zlarin in search of its local speciality, coral - make for an interesting day.
Lourdes prepares for pilgrims in shadow of attacks
People gather during the annual Catholic pilgrimage at the sanctuary of Notre Dame de Lourdes.
French security forces are on high alert as thousands of Catholics converge on the shrine of Lourdes for an annual pilgrimage unfolding in the shadow of a string of terror attacks.
Each year, tens of thousands flock to the sanctuary in the foothills of the Pyrenees for the Feast of the Assumption on August 15, marking the ascent of the Virgin Mary into Heaven.
This year's pilgrimage comes as Catholics reel from the killing of an elderly French priest on July 26 by two Islamist extremists, who stormed his church in northern France during Mass and slit his throat.
Jacques Hamel's murder came under two weeks after a Tunisian -- said by investigators to have become radicalised by online jihadist videos -- ploughed a truck into a Bastille Day crowd in the Riviera city of Nice, killing 85 people.
Many in France are now leery about attending public gatherings after three large-scale attacks in 18 months.
With tourist arrivals in the country plummeting, authorities had worried that the number of visitors to this year's pilgrimage would be sharply down.
But fears of mass cancellations have failed to materialise -- and some organisers say there has even been a last-minute surge.
Around 25,000 faithful are expected, including mass groups from Italy and Belgium and a delegation of around 200 members of the Eastern Orthodox branch of Christianity.
Many pilgrims say they will not be cowed.
"We're not going to stop living," Christian, a 66-year-old visitor, told AFP, describing prayer as the "only weapon" in the face of violence.
"It's important to show that life goes on," said Matthieu Guignard, one of the coordinators.
It's not because a few fanatics try to sow fear that we should abandon our faith, our beliefs, our way of living.
Several major events have been cancelled in France since the Nice attack over security concerns, including a huge flea market in the northern city of Lille and the European road cycling championships that had been set to take place in Nice in September.
"For the past week, my fear was that my phone would be ringing with cancellations," Fabien Lejeusne, the priest in charge of the official pilgrimage said last weekend.
Instead, the attacks appeared to mobilise the faithful, he said, reporting a last-minute bookings spurt.
The head of the local hotel workers' union, Christian Gelis, confirmed signs of "increased interest" in the pilgrimage in the wake of the attacks.
Security has been dramatically tightened around the sanctuary built around the shrine, where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared in a grotto to Bernadette Soubirous, a poor shepherd girl, in 1858.
Around 250 police and two dozen soldiers, including bomb disposal experts and officers with sniffer dogs, have been deployed to protect the area.
Pilgrims filing through security barriers have their bags searched at the entrance to the site, where the number of access points has been reduced from a dozen to three.
Catherine Simcox, who made a pilgrimage from the north east of England to Lourdes earlier this month described the heightened security.
"By Thursday morning, there were armed guards inside the sanctuaries and then the gates became single file entry (with metal barriers) with bags being searched on the way in," she told The Local.
"This total freaked my three kids out who are used to Lourdes & it was hard to not scare them when they asked why it was happening," she said.
It didn't spoil my experience, but it saddened me that it was necessary and I understood that some people were reassured by the measures.
The route of Friday's opening procession has also been curtailed -- instead of starting in the town of Lourdes and proceeding to the sanctuary, it will start and end at the shrine.
Other measures taken including shutting down the airspace above Lourdes to flights, closing off the streets around the sanctuary to traffic and replacing rubbish bins with transparent plastic bags.
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve is to inspect security arrangements on Saturday.
Lourdes attracts around six million people a year, making it one of the biggest sites of Catholic pilgrimage in the world.
Many visitors bring sick or disabled relatives, who come to bathe in a spring in the cave where Bernadette said she saw Mary, believing the water to have healing properties.
Thierry Castillo, another of the organisers, described this year's gathering as "a bit unusual" given "the threat that seems to have taken root in France."
But "it won't affect the quality and depth of what they experience," he assured.
Francoise, a 58-year-old volunteer who was assisting sick pilgrims, admitted she found the presence of soldiers in fatigues "a little overwhelming."
But if it reassures everyone, it's good.
Two injured in Zaragoza shopping centre shooting
Two people have been seriously injured after a man opened fire at a shopping centre in Zaragoza in northeastern Spain.
The incident occurred at 11am on Friday in the busy Aragonia commercial centre in Zaragoza.
Initial reports suggest that the gunman may have shot a woman, believed to be his ex-partner.
The gunman fled after firing the shots and is being hunted by police.
Turkey seeks missing diplomats following coup attempt
Turkey is seeking at least 32 diplomats who failed to return to Turkey in a recall of personnel following a July 15 coup attempt.
Foreign Minister Mevut Cavusoglu said Friday that 208 members of Turkey's ministry staff were recalled to Ankara from posts around the world in an inquiry regarding the coup attempt, and 32 remain missing "without permission."
About 18,000 civil servants, military leaders and academics have been arrested or suspended from their positions in Turkey, the government believing their loyalties lie with U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom it accuses of masterminding the attempt to overthrow the government.
Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is on Turkey's most-wanted list.
Cavosoglu said a U.S. Department of Justice team will visit Turkey later this month to discuss his possible extradition.
The issue has become a problem for the United States in its dealings with Turkey, a NATO member.
The United States has objected to the strong-arm tactics of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup, and Turkey has responded by attempting to develop closer ties with Russia.
Cavosoglu said two Turkish military attaches in Greece fled to Italy, an attaché in Kuwait attempted to escape to Saudi Arabia but was sent back and two generals in Afghanistan were caught in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He added two civil servants in Bangladesh fled to New York, and one in Russia went to Japan.
The Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryiet, citing military sources, added Turkey's military attaché in Jordan was also missing.
The Wall Street Journal, citing a U.S. official familiar with the situation, reported that a Turkish military officer stationed at a Virginia NATO command center requested asylum in the United States.
There are those who have escaped.
There have been escapees among our diplomats as well," Cavosoglu told broadcaster NTV in an interview.
As of yesterday, time has run out for those initially called back.
We will carry out the legal operations for those who have not returned.
Olympic officials try to clean green-tinged diving pool
Olympic divers planning to practice Friday arrived to a closed pool as officials took more time to clean the green-tinged water before holding the first individual event of the Rio Games.
The water suddenly changed color Tuesday, midway through the synchronized diving events.
Officials insisted the water was safe for competing, even after a larger, adjacent pool used for water polo and synchronized swimming also turned a lighter shade of green.
The diving well was shut down when athletes arrived for morning warmups, though it did finally open at 1 p.m. local time - just 2 1/2 hours before the start of the women's 3-meter event.
The water color appeared to be closer to normal but was still shaded green.
American diver Abby Johnston, who is competing on the springboard, said she showed up for her warmup, only to learn the pool was shut down without any notice.
She wrote on Twitter that "#FixTheSwamp" should start trending.
British diver Tom Daley, who won bronze in the synchro platform event, also commented on the state of the pool in a Twitter post.
Hopefully that means we haven't been diving in anything too bad the last couple of days!
Mario Andrada, chief spokesman for the local organizing committee, stressed that the pool was safe for competition, clearing the way for the 3-meter preliminaries.
He conceded that some athletes were bothered by the water, but said that was a result of efforts to clean the pool.
"We reiterate what we have been saying all along - the water does not offer any threat to the health of the athletes," he said.
In the first day of this water situation, one or two athletes complained about their eyes being itchy.
This was a result that the first reaction when we saw the water turning green was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - that is very common in swimming pools.
We reduced immediately the quantity.
We retested the water and it was totally within the parameters.
Simon Langford, chief spokesman for the Maria Lenk Aquatics Center, said the pool was closed to allow additional cleaning.
He said the decision was supported by world governing body FINA.
"The reason is that the water must be still so the pool can return to its blue color as soon as possible," Langford said in a statement.
Andrada said officials were caught off guard by the pool's deteriorating condition.
"Chemistry is not an exact science," he said.
Some things, as you can see, went longer than expected.
Rain the past couple of days made it even tougher to get the water color back to normal.
"The rain doesn't help," Andrada said.
He added that athletes had access to dry-land training in the morning, but conceded that "was not ideal."
He explained that the changing color of the pool was the result of increased alkaline levels, much like aquarium water can turn green when not monitored properly.
When we went to fix the green, there was a discussion about the best chemicals.
We can't use too much chemicals in the water because athletes are training in it," Andrada said.
We certainly could have done better in the beginning to prevent the water from turning green.
Once it turned green, we again made another bit of a mistake.

Thanks to U.S. stock market gains and yen devaluation overnight, Tokyo stocks opened higher on August 12, and Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.10%.
In the afternoon trading session, two major Tokyo stock indexes extended their gains, driven by a weaker yen and generally rising of other major indexes in Asia.
Seen from industry, the gains of stocks such as electrical industry, natural gas industry, aquaculture, and agriculture and forestry in the Tokyo stock market were at the very top, while stocks like banking obviously declined.
The places in both men's and women's singles finals were occupied by the Chinese players again. The powerful dominance of the Chinese team stirred up various cheerful jokes about the girly girl Fukuhara Ai online.
On the evening of August 12 Beijing Time, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced the report on the consultation with China in Clause 4, providing analysis and evaluation of China's economic and financial situation.
"China is continuing to switch to sustainable growth and have gained ground on many fields, but it also faces many challenges," said in the Chinese press release published on IMF's official website.
According to IMF's report, despite the decline in economic growth, China's contribution to the global economy in 2015 still accounted for up to one third. China's economic transformation is of benefit to the global economy.
IMF's executive directors commended China for its steadfast determination to enable a more balanced and sustainable economic growth, and noticed that China's economic growth is increasingly driven by services and consumption.
According to the National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China, China's service industry accounted for 54.1% of its GDP in the first half, and the contribution rate of consumption to economic growth reached 73.4%.
In enterprise debt, IMF's report suggests that comprehensive measures can be taken to address enterprise debt issues.
"Enterprises in industries with excess capacity have a larger pressure of debt repayment. De-capacity and de-leveraging today means to promote the gradual removing of debt risks," said Xu Gao.

Shanghai, Taipei to hold forum despite cross-Strait communication suspension
Shanghai and Taipei will hold their annual city forum from Aug. 22-23 in Taipei, Shanghai municipal authorities announced Friday, despite current suspension of cross-Strait communication mechanisms.
Senior municipal official Sha Hailin, on behalf of Shanghai Mayor Yang Xiong, will lead a delegation to attend the forum, the Shanghai government announced via its official microblog account on Sina Weibo.
The forum has been held by the two cities in rotation since 2010.
The 2016 forum will focus on exchanges in fields such as health care, smart cities, culture and transportation in a bid to "deepen exchanges and cooperation in various aspects" between the two cities, according to the Shanghai government.
The Taiwan side has failed to recognize the 1992 Consensus, which endorses the one-China principle, since new leader Tsai Ing-wen assumed office in May, leading to the suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.
Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office on the mainland, said Friday that the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations can be maintained as long as the Taiwan side adheres to the political foundation of the 1992 Consensus.
"We hold an active and open attitude toward exchanges between cities of both sides," Ma said, stressing that the nature of cross-Strait relations and city exchanges should be interpreted correctly.
Ugandan president meets Chinese FM, anticipates closer cooperation
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Thursday thanked China for its long-term support for Uganda's development and wished for closer cooperation while meeting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
China is an old friend of Uganda and Africa, who has sided with Africa during the continent's liberation from colonialism and later supported Africa's economic and social development, Museveni said.
The president cited the Tanzania-Zambia Railway built in the 1970s as an evidence of China's generous support even when China was by then not so prosperous itself.
China has carried out multifaceted cooperation with Uganda, ranging from infrastructure and business investment to cultural exchanges, Museveni said, adding that such kind of cooperation is more conducive to Uganda's long-term development than simply providing aids.
He hopes China can, through various ways, join in Uganda's infrastructural development and construction of industrial parks.
He also welcomes more Chinese to invest and travel in Uganda.
Wang Yi hailed the progress Uganda has made in industrialization and agricultural modernization, adding that China will continue to play the role of Uganda's most reliable and ideal cooperation partner.
China stands ready to try its best in helping Uganda pursue economic and social development, Wang said, noting that Sino-Ugandan cooperation is sincere and without any political strings attached as it is based on high-level political trust and time-tested friendship.
He said China would strengthen its cooperation with Uganda on construction of infrastructure and industrial parks, and support the east African nation to develop its energy and agriculture sectors.
28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind spirit with a big heart.
His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation.
He was the brother that went with the flow.
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.

Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.
The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS.
The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended.
He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.
But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also turned since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He's denied that emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of sorts.
For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has slumped by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.
They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.
"Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides.
It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the chief executive.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.
But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.
He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
I'm very emotional because my family are here as well
I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.
I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!
Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see.
He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.
It has been a rollercoaster ride.
Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban.
Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best.
And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.
Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but gave no reason.
Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
Later he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian).
On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.
Do the smiles convince?
This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.
So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?
No-one knows yet.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.
In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.
Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.
But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.
Mystery as fish land in Banff garden
A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500m from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
Happily, it all went very well.
Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Dynamic on vault.
Effortless on beam.
Jaw-dropping on floor.
Brilliant all over.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.
Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.
Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.
United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.
While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.
She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.
Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.
Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.
She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.
She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.
"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
Family tells the station he is expected to recover.
He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.
Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.
It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.
First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.
The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This is powerful.
Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.
These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, success in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.
To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government.
This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns.
If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."
Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.
Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.
If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.
And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period.
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report
A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today.
Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote.
Currently, a voter merely has to state their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.
Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.
He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting.
Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.
Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.
Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.
He also criticises the ineffectual "tick-box inspections" of town hall electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs.
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.
And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.
'I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe besides the facial hair,' Brady told Huffington Post.
'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.
Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor
Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.
Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
Floating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason behind the pair's similar looks
One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that 'the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.'
Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' could be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'.
Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.
Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'
Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.'
Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's broadcast apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.'
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf
CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.
We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.
That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'
'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'
Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.
To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'
She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'
Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.
'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'
'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.
'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: 'I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.'
'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.'
All the product in question has been removed from sale.
How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga
It's a dangerous world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.
Whether you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger.
If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'.
You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.
Sounds tricky?
Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.
Family of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction
A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.
She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.
There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.
This family are notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.
Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished
Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past
Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.
The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.
One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'
We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.
The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.
The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property
Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.
She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
'This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said.
Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is unfit for office.
Treats says nude calendar for 'women, as well as men'
Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s' Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they're setting out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We need to get back to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit pics online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Greenland shark is longest-living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of any vertebrate on the planet.

French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp.
They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.
A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."
The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.
"This 5,000-yuan subsidy solved the problem of my pressing need for money."
Zhou Fen, a girl who was registered in the poverty-stricken file of Mipo Village, Changle Town, Huayuan County, received the letter of admission from University of South China.
When she was worried about the tuition, the county committee of the Communist Youth League offered she a 5000-yuan subsidy on August 9.
Recently, the related county government department has provided a subsidy totaled 2.838 million yuan to over 690 poverty-stricken college students.
It also organized social fund-raising for students who are extremely poor in financial status to help them accomplish their study.
This year, Huayuan County integrated more than RMB 18.5 million of educational funds and self-raised more than RMB 2.5 million, which will be injected into the real-name bank accounts of the corresponding students.
"I thought my elder brother and I cannot afford the college study after my father passed away. It never occurred to me before the county government helped us so timely." She said gratefully.
As of August 8, Huayuan County had raised more than 21 million yuan of various relief funds this first half year for 13,140 poverty-stricken students.
All poverty-stricken students of the county that should be supported have been supported financially.
According to the reporter on the scene, a large container truck shifted to the fast lane with the command of a traffic policeman. Its container box fell down onto the green road, making a 2 cm deep pit on the road.
According to the Xinhua news agency, Australia's New South Wales government announced on the 11th day of the month that it will spend 200 million Australian dollars (about 154 million US dollars) to launch the biggest renovation on the famous Sydney Opera House since its establishment.
The New South Wales government said the renovation would not change the shell shape of the opera house.
The Sydney Opera House is one of Sydney's landmark buildings, designed by Danish architect Jorn Utzon and built in 1973. It welcomes about 8 million visitors each year.
Rory Jeffes, general manager of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes that the Sydney Opera House will make a "turnaround" via this renovation and become one of the world's concerts with the best sound effects.
Non-permanent residents who have lived in Beijing for more than six months and have a stable and legal employment or accommodation or conditions for continuous schooling in Beijing can apply for a residence permit.
Recently, the launch of implementation details of "Residence Permit Provisional Regulations" indicates that the "temporary residence permit" will be upgraded to "residence permit".
A responsible person of the relevant department said that the transition from the "temporary residence permit" to "residence permit" means that Beijing will shift its administration for non-permanent residents from the "management" to multi-directional services.
Today, a reporter learned from the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) that as of the end of June this year, the tax authorities at all levels have announced a total of 2,470 illegal "blacklist" cases.
It is understood that in July 2014, SAT took the first step in the central government departments to issue an Information Disclosure Methods For Major Tax Violations along with the Tax Credit Management Approach.
In addition to the illegal facts, legal basis, the handling and punishment of these cases, the basic information of the illegal parties and the relevant intermediaries will be included in the "blacklist" exposure.
Quality inspection, treasury, customs and other government departments also take relevant disciplinary measures against the "blacklist" parties.
"The credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and even the credit system of the whole society, which indicates that the construction of our social credit system is becoming more and more mature."
"Environmental problems are embodied by the atmosphere, water and soil pollution, but the root still lies in the mode of production and living."
For example, the land development ratio of Jiangsu Province was up to 21% in 2015, ranking top among all provinces and autonomous regions of China.
Therefore, the problem of high pollution, heavy energy consumption and land occupation has not been fundamentally addressed in the transformation of production and life styles.
On the one hand, Jiangsu tops in the whole country from the perspective of the establishment achievement of ecological environment of all levels and classes. But on the other hand, the resource and environment pressure is heavy.
To solidly promote the ecological environment protection and governance, we need to fundamentally promote the transformation of production and lifestyle and promote the transformation of people's livelihood from the perspective of ecological civilization construction.
On the 11th day of the month, 42 wind turbine blades produced by Guodian Group was prepared to be shipped and exported to South Africa from the wharf of Lianyungang Port.
Since last year, Guodian Group has exported a total of 163 sets of wind power projects from Lianyungang Port to South Africa.
The third party company (non-Chinese company) commissioned by the Olympic Organizing Committee is located in the Sao Paulo state, Brazil, about 75 kilometers away from the city of Sao Paulo.
To urge the manufacturers to finish the production ASAP, the Chinese Consulate General in Sao Paulo sent specially-assigned persons to the manufacturer for in-depth work.
After overtime work of 30 hours, the manufacturer finally completed the Chinese flag production and loaded for transportation. The task was finished 4-5 working days in advance.
It is reported that the flags are expected to arrive in Rio on the 11th. Then the Olympic Organizing Committee will send the flags to various Olympic venues after receiving the flag. The whole process will be under the supervision of the Chinese embassy in Brazil.
(This newspaper) On the 10th day of the month, the Nantong Municipal Government held a series of cooperation activities at the Shanghai International Convention Center. More than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate. More than 20 Hu-Tong industry docking projects worth at least RMB 100 million saw on-site signing.
The 20 projects with simultaneous signing have a total investment of RMB 8.063 billion, involving new energy, new materials, modern services and other industries.
Qingdao is China's 12th and also Shandong's first trial city to use and trade emissions.
On the 11th day of the month, many companies came to the Qingdao Municipal Emissions Trading Center to submit emissions subscription. After acceptance, they shall pay fees.
The upcoming first single transaction also indicates that Qingdao emissions trading pilot officially kicked off. It will also be the first emissions trading in Shandong and the first city-level emissions trading in China.
In the morning of 11th day of the month, Zhao Xiuping, the General Manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Fine Chemical (Group) Co., Ltd. came to the trading center to submit emissions subscription.
Its plant in the old urban area of Qingdao came to a full halt and was moved to the new plant in Pingdu due to environmental reason.
After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form and the construction project environmental impact report, etc., Qingdao Municipal Emissions Reserve and Trading Service Center began to review the application materials.
According to the collection standard determined by Qingdao price bureau and financial sector, the estimated initial emission fee is about 641,200 yuan. The working staff will finish review within 7 working days.
The upcoming first single transaction also indicates that Qingdao emissions trading pilot will officially kick off. It will also be the first emissions trading in Shandong and the first city-level emissions trading in China.
According to Zhao Xiuping, up to RMB 400 million has been invested in the current environmental protection. Such investment has a great impact on the enterprise management philosophy and social benefits and also opened up a space for the enterprise innovation management.
On the same day, Qingdao SF-XC-ZZ Coach Component Co., Ltd. also came to purchase emission rights for its project with an annual output of 4,200 interior accessories of high-speed rail and CRH.
The project is a mechanical processing enterprise. Its initial emission rate for the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia (NOX) are 0.514 tons/year and 0.052 tons/year, respectively.
The paid use and trading of Air Pollutant Emission Permits cover the city's key industrial enterprises for the production and supply of electricity and heat.
On January 1, 2016, the current pollutant discharging unit which obtained environmental impact assessment shall be exempt from expenditure of compensated use.
The obtaining of compensated emission right is not equal to the obtaining of illegal discharge, so companies cannot discharge pollutants at will.
Han Hongyan, deputy director of Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau, introduces that companies of illegal and excessive sewage must be punished in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations. Illegal enterprises cannot be allowed to circumvent punishment via purchasing emission rights.
In other words, we need to crack down on environmental violations through legal means and severely punish the enterprises' over standard discharge behaviors, so as to protect the environment and public health.
Now for their own interests, enterprises have raised their enthusiasm of pollution control, cherished limited emissions and reduced emissions of pollutants.
With the economic interests drive, to reduce pollutants' discharge has shifted from the government's mandatory behavior into a conscious market behavior, so as to truly protect the environment, nature and public health.
Emission right, also known as "dumping right", means the right to discharge pollutants. It refers to the right for emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment in line with the law within the quota assigned by the government.
This right is essentially the right of the emitters to occupy, use and benefit from environmental capacity resources.
Next, under the premise that the total discharge of pollutants does not exceed the total allowable emission volume, the internal resources of pollution began to swap discharge capacities via currency exchange.
Since the proposition of emissions trading by American economist Dyers in 1968, it has been applied by the United States of America to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources since the 1970s.
Since its pilot in China in 2007, it has been applied to 14 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu.
According to the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in order to assist the air attack of the six strategic bombers on the "Islamic State" target in Syria, a number of Russian fighters lifted from the Syrian Mahmir Air Force base to provide support.
On February 22 this year, the United States and Russia reached a ceasefire agreement on the Syrian conflict. The ceasefire agreement will be implemented since February 27.
Under the agreement, the ceasefire does not include a military strike against terrorist organizations including "Islamic State" and "Salvation Front ", which were identified by the United Nation Security Council.
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure in the base and the living conditions of the Russian soldiers will be protected correspondingly.
He also said that if the extremist forces were not hit, these forces will be extended to Russia.
Although Russia and the West did not reach an agreement on the cooperation against the extremist forces of Syria, Russia would strengthen cooperation with Syria, Iran and Iraq in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia, at the invitation of the Syrian government, began a military strike against Syrian extremist forces.
On March 15 this year, Russia's major military forces began to evacuate, but the Russian side promised to continue to retain the military base in Heimi Mimi and the naval base in Tartus.
In the case of renovating old houses and successful startup in his hometown, He Peijun is making a good example: to inherit a 100-year old house and tell a story about the land heritage.
Today, 100,000 people on average visit Zhushan each year, bringing a variety of ideas or seeking inner peace.
In fact, the relationship between the village and the city should companionship with, just like mother and child. No matter strong or weak. There is no need for any party to be governed by the other party. Such a relationship is warm.
There is no fixed pattern of rural development, but it is quite difficult to just rely on spontaneous rural changes. One of the most important changes is to let the right people go to villages.
Shanghai Songjiang District Traffic Control Department recently used electronic police to monitor whether the driver plays mobile phone while driving. As a result, more than 30 cases were detected in a week.
With the popularity of smart phones, mobile phones become more and more funny. WeChat, microblogging and even games, shopping on Taobao have become normal. It seems that many people cannot leave the phone for a moment, and cannot stop even when driving.
According to "Road Traffic Safety Act", mobile phones playing are banned and defined as "behavior preventing safe driving".
Unfortunately, due to some reasons such as the large number of illegal cases and difficulty in obtaining evidences, those people have never been punished and make the laws become a kind of decoration.
If the traffic control department can be determined to declare war to the mobile phone playing behavior while driving and normalize such measures, such illegal behaviors will surely be curbed.
The public security organ shall be strict with household registration management by gradually establishing electronic and paper files for people without Hukou (household registration) and ensure the completeness and validity.
The public security organ shall promptly notify the relevant departments of the registration of people without Hukou.
The policy measures that are inconsistent with the idea of this implementation will receive a centralized cleanup. They should be corrected and abolished if necessary.
In the collective greenhouse of Donglin village of Taicang City, the 48-year-old Wang Xuefen is leading workers to pear spray pesticides on pear trees.
There are 150 acres of orchards and more than 10 species, but only 12 workers plus a technical engineer are ok.
Last year, the income was a total of RMB 50,000. I cannot earn so many if i work in the factory because of such age.
Last year, the income of Donglin village reached RMB 22 million, of which total agricultural income accounted for nearly a half.
According to Su Qifang, the village secretary, per capita land cultivation area increases each year. 50 mu (a unit of area, one "mu"=0.0667 hectares) in the beginning and over 100 mu now. The revenue per mu increases every year and the income of professional farmers also have room for growth every year.
With shares quantifying to each villager, the highlight of the rural collective economic reform is to be clear about the property rights of rural collective management and exploring political and economic separation.
In July 2015, on Anzhen Street of Wuxi Xishan District, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations worked with the village committee to implement "sub-account management". The village committee implemented rural public affairs management while the cooperative organizations were mainly engaged in business.
With two accounts for two institutions, this can prevent the village cadres from participating in collective asset management corruption.
Zhu Baoping, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Agriculture Committee, said that the next step of Jiangsu government is to continue to promote the reform of community cooperation system, encourage farmers to jointly develop and establish a village-level democratic power operation mechanism.
According to Zhu Baoping, they should further move forward the reform, engage in community shares cooperation, quantify the assets to members, fix it to farmers and produce clear property rights.
Through the Internet +, we shall provide farmers with the rights to know, participate in decision-making and democratic management and turn such rights into standardized mechanism of cooperation.
At present, the new collective economy in southern Jiangsu village mainly consists of four development modes, including asset leasing, enterprise stock, agricultural development and joint development.
It is understood that overseas exhibitions have become important platform for the "Belt and Road Initiative" development.

Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: "handsome hands" encourage her to start shooting career, which saw several "reverse"
Zhang Donghong, a villager of the East Park Village, Xiamen Xiang'an District, changed his 29-inch old TV into a 65-inch TV just a few days before.
The ordinary farmer has a daughter, named Zhang Binbin. She is the one to win sanzi final silver medal of Olympic Games Women's 50-meters rifle games for China in the evening of the eleventh.
In the evening of the 11th day of the month, just in front of this new TV set, the Zhang Donghong couple and their dozens of relatives and friends have witnessed the magic process for the couple's daughter to catch up and reverse from almost being eliminated in the preliminaries to almost winning.
At the game, Zhang Binbin was ranked in the middle and lower reaches and it seemed she was still quite far away from the final.
But her parents and friends did not give up, kept watching the live and saw other players finish the game. Zhang Binbin raised her ranks all the way and finally came to the final. At this time, a burst of cheers broke out in her home.
In the final, Zhang Binbin also started from lagging behind and shot more stably and won the silver medal with just 0.2 rings behind the champion.
This year, the 27-year-old Zhang Binbin, in the 16-year shooting career, has actually missed the silver medal for several times.
According to her mother Zhang Xiaolong, her daughter sent a few "little persuaders" from her village at their hesitation.
These little persuaders are girls and boys of her village who were recommended to attend the training at the same time, including Zhang Binbin's cousin.
Just after coming to Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again took the initiative to return to Xiang'an school because of her family difficulties.
But after the repeated efforts of her enlightening teacher, Zhang Binbin returned to Xiamen team.
And after she came into the provincial team, Zhang Binbin returned home because she found it almost hopeless to enter the national team after a long time.
This time, not only the coach Zhang Yajie, but also the leaders and coach of Xiamen shooting archery sports center and Fujian provincial team came to her home. With their efforts, Zhang Binbin was finally persuaded to return to the provincial team.
Just at yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl achieved several reversals of the shooting with her insistence.
"Each coach has his own method to choose the potential player. I decided to take her once I saw her beautiful hands."
Zhang Donghong also recalled, in the training test, although the results of her daughter were not the best, her rings were very stable, which is also an important reason for Zhang Binbin to attract coaches.
During the training process of Zhang Binbin, it was the input of this farmer girl that impressed Zhang Yajie most.
He recalled that after Zhang Binbin came into the Xiamen shooting team more than a year later, the team carried out a long shot of gun training, requiring players not to move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well-behaved child, with the hobby of painting and producing toys.
"I used to make clothes and do some sowing jobs. Binbin picked up some scraps to make her own dolls."
She said, her daughter often sewed hand toys. Plus, she is good at painting and could make animated toys from the doll's facial features to clothing.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and her family are separate more than being together. As she can only return home during festivities, she mainly contacts family members by phone in other time.
According to her parents, no matter meeting in person or talking by phone, Zhang Binbin seldom talked about her hard work but more about some happy things.
Because they cannot often see their daughter, they put away the paintings of her childhood and honors of consecutive years.
Zhang Xiaolong showed the animation show of her daughter to the reporter, "She should keep drawing instead if she did not become shooter."
In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin, there was a cupboard filled with medals and certificates.
Zhang Donghong put away the medals neatly and placed all certificates into files for storage. "This is honor made by Binbin after a dozen of years' efforts. We feel quite cherished."
Recently, Hebei Cixiao Fund sent a 16,000-yuan relief sent to six families who lost their relatives in Xiaozuo, Taitou and Guiquan Village of Jinjing County.
This is another condolence and care activity after the fund association releases the call for finding "bereaved children and lonely old men causued by the flood disaster in July 19, 2016".
The 719 heavy rainfall caused heavy disaster to many cities of Hebei Province and resulted in the flood disaster of some regions in Hebei province. During the period, some people were dead and missing.
The good man "Lao Tie" sacrificed his life when he helped the community on drainage, leaving a 2-year-old kid and a wife with child. The moving story of the good man "Lao Tie" made the entire provincial capital moved.
On August 4, the working personnel of Hebei Provincial Cixiao Fund and volunteers of Hebei Brand Association came to his home and offered his relatives with 3,200-yuan love donation.
When Ye Li, the vice president of Hebei Brand Association acknowledged the situation of "Lao Tie", they immediately decided to carry out "love charity" activities among enterprise members to help "old iron" family to ride out the storm.
Hebei Provincial Cixiao Fund, known as Cixiao Fund of the Hebei Volunteer Service Foundation, was initiated by the Hebei Brand Preparatory Committee, and established in August 2015.
According to a Hong Kong Oriental Daily report made on August 12, the current diamond sales in Mainland China were accused of three major problems, including the false marking of diamond clarity to raise sales price, false diamond weight and unguaranteed aftersales, etc.
Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers. The diamond cutting technology of local artisans is well-known. All diamonds on sale have undergone rigorous identification, deeply welcomed by the mainland ladies.
"A small cloth bag, holding in one's hand, such light-weighted, is worth of almost one million yuan", a woman surnamed Liu who participated in the purchase of diamonds told of her experience in Antwerp last June to the mainland media.
She buried the diamond in her lingerie and carried it all day along, including when she went to toilet and took bath.
She said the diamond she bought in Antwerp was priced about RMB 55,000 per gram and diamond of the same quality was retail-priced about RMB 111,000 in Xia'men.
Recently, she sold the diamond with 120% more than the price she bought and earned two hundred thousand yuan.
According to the provisions of the Mainland Customs, diamonds are neither supplies nor necessities during the trip and thus belong to the scope of goods. So such diamond should be declared at entry and exit. Otherwise, it shall be classified as smuggling. People may be sentenced to jail.
According to foreign media reports, on the 10th day of the month of the local time, the British Prime Minister's Downing Street announced that British Prime Minister Teresa Mei will go to Switzerland to spend the summer vacation, but did not disclose the specific place.
According to some media, after the British referendum off Europe, the new British Prime Minister chose to spend her vacation on the "neutral country", Swiss on the European continent. This is symbolic.
The British "Guardian" commented that the symbolic neutrality nature of the Swiss played a role in the choice of the British Prime Minister's first resort.
British "Daily Telegraph" commented that Teresa Mei chose to take a vacation in Switzerland. This is the first time that the British Prime Minister chose to go vacation in Swiss after Margaret Thatcher.
The choice of these two female prime ministers is quite a contrast to the hot place which Blair and Cameron, the two male prime ministers like to go to.
It is reported that the new British Prime Minister Teresa Mei will return to London on August 24. A series of important work and activities will be waiting for her.
The British parliament will resume on September 5. The subject matter covers the second Brexit referendum required by the internet.
On June 23, the British held a referendum for Brexit, but the British new prime minister did not want to start the article 50, which is involved with the Lisbon Treaty before the end of the year.
There are 1,325 existing intangible cultural heritage projects in Huangshan. Its number and quantity ranked first in Anhui province.
As the inheritance of intangible cultural heritage projects of Anhui province mainly relies on oral and face-to-face passage, many intangible cultural heritage projects are on the verge of failing to be handed down from past generations. So the application of digital technology for conservation is imperative.

China's Mars program is coming
China Mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding, landing and patrolling at one time, which has never occurred in foreign countries.
China's Mars exploration launch target is to step around, land and patrol at one time. Such task has considerable difficulty.
Because the Mars probe can encounter a time window in 26 months, experts are closely working on the project plan and try to launch the first Mars probe in 2020.
According to Xu Dazhe, although China's aircraft has entered a deep space, it is still essential to finish the task of Mars exploration. The detection of Mars means that China has stepped into the deep space exploration era in a true sense.
"Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth. And at this point, it is most energy efficient to launch the vehicle."
"Taking into account the mass of Mars detectors, it will be the job of China's Long March 5 carrier rocket to complete the launch mission."
China's Mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding, landing and patrolling at one time, which has never occurred in foreign countries. There was one time of surrounding and landing before in foreign countries, but the landing failed.
Mars exploration involves a lot of technical areas. In particular, although the rover is a space detector, it has a distinctive feature compared with the general space detector.
In other words, the Mars probe should be capable of determining the driving route and equipped with the ability to find obstacles.
According to Pang Zhihao, a researcher of the fifth institute of China's Aerospace Science and Technology Group, the reason for human being to favor Mars exploration is because Mars detection has significant scientific and technical meanings and it even matters to the future of human beings.
Currently, the Mars has become the planet with the highest degree of human research. The history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration.
Therefore, the human beings hope that one day on the Mars to establish a base of residence, and ultimately to Mars immigration, it turned into a second home of mankind.
A large number of signs also show that the Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth, only after billions of years of evolution into the atmosphere thin, low temperature, water depletion and so on.
Therefore, the detection or manned landing on the Mars for research can help propose a pre-arranged planning to prevent the earth from becoming the second Mars which is difficult for human beings to inhabit.
As of June 2016, the world conducted a total of 114 lunar explorations, including 43 Mars detection missions.
However, ever since the 1990s, a total of 18 human explorations have been carried out and only 14 lunar detections have been conducted.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rovers at work, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are at work.
World space powers have developed a detection plan with the Mars system as target. So we can see the current Mars detection is hotter than that of moon detection.
On Nov. 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars probe "Mangalian", and has become Asia's first country for successful detection of the Mars.
"Mangalian" is used to study the surface, the atmosphere and mineral characteristics of the Mars and explore whether there are signs of methane and life on the Mars.
The hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the Martian atmosphere for aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration.
According to Sun Zezhou, the chief designer of a Mars detector of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Mars exploration task is confronted with many technical challenges.
The atmospheric pressure of the Mars is very low, only 1% of the Earth's surface atmospheric pressure, with high uncertainty.
Scientists have not had a thorough understanding of Mars factors such as its changes and storm characteristics.
A dust storm similar to the Earth's dust is often formed in the Mars in the summer, which will lead to a sharp decline in solar energy. So a "sleep" mode must be designed for the Mars rover and let it wait patiently until the disappearance of dust storms.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a problem for the energy supply for Mars detection.
This requires that the detector's sun wing area to be larger, and need to constantly adjust, and strive to align with the sun direction.
In addition, since the gravity of the Mars is only 38% of that of the earth and much higher than that of the Moon surface, so the probe requires higher power.
"The core and the most difficult part of the Mars exploration mission are the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration process after the probe enters Martian atmosphere. There is just one chance to ensure success."
According to Sun Ze, it must rely on the detector to complete the entire process because the distance between the Earth and the Mars is quite large.
Because there is not so much propellant to offset the high speed, the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing the Mars. However, it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth.
Pang Zhihao said, in general, the way to detect the Mars is similar to the way to detect the moon. The entire process is also "surrounding, landing, patrolling and returning" to achieve the goal of manned landing on the Mars.
Because the distance between the Mars and the earth is larger than that between the Moon and Earth, it needs to overcome a series of more complex technical difficulties before the Mars detection.

Original title: Suit launched by "corridor doctor" Lan Yuefeng against CCTV host Wang Zhi'an for reputation infringement fails in instance judgment
The legal evening news: Because the CCTV host Wang Zhi'an published his remarks against the "corridor doctor" event on microblogging, Lan Yuefeng brought Wang Zhi'an and Beijing Micro Dream Chuangke Network Technology Co., Ltd. to the court.
Yesterday afternoon, Haidian court sentenced the case and the verdict said that Wang Zhi'an and Micro Dream Company did not constitute the infringement and dismissed the Lan Yuefeng for all the claims.
At the beginning of 2014, CCTV reporter Wang Zhi'an found after his survey that although Lan Yuefeng was sitting in the corridor for more than 600 days and was shaped as the tragic hero suppressed by the media, these reports had a lot of false information.
On March 29, 2014, the "corridor doctor" program produced by CCTV news survey broadcasted.
All information about the so-called over-medical treatment reported by Lan Yuefeng to the media do not have any evidence support.
In the microblogging with real-name certification, Wang Zhi'an also said that the reason for Lan Yuefeng to become this is because of his stubborn characters and paranoid personality".
Lan Yuefeng claimed that Wang Zhi'an should delete the microblogging and apologized to him and made compensation of 100,000 yuan for the mental damage solatium.
At the time of the trial, the two sides argued whether Wang Zhian violated the reputation right of Lan Yuefeng.
Highlight of the 12th day of the month: at the beginning of Track and Field Events, the Chinese team is quite busy and the women's football association aims to become the top four of the bicycle games
The bicycle game is expected to realize the "zero breakthrough" in the Olympic gold medal while the Women's World Cup girls will challenge Germany team, the world champion winner for twice and are expected to become the top four.
Wang Zhen was quite outstanding in the two races. He won silver medal for the athletics world championship held in Beijing last year and was upgraded to the individual project champion in the world championship this May.
According to foreign media reports, Zhang Huizhen, the 27-year-old Korean archery female player won the gold medal in the women's archery individual tournament. This is the second scoring of Olympic gold medal following the team competition. This made she become a double winner.
Zhang Huizhen is considered as a late bloomer. She regrets about not winning the last session of the London Olympic Games tickets before, but now she proudly stands on the top of the Rio Olympic podium.
Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in Lisa Wenglu, a total score of 6-2 in the women's archery finals at the Samba Boulevard in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
She did archery for the first time in the fourth grade of primary school. She won the first individual tournament gold medal when she was 27 in 2014. So she is a late bloomer.
Zhang Huizhen recalled, "My performance before high school was too bad to enable me to participate in the national competition.
Zhang Huizhen was ranked the fourth at the London Olympic Games qualification trials. Unfortunately, she lost the Olympic admission and can just watch her colleague and good friend Qi Pubei score two gold medals.
Zhang Huizhen talked about his gold winning after the women's individual awards ceremony of archery. "I tried to shoot one by one until the last. Maybe it is because this brings me good results and makes me contented."
The 28-year-old Korean archery "No.1", and the London Olympic Games archery individual tournament winner Qi Fubei won the bronze medal.
Qi Fubei was defeated by Zhang Huizhen in the semifinals and competed for the bronze medal with the Mexican player Alexandra Valencia.
Qi Fubei shed tears after she knew she won the blonde medal. At this time, we can know her pressure.
Firstly, the coaching staff accumulated rich experience in his gradual study. Secondly, it needs scientific training, which should be accumulated over time.
The Archery team helped the team players focus and remain unbiased via military training and going through the cemetery during night.
Although not yet confirmed, it is said by many sources that Apple's 2016 autumn conference will be held in September, and iPhone7 would really be launched into the market.
Although Apple did not respond, there are news release about the function and configuration of the new iPhone. There are even the images of iPhone7 "real machine model" on the internet.
The new generation of iPhone is really "eye-catching", hot and hard-to-get. If you want to buy the genuine product at the first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suning.
This has exacerbated people's disappointment of the new iPhone, "It is lengthened, but cannot be used to cast holographic images! This generation of iPhone is so terrible."
iPhone7, just like other iPhones, brings countless secret before birth.
In addition, there are a number of sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will have the 3.5mm headphone jack cancelled, and adopt Bluetooth connection and charging interface instead, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker.
Another evidence to support this news is that as early as 2014, Apple will allow headset manufacturers to produce headset products via producing charging interface.
Another evidence to confirm this message is that Apple allows the headphone manufacturer to produce headphone via the connection of charge interface.
Whether these news are true or false will not be unveiled until the 2016 Apple autumn conference.
But this does not prevent the industry insiders to be optimistic about the prospects of iPhone7 - many people think that iPhone7 will be likely to become the last major upgrade of Apple's iPhone series, although it can be seen from the data released by the market research institution IDC that the market share of iPhone will decline to some degree.
Among them, Goldman Sachs ranked Apple's stock to be the rating of "buying" while BMO analyst thought that iPhone7 will obtain a historical high sales achievement.
Meanwhile, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple's future revenue growth will likely be more than 20%, which is entirely due to the introduction of iPhone7.
7% of respondents said they have the plan to buy iPhone7, while only 4% people had the plan to buy iPhone6.
It is understood that currently 20% of user groups of iPhone6 or 6Plus have such a plan to purchase iPhone7. This is a quite high proportion.
Secondly, according to expert analysis, most of the iPhone fans like to replace their own iPhone mobile phone.
According to statistics, among all iPhone users, about 26% of users have not changed their phones for 2 years. That is, almost 120 million users of iPhones have been using the same iPhone for 2 years.
According to media, Taiwan witnessed several earthquakes during the production period of iPhone7. "The destruction of TSMC production facilities is beyond imagination and may impact the initial supply of iPhone7."
Supply and demand contradiction will affect the average user, so it is time to choose a good channel and purchase the genuine iPhone7 for the first time.
According to informed sources, recently, Suning executives and Apple frequently meet, with the purpose to prepare adequate supply.
Operators have negotiated with Suning. So it is foreseeable that, with the depth of cooperation between the two sides, lower prices and more intimate services will inevitably bring to users.
"With the lowest price, the consumer may "buy iPhone7 with just 7 yuan per day".
Adequate supply and a variety of concessions will alleviate the pressure of iPhone7 buying. Suning's logistics will change such good feeling into more intuitive sense of experience.
Maybe you'll get a call at midnight. "Hello, Suning Tesco, your iPhone7 is here."
The organizers hope that the local people can understand more about the history of Chinese culture via the cultural relics exhibition, thereby enhancing the mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
As part of the European tour, Barcelona's "Ming Dynasty Heritage Exhibition" will continue until early October.

According to foreign media reports, the "green pool" incident of Rio Olympic Games gained much attention because its diving pool water was changed from blue to green.
However, on the morning of the 10th day of the month, the water of the match pool adjacent to the water pool also turned green.
Australian water polo contestant said that his eyes feel tingling and would like to shed tears.
Previously, Rio officials confirmed the situation of water greening, and said the water color is due to the weakening of alkaline reasons and will not affect the athlete's health.
However, after Australian players achieved success with the Japanese delegation in the water polo pool, they said their eyes felt pricking.
When the water of diving pool turned green, the hosting party worked overtime to deal with the diving pool problems in the evening of the 9th day of the month and found the rapid change of water polo pool in the morning of the 10th day of the month.
During the competition period of the Australia and Japanese team, the environmental conditions of the water polo pond gradually worsened, but the official stressed that they would manage to return the water quality of the two pools to their original colors on the 11th day of the month.
Mario Andrada, the spokesman of Rio Olympic Games said, "The alkalinity of water quality in the diving pool firstly turned weak after the yesterday afternoon".
"We learned about a series of causes that could cause discoloration of water and result in the alkalinity of water quality."
The water sports center conducted a series of tests on water quality, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the swimming pool to determine whether the water quality meets criteria. "
"We have been following the normal procedure these days, but we may have overlooked the impact of more athletes on water quality."
"But the change in water color certainly has no effect on health, especially for athletes."
"This independent team confirms our assessment and confirms the measures we have taken to restore the normal color and normal chemical status of the pool."
"We had hoped that the pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by the rain."

Urumqi normalizes the operating order of travel tourism market and regulates that travel agencies must sign contracts with tourists
Currently, Xinjiang has entered peak tourist season. In order to regulate the management order of tourism FIT market, yesterday Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment worked with the law enforcement detachment of Urumqi Transportation Authority to investigate and deal with the non-normative travel vehicles existent in the tourism FIT market, and the low contract signing between the travel agency and tourists.
At 8 O'clock of yesterday morning, around 10 buses packed with tourists parked around the Kempinski Hotel. These vehicles are mostly individual group that went for Tianchi One Day Tour.
"Hello, I am from the Urumqi City Tourism Bureau. Did you sign with the travel agency?"
Yu Bin, the working staff of law enforcement detachment of Urumqi Transportation Authority explained, "The foreign tourist bus and bus line worked on tourist transport project in Urumqi market, but they did not have qualification."
"A fine of 30,000 to 100,000 yuan will be imposed for operation beyond scope. The driver who did not have a qualification certificate will pay RMB 2,000 for fine."
It is reported that the Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Department has investigated the places including West Park and Hongshan where the independent travelers are centralized.
After integrating the inspection twice, Ma Qi, the deputy head of Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment said that, "Safety first, norm second. No small matters for the travel vehicles. And people will be injured and killed in groups in case of any questions."
"The management and we have made continuous inspection on the market to normalize the car use behavior of tourist agency to ensure the safety of tourists."
On the morning of August 12, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016.
Sheng Yunyun, spokesman of National Bureau of Statistics and head of National Economic Statistics Division said that, in July, the part index number of national economy slowed relatively but still operated in the reasonable range.
According to the data of National Bureau of Statistics, the fixed asset investment growth, total imports and other data in July have come down.
Sheng Laiyun said, as for the national economy in July, I would like to use the words of Premier, "the shape is volatile and the potential is still good". This is a better way to summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July.
He explained that "the shape of the fluctuations" refers to the fall after rise of some economic indicators growth rate in July.
In July, the domestic and international economy is still in the deep adjustment, the international situation is complex and volatile and the world economic recovery is less than expected, so the export pressure is still relatively heavy.
As for the domestic situation, the whole economy is still in the critical stage of adjustment, adjustment labor pains are releasing and the economy is under great pressure, so some indicators are still fluctuating.
Sheng Laiyun pointed out that there was a special case in July, with serious floods, high temperature and hot weather which have brought some impact on production and operation of some areas.
According to the recent report of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people were affected, with direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yuan.
From the view of industrial, investment and transport-related indicators, these areas are affected to varying degrees.
The cargo turnover growth rate in July fell back 3.6 percentage and floods on these areas have a certain impact on traffic.
From these factors, it is quite normal to have some fluctuations in some indicators. And such thing is expected.
He said, "The potential is still good" means that despite the fallback of economic growth, the overall economic performance is stable and steady. And the good momentum has not changed.
In July, CPI rose by 1.8%, with a month-on-month rise of 0.2%. From January to July, CPI rose by 2.1%, so the overall price situation is stable.
According to the statistics of hot weather in the districts and counties by the portal of the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Meteorology, in addition to Youyang, the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance.
At present, at least 28 provinces in the country have clearly defined the standard of the allowance, but the standards issued by provinces and municipalities are not the same, and people in Chongqing receive the allowance based on the count of high-temperature working days.
In case of temperature between 35 and 37 ℃, people can receive allowance of no less than 10 yuan per day. In case of temperature above 37℃, people are released with the allowance of not less than 15 yuan.
In case of temperature above 40℃, staff working in high temperature can receive up to 20 yuan per day of allowance (but for laborers who enjoy the high temperature job allowance).
In accordance with this standard, people in Kaizhou which has the highest number of high temperature can receive 330 yuan. And people in Chengkou with the least days of high temperature can receive 80 yuan. And the maximum temperature of Youyang did not meet the high temperature standards, so there is no high temperature allowance.
In the past, many companies adopt cool drinks as high temperature allowance. The city safety supervision bureau deemed that this behavior does not meet the current regulation.
Employer shall not deduct or reduce the wages of workers in case of terminating work and reducing working hours in high temperature weather.
The city's Human Resources and Social Security Bureau said that if employees did not receive high temperature allowance while working under high temperature, they may fight for the legitimate rights and interests via the labor dispute mediation organization or dial 12333 for complaint.
If the employing unit refuses to pay the high temperature allowance, the laborer may lodge a complaint with the competent department of human resources social security at the county level or above.
At the same time, because the high temperature allowance is part of the wage and not welfare, such allowance shall be included in the total wages, with tax deducted.
So the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage, it must be issued in cash and not substituted by physical objects such as drinks.
The newly built Urumqi station is located in Urumqi high-speed rail area, with the whole construction area of around 100,000 square meters.
The layer 1 and 2 are for entrance, waiting room and office, commercial use while the layer -1 is for exit.
At present, Urumqi station is Xinjiang's largest integrated transport hub, integrated with high-speed rail, rail transportation, public transportation and rental as one. People can achieve a variety of seamless dockings.

There are a total of 30 channels on the east and west side of the waiting hall. Passengers can check the ticket on the ticket number for quick inspection and waiting.
If you need help, you can choose the 41 call buttons and get timely services.
From July 1 onwards, the old passenger station, that is, the passenger train of Urumqi South Station is shifted to Urumqi station.
In other words, all the CRH trains and the 30 pairs of other trains departing from Xinjiang can be parked at Urumqi Station.
Now, passengers can buy tickets at these two stations. The train passing time between these two stations is about 10 minutes. Passengers need to pay attention to the detailed name of the initial and terminal station on the ticket.
Urumqi new passenger station, after its official launching into operation, will become an important platform to build the national integrated transport city and promote the construction of "Silk Road Economic Zone" and the new district.
Gracia is a cute female toucan, exuding the breath of tropical rain forest.
In Costa Rica, one of the Central American countries, Toucan Gracia and its story have long been known.
At the press conference on August 10, after postoperative rehabilitation, Gresham finally appeared and showed people its brand new 3D printing plastic beak.
This toucan, which had its beak broken and was dying just one year and a half ago, finally regained its new life.
This day not only announced that it has restored health by 100%, but also signaled its moving into the luxury aviary to meet its human friends.
The newcomer Grecia was slightly shy initially, but soon became lively, rolling in the basin frolic and eating grapes with a new beak.
In order to remind people that it has suffered damage, the technical staff did not give it a new beak color, but to retain the original white color of the 3D print material.
The beak is a thin layer of horny sheath, which is hollow inside and only has some of the thin bone to support.
Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is fragile and may be broken when it is hurt.
Animal rescue center, ornithologist and a US 3D printing company worked together to prepare several "test beak" for Gracia and finally built a "perfect beak" for it.
Now Gracia has been able to use the new beak to drink water, eat, and even peck fine grains.
"The design of the finished product costs about two months and it just takes 4-5 hours to print it."
"3D printing is not the future technology but really enters into your life." Thomas Lange, the chairman of US SG3D printing company said in an interview with Xinhua International.
In January 2015, Gracia, lying on a farm in the town of Alajuela in the middle of Costa Rica, was found with blood covering on its body.
At that time, its beak was cruelly broken by a group of young people. It was completely unable to eat and dying.
After the tragedy of the Gracia was reported by the media, there are a tide of animal anti-abuse call occurring inside and outside Costa Rica.
People demand to establish more rigorous animal protection law to enhance the punishment against abusers.
People came spontaneously to try their utmost to help Gracia restore its life before hurting.
Even the inventor of the 3D printing technology, Chuck Hull, is also involved in the design of the Gracia beak.
"The situation of Gracia is very special, and its remaining part of the beak is less than 1 centimeter, so there are many difficulties in installing the new beak."
"We first scanned Gracia and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis slightly longer than the rest of its beak and fixed on its beak with glue."
"This can reduce the risk of further intrusive damage to Gracia," Lange told Xinhua International.
Before installing the prosthesis, the staff cleared the broken beak of Gracia every day to prevent infection.
Thousands of miles away, the story of the Toucan Gracia touched the famous documentary director Paula El Reidia and the news channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded a little bit of the process of installing a new beak, and recorded a documentary "The Country of Toucan", which was played this month on the Animal Planet Channel.
The documentary "The State of the Toucan" shows people how a small Toucan has changed a country and how people get involved in the fight against torture of animals.
Core Tip: Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of Chinese oil companies, especially known as the "teapot" of China's small independent refinery.
August 12 report on Cankaoxiaoxi website: Japan's largest oil company JX Energy believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the market downturn."
Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of Chinese oil companies, especially known as the "teapot" of China's small independent refinery.
China's oil products are gradually close to Japan's oil products because the Chinese government has strengthened environmental protection regulations.
Before obtaining the import license for crude oil, "teapot refinery" generally refines oil from the heavy oil, which has high sulfur content and is imported from Russia.
The petroleum products are poor in quality due to high sulfur content and become one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining crude oil import license, "teapot refinery" can import Oman crude oil and Russian crude oil, which have low sulfur content and improved petroleum products.
East Fuel General Oil Company said, "With China's domestic oil product quality standards continuing to improve, the refining capacity of the equipment also increased.
As a result, the quality of oil products exported from China gradually rivalled that of Japan (the world's highest quality).
According to JX Energy, "After the end of 2015, China began to export high-quality light oil to Australia." Such light oil products are competitive with Japanese products on the Asian market.
Although the "Japanese high quality oil" falls into a crisis, the Japanese oil companies just adopted the strategy of "exporting to profitable areas while being concerned about the market".
As China's exports of petroleum products have a huge impact on the Asian market, teapot refinery got more attentions.

UV not only tans your skin but also sunburns it, so how to make the skin go through the military training, without sunburn?
Sunblock is generally marked with SPF and PA on the package. SPF refers to Sun Protection Function and is targeted at UVB. The common SPF index includes 15, 30, 50, etc.
The product marked with PA is for UVA, so that sunblock will play a more effective role. Usually, the intensity of PA is represented with +. An extra + indicates extension of effective protection time.
Water-based sunblock with a strong penetration is often applied to oily skin. Sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
Creamy sunscreen is often applied to dry skin. The classification of neutral skin generally has no strict rules. Any kind of skin care products are burden to the sensitive skin. So it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products.
Remember to apply sunblock half an hour in advance, because sunscreen products take time to completely penetrate into the skin.
Because you are exposed to sun longer during the military training, you have to apply the sunscreen products once every two hours to lengthen the effect. So keep doing it.
As the skin has just been stimulated by the sun's sake, do not immediately use whitening products after returning from military training.
After exposure under the blazing sun for quite a long time, please wrap the ice with towel to ease the sunburned skin and alleviate the local heat if condition allowed.

During some nights, the ionized layer is full of free electrons, which means that the radio signal can go further.
According to the report of Popular Science, an American monthly website, on August 11, the US Air Force was interested in copying this effect.
Although the stable ionizing layer with a large number of free electrons may help people listen to the radio at the edge of a university radio station, but this may not be the interest of the US Air Force.
Ionization layer full of electrons indicated the radio used by the military has a larger range of broadcasts. In addition, it may prevent the global positioning system (GPS) signal from the solar storm.
The final goal may be to build a series of cube satellite according to the requirement. They may enhance ionization layer when necessary.
But firstly, the team that signed contract with the air force must prove that the scientific principles will work.

Although the first four notices are not directly involved with coal industry, the target industry is directly related with coal industry.
From last November to this January, the price of Qinhuangdao 5500 kcal steam coal lingers at 370 yuan/ton and 90% of the coal enterprises fell into a loss.
And since February, coal prices gradually picked up, Qinhuangdao steam coal prices rose continuously for four weeks, rose to 16 months high, once climbed to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan per ton over the beginning.
With the price rising, come along the concerns of various industries: will a number of small coal mines resume production?
In this regard, Kuang Xianming, head of the Economic Research Institute of the China (Hainan) Reform and Development Institute, conducted an analysis and interpretation.
Kuang Xianming: overcapacity cut roused the high concerns to various industries. The report card of the overcapacity cut of the coal industry announced today make everyone feel worried indeed.
These three superficial factors reflect the reason behind the relative lagging behind of our growth pattern change. That is, the government-led growth has not yet been fundamentally changed.
Second, it is also directly related with the force of local government. During the overcapacity cut process, the funds and the corresponding supporting measures should be in place. From this point of view, the differences are indeed relatively large among different regions.
Thirdly, some of the provinces that are relatively slow in progress may face greater risks if they seek acceleration in progress in the second half of the year.
In this case, relying on the central allowance to raise funds to promote the process of production capacity may have a negative impact.
First, the overcapacity cut is not a simple cap control.
Our goal is to eliminate the backward production capacity, promote the optimization of the structure and restructure the new format of the entire coal industry.
During the process of overcapacity cut deploying, the local government must combine the production capacity and the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry to develop the relevant service industry.
Second, in order to complete this year's overcapacity cut task within this year, we must give full play to the power of administrative supervision.
Finally, we should strengthen the role of social security.
Because the market is directly related to the employment problem, we have to strengthen the employment skills training of employees.
"The reason for the ranking decline is that Brazilian GDP growth is expected to worsen in the medium term."
In 2015, Brazil's participation in global direct investment was 3.7%, down from 5.7% in 2014.
The International Investment Attractiveness Index of Credit Suisse Bank includes four sub-indices: infrastructure, economic outlook, business environment and direct investment.
In 2015, Brazil's international direct investment was $64.6 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year, Brazil's "green investment" (in the investment model of building factories abroad) was $17.9 billion, a year-on-year fall of 2.1%.
"There are 288 'green land investment' projects in Brazil, with an average annual rise of 314 from 2003 to 2014".
However, in the first half of 2016, the international direct investment in Brazil had reached $33.8 billion, an increase of almost 10 per cent compared to the same period last year.
Title: Canadian police killed IS supporters: homemade bomb attacks downtown preparations near the end
The taxi company said the taxi was dispatched to the Dreyfus before the police arrived.

According to the German voice, in the video, a man wearing a black Barakella hat is reading the "Koran", referred to the crime against Muslims, and vowed to attack a Canadian city sooner.

Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal branch channels Old Wanfu River and Beidaliu will charge tolls since September 1.
The two tributaries will conduct construction via social financing. The charges have been approved by the relevant provincial government departments.
The old Wanfu River channel flows through Jinxiang, Yu Tai and then through the Nanyang Lake into the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal main channel, with a total length of 32.5 km.
According to the navigation needs, the old Wanfu River channel takes the mode of conservation and transformation. Dredging was conducted on the local depth and curve cut-off on the local sharp bend. Then the navigation conditions can be improved.
The channel flows through Jinxiang County, Rencheng area and then through the Nanyang Lake into the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal main channel, with a total length of 19 km.
The renovation project of the two waterway started construction in February 2011. The delivery inspection was conducted in January 2015. The investment construction and operation main body is Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center.
In accordance with the "loan construction and charging for repaying loan" principle, Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center will collect channel tolls according to the charge standard approved by Shandong Provincial Price Bureau.
Among them, the basic toll is 1.75 yuan/dwt and mileage toll is 0.05 yuan/km dwt.
The toll collection date is from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019.
Reporters learned from Jining Port and Waterway Bureau that there are a total of 4 toll channels within Jining territory, including Zhushuihe Channel, Baima River Channel, Beidahang Channel and Laowanfu Channel.
These four channels are Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal tributary channels, which are upgraded and renovated in the way of social financing.
Zhushuihe Channel Upgrade Renovation Project is the first project adopting the mode of "government + market" for the infrastructure construction of river and ports within Shandong province. The government accounts for the major part of investment while social fund supplements the funding gap.
Baima River, the laowanfu River and Beidaliu River and other feeder routes adopt pure market operation.
The funds allocated by the state finance cannot meet the needs of the project construction and restrict the progress of the channel upgrade.
Social funds for the construction of public infrastructure are in line with national policy requirements and have become a way to break the bottleneck of funding.
Ning Zetao's performance in the 100 meters freestyle semi-final has made a lot of Chinese audience speechless.
Actually, this 50-meter freestyle is not the subject of Ning Zetao. His performance and best achievement in Kazan World Championships also indicate it is not possible for him to make breakthrough in this project.
Sure enough, Ta Kung Pao, an authoritative media in Hong Kong, revealed that the biggest reason for Ning Zetao to lose is that he has lost interest in swimming.
Many factors may have a great impact on his future ideas. He is now more interested in entering the entertainment circle.
After Kazan World Championships, Ning Zetao instantly become celebrity with his good look and excellent performance.
As a result, "national husband (a good match)", "fresh little meat", "gorgeous", etc. have become his label.
A variety of business activities came to him. He really have a golden flashing prospect.
In this case, that Ning Zetao chooses to withdraw and joins the entertainment circle, is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable way.
After all, he is only 23 years old. After a certain degree of study, he can perform some TV series with his popularity.
But Ning Zetao needs to see whether he is qualified enough compared with his predecessors.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, the already 21-year-old Liu Xuan came to the end of athlete career.
The beautiful appearance of Liu Xuan makes her quickly remembered and also lays a foundation for her to join the entertainment circle.
After retirement, Liu Xuan starred in a number of TV series, and in 2013 she set up her own studio.
Tian Liang participated in the single and double ten-meter match of two Olympic Games, and won 2 gold and 2 silver.
But when he was defeated by his counterpart Hu Jia at the single 10-meter match in the 2004 Olympic Games, Tian Liang's competitive state slipped and it was said he was dismissed by the diving team.
But when he took along his daughter to participate in the variety show "Dad, Where Are We Going?", he became a focus.
The once gold generation Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing all participated in a variety of variety show.
It is worth mentioning that, Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng led the Chinese team and won champion in the 2008 Olympic Games men's team. Yang Wei even got his individual all-around gold medal twice and was called as the Almighty King.
And Chen Yibing has become a ring king while leading his team to win the champion in the 2012 Olympic Games men's team.
But after he was misjudged and lost the gold in the London Olympic Games, his magnanimous act won him so many funs.
However, these game players mainly focus on the venue, they just touch and then go at the variety show.
However, no matter whether they are retired or active athletes, they need to provide outstanding performance to win in the entertainment circle.
After all, athletes have just stepped into a new area, so it is just a space state for them in case of capabilities and connection.
Even for Tian Liang and Liu Xuan, who are not new in the entertainment circle, common people always think of their performance at the Olympic Games when mentioning them.
And the introduction of Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng at the variety show is always Olympic Games Champion.
Compared with these people, Ning Zetao is slightly weaker for the title of Swimming World Championships.
Compared with these people, the title of Ning Zetao, a swimming world championship, is not so great.
Moreover, compared with the withdrawal of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan and Yang Wei, etc. at their peaks, the withdrawal of Ning Zetao at 23 after some setback would cause immeasurable effects to the negative influence of his image.
After all, at the mention of athletes, people's requirements on athletes are "not seeking victory but for no fear of danger". Ning Zetao lags far behind from this point.
At the very least, Ning Zetao can totally rely on his great looks to win the support of thousands of huge fans.
It is a lot more difficult to be famous in the entertainment circle by just relying on good appearance than training.
You have to listen to your inner voice on your life path. But as for how to choose, Ning Zetao should be quite conscious.
On the surface, the online social platform expands our social circle and reduces people's loneliness.
The sphere of influence of social networking not only replaces the traditional telephone contact, but also gets down to the offline living circle, quietly changing the current social life of the people.

"Social network features low cost, fast transmission speed and simultaneous communication among several people. This meets the requirement of modern college students."
Expanding the interpersonal relationship circle, more equal dialogue, avoiding social concerns are major reasons for us to be fascinated with online chat.
New comers in the company love online exchange with colleagues. "We are not familiar with each other when we just come to the company. The likes and comments on social platform makes people much closer to one another. "
People who love to make friends also love online communication. "I lost contact with my friends due to some misunderstandings. We became familiar again after a few dialogues on the group chatting."
IT engineer Wu Yan is a profound social networking lovers. His majority social life occurred online and his online contact is several times than that of offline friends.
Wu Yan himself admitted that the network is more "in his element".
"You can respond to your friends when you are willing, because there is a lot of time to think over the words and you can express it more clearly.
"The communication hidden below one's ID can avoid interpersonal clash. This not only has room for maneuver, and even gives each other more time and space to thought and deeds."
"People of different identities have the same rights and efficiency to speech. Various social concerns during real life may be eliminated immediately on internet."
However, Xiaopeng, a friend of Wu Yan, thought that Wu Yan is a "very boring otaku."
Xiaopeng and Wuyan meet each other in the group chatting. They two get familiar with each other because they are active speakers.
Xiaopeng thought that Wuyan is quite different from the one on internet. He is quite bored and does not take the initiative to express his views. His words are repeated like this, "Oh, yes, right", or "I will check it online".

The court trial of Nanyang Wolong District People's Court of Henan province found that the defendant Li Huiwang sent fraud information through the pseudo-base station equipment in Tongbai county and Nanyang district between September 30, 2009 and October 4, 2009.

Sun Fujian is a Party cadre, but he lost his ideal and belief by violently breaking the discipline of the Party after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. In addition, he is not astringent and breaks the rules. Such deed is vile and grave indeed.
After the occurrence of this case and a number of media reports, this has become the focus of the case, with extremely bad social impact.
After the case, Haikou City Public Security Bureau of Interpol detachment leaders attach great importance and immediately organize a detachment of elite troops to take the initiative to investigate.
The police immediately pursued and attacked the suspect on the internet and took a variety of measures to control. In addition, the police contacted their colleagues of other cities to investigate the whereabouts of Wang.
As the suspect is a stealing recidivism and repeatedly dealt with by the public security organs, he has strong anti-reconnaissance capabilities. In addition, due to his long-term drug abuse, the often drug addiction makes trial work quite difficult.
Greenland sharks are also known as small head sleeping sharks, widely distributed in Greenland and the North Atlantic waters around Iceland. It has the length of 4 to 5 meters in their adult age.
But their growth rate is extremely slow, sometimes only about 1 cm a year, suggesting that Greenland shark may have an extra-long life.
Traditional dating methods usually use calcified tissue of animals. Some fins can use fins, but this calcified tissue is very scarce in Greenland sharks.
A new study led by Julius Nelson of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, turned to the use of Greenland shark's ocular lens for radioactive carbon dating.
This method had previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it is the first time to be used to determine the age of sharks and other fish.
Their analysis showed that the life span of the largest shark is estimated at 392 years old, with the error of 120 years old.
That is to say, this shark is aged at least 272 years old. The maximum age may be 512 years old.
In addition, the female Greenland shark is alleged to be sexually matured at about 4 meters in length. That is, it can only reach adulthood at least until the age of 156.
The researchers thus wrote in the paper that the Greenland shark was known as the vertebrate with the longest life span on the Earth, surpassing the age of the previous longevity champion black right whale (211 years).
Over the past year, the exchange reform results are significant, with RMB exchange rate remaining basically stable, but also laying foundation for promoting the internationalization of the RMB.
From the point of market performance, over the past year, the two-way floating characteristics of RMB exchange rate is outstanding. The elasticity of exchange is expected to be strengthened and the exchange rate is expected to be generally stable.
Ever since the exchange reform, the fluctuation of RMB against the US dollar often appears, with ups and downs during the process.

According to the theft gang members, they came to Shanghai in the way of chartering unlicensed taxi. Then they came down the taxi and gathered and took taxi several hours later. Finally, they left Shanghai together.
During the crime offence period, the criminal suspects swept the floor for theft from top to below by climbing the external wall and breaking the window fence.
Recently, the suspect involved was transferred by Xuhui Public Security Bureau to Xuhui District Procuratorate for prosecution.
Police reminded the general public to lock the doors and windows before going out. In addition, citizens are recommended to choose the relatively hard steel material for anti-theft window.
In late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will go to Kenya to attend the 6th African Development Conference, according to the Evening News Peak of Voice of China.
The African Development Conference was dominated by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo, Japan or Yokohama, so this meeting will be the first move to Africa.
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said the meeting held in Africa will help to attract attentions of African and European countries to Japan.
In line with the trip of Shinzo Abe, according to Kyodo news agency, the Japanese Liberal Democrats will send parliamentary groups to the countries concerned.
Japan's "application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council" began in the early 90s of the last century while the African-sponsored African Development Conference also began in 1993. This is not a coincidence.
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations and is therefore an important ticket bunker of the United Nation. How can Japan give up Africa if it wanted to join the United Nations Security Council?
It will also exchange views with national stakeholders on the extreme organization of "Islamic State" and terrorist activities.
"Western Group" will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea Bissau.
Fumio Kishida, the current Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan has also recently stated the intentions of the African Development Conference at the UN Security Council.
Abe has announced here that in order to stabilize the stability of sub-Saharan African countries, it will provide 100 billion yen (about RMB 6.1 billion) in five years.
Observers generally believe that there are two purposes behind Japan's generosity toward Africa: first, to increase Japan's presence in Africa; second, to win the support of African countries on the application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
"In terms of politics, Africa is relatively lagging behind, but there are many African countries. So Japan has always regarded it as the so-called 'big ticket field,'" said Yang Bojiang, an expert for Japanese issues.
Japan will not give up in the future and its work on Africa will not be terminated but gradually strengthened.
Economically, Japan enjoys a strong production capacity, but its domestic market is relatively limited. In particular, the domestic demand is relatively weak in the context of aging population.
However, from Junichiro Koizumi, who was Japan's prime minister 10 years ago, to the present Abe, Japan has repeatedly launched the "sprint" scheme. However, all schemes were abandoned eventually.
Yang Bojiang believed that the intension of Japan to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council is be clear at a glance. However, the road is bound to be full of obstacles.
To achieve its own goals, Japan should firstly do a good job with the surrounding countries. And Japan needs to have a correct attitude no matter in geopolitical competition or in the national dispute or understanding of a historical problem.

Traditional customs introduced a new bright spot "2016 Bon Culture Festival" -The Opening Ceremony of Victoria Park, Hong Kong
Gongs and drums of music, the traditional snacks, fancy decoration and stormy crowd scene.
Organized by the Federation of Hong Kong Chiu Chow Community Organizations, "2016 Bon Culture Festival" was held in Victoria Park between the 12th day and the 14th day of the month. It's the largest grand club in Hong Kong.
In addition to the continuation of the existing "Climbing Competition", "parent basin for the heap" for the entire family is also added.
Bon culture history is introduced in the form of comic books. In addition, Bon theme 3D self-timer area, traditional snack area and traditional craft flow classroom are set up at the scene, attracting many friends and overseas travelers for visit.
A French couple lingered at the scene for almost 3 hours and experienced a lot in the mini flower card flow classroom.
"After knowing this special festival online, I decided to come and I felt quite fresh."
They said, although there are similar festivities commemorating the ancestors, the atmosphere is quite solemn. But here you can enjoy music, food and also can learn traditional craft.
She said, "It is quite pleasant to see sizable and organized ancestor worship ceremony in such a busy financial metropolis of Hong Kong".
"This not only embodies the diversity of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to understand these traditional craft and heritage."
"We do not want to make the Bon Culture Festival very horrifying, which may spook people, especially the children," said Hu Yansong, the chief responsible person of the event.
"We hope that through the youthful activities and layout of the scene, so that young people know that the culture behind the Bon Festival is to express the filial piety and thanksgiving."
He also said that this time a total of 24 teams participated in "climbing competition", which is not only organized by communities, but also in combination with schools and attended by students.
It is understood that the Federation of Hong Kong Chiu Chow Community Organizations is listed as "national intangible cultural heritage list" in 2011.
On the evening of the 11th day of the month, China National Peking Opera Theater took its famous TV play "White Snake" and traveled thousands of miles to Mexico City. They presented the local people with an authentic Peking Opera feast in the Mexican National Palace.
As the key performance project of "Sino-Latin American Cultural Exchange Year", from August 9 to 23, China National Peking Opera Theater performed seven opera in the Mexican capital Mexico City and Córdoba, Juarez and other five cities.
The audience sometimes smiled and sometimes applauded for the changing and concluding of the "White Snake" episode and the actor's singing.
I watched the performance of Marissa Jimenez Kachie accompanying her daughter in the Peking opera performance 15 years ago.
"This is a fantastic performance. Its music, lighting and stage performances are impressive to me ... ... I think it is necessary to let her daughter understand the Chinese culture and Chinese opera art."
The enthusiasm of Mexican audience left a deep impression on the young actress of lady white.
"It never occurred to me that the Mexican audience were so enthusiastic. I had some worries about whether they could understand the story, but it was beyond my expectation to see them catch the story and the laughter today.
Qiu Xiaoqi, the Chinese ambassador to Mexico, said that the various cultural exchange activities of this year's "Sino-Latin American Cultural Exchange Year" promoted the two peoples to deepen mutual understanding and enhance their friendship.
Next year is the 45th anniversary for the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mexico. By then there will be more cultural exchange activities held in China and Mexico.
Liu Cigui came to Sanya for the research of "Double Restoration and Dual City" and required to enhance the level of urban construction and management
In the morning of 12th day of the month, Liu Cigui presided over a symposium, listened to the report of the progress of the pilot project of "Double Restoration and Dual City" and the suggestions and comments of the relevant departments.
Liu Cigui provided fully affirmation for the stage results and good experiences and practice.
Liu Cigui stressed that Sanya should firmly grasp the historical development opportunities and take the pilot work of "Double Restoration and Dual City" as key content to give full play to the leading role of demonstration during the economic and social development in order to firmly grasp historical development opportunities.
We should lead to improve the internationalization of international tourism and enrich international elements and build international boutique from the details.
We should lead in the urban and rural integration and tourism, accelerate the construction of characteristic town and integrate tourism into each project and build each village and town of Sanya into tourist attractions.
We should lead in "the 100-day social service investment move" and promote a batch of key projects and park construction to ensure the settlement of high-quality project and implement the various requirements of the big move.
Zhang Qi, the Provincial Standing Committee and Sanya Municipal Party Committee Secretary, Wang Lu, vice governor and Lu Zhiyuan, secretary general of provincial government participated in the research seminars.
In the 14 years of her sports career, Deng Yaping won a total of 18 world championships, becoming the first Chinese to win four Olympic gold medals in China's Olympic history.
She ranked first in the table tennis for 8 years to maintain the world's first and is a female athlete to rank as the "the world's first" for the longest time in the history of table tennis.
On September 26, 2010, she served as Deputy Secretary-General of People's Daily, general manager of People's Search Network Co., Ltd. and the department-level cadre.
Recently, she will work together with Yu Minhong to build the first domestic sports industry innovation and entrepreneurship platform.
There was also a team of star coaches in the Chinese sports circle. They were gorgeous in the era of athletes and won countless glory for the country. After retirement, they passed what they learned to the new comers and cultivated a great number of champions.
As the first world champion in Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yubin chose to pick up the pointer after retirement.
From the women's team coach to the men's team coach, to the head coach, Huang Yubin created an "Olympic gold group", and led to win 9 gold, 1 silver and 4 copper at the Beijing Olympic Games.
Since then, Tian Liang has been experiencing advertising endorsement. He has even served as a "Cowherd", "Lei Feng" and other important roles in recent years.
Many NBA players have proved their strength. But whenever there is progress, there is decline.
Whether it is because of the increase in age or limited playing time, some players will have regressive performance each season.
Of course, some "retreat" may only be data shrink, but the strength of these players may not have been reduced.
Even if Wade is still one of the league's best linebacker, his performance in the Bulls is not so good as that of the Heat.
The backcourt range of he and Londo is limited. The three-point hit rate of headed star Butler is just 32.8%, making their next-season offence quite challenging.
After coming to Feng Cheng, the Red Star will definitely give the ball right to Butler and Rondo and he himself choose to play healthy in the regular season.
Okafor's situation is more embarrassing. As the first choice of 76 people last season, he had to compete for playing time and ball right with Simmons and Enby in the new season.
This competition may not come soon. Simmons also need to adapt to the NBA stadium, and Enbi must also be fully recovered from the injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafor can have a position in the long array of 76 people.
Last season, 32% of the score of Okafor comes from the low attack. Such rate is higher than Cousins, Wuchevich and Brook Lopez, while his use rate is also the top 40 in the league.
With Simmons already showing a good point-forward potention, Enbi also has a better stature more suitable for NBA games and Okafor's position is hard to be so solid.
Over the past two seasons, Thompson's use rate has stabilized in the top 20 of the league and this is the best two seasons for his career.
But the problem is, with the arrival of Durant, Thompson's appearance ratio will surely decline, which is bound to affect his play.
This effect will not only be the impact of the number of shots, Thompson's holding attack in the next season will certainly be greatly reduced, which in some ways will reduce the opponent's defense difficulty.
Durant's arrival will certainly negatively affect the score of Warriors players, but the one with the most negative effect is probably that of Thompson.
But this does not mean that the level of Thompson steps backward. This is more likely that he made sacrifice for the team as a whole.
Parker had a better performance than last season. This is not only because his basket efficiency came to the highest level, his chemical reaction with Aldrich also benefits the Spurs.
Duncan retired, Ginobili announced a second battles for a year and the combination of GDP eventually came to an end. As one of the youngest among three people, the oil tank of French sports car is not much left.
After getting the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular MVP than that of James, while Jordan was the only one who had more FMVP than that of James.
Oh, yes, James has just brought the first professional sports championship trophy in Cleveland in the past 52 years.
Coming to the 14th season of his career, James needs to better conserve his strength and get ready for the playoffs.
Therefore, in the regular season, James's capability is likely to further decline, he will give more weight to Owen to bear, but he will still easily become the league's top three players.
"I must carry forward what I learned in China to apply to Russia".
On the 12th day of the month of the local time, Huang Jing, chairman of the Moscow Overseas Chinese Association said excitedly while she saw the reporter of Chinanews.com.
Not long ago, she participated in the "overseas Chinese culture community Chinese talent (calligraphy, painting) training" hosted by Chinese State Council Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and sponsored by Jinan University.
While participating in the training course just now, she did not know where to start in painting and calligraphy. As a result, after the end of the course, she has been able to draw and write her own works.
After returning back to Moscow, I will use the knowledge and skills learned in China to Russia and make my own contribution for the cultural transmission and promotion of the Chinese culture.
At the same time, Na Yanwei, the Secretary-General of Russian-Chinese Culture Promotion Association who also participated in this training course had the same feeling.
She said that she made great progress with the help of teachers of the training classes and she felt the heavy responsibility of being the "overseas communicator of Chinese culture"
She said, after she came back to Russia, she would surely carry out the traditional Chinese culture among the Chinese and the Russians who love Chinese culture.

Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.
But, regardless, Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team.
It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
It has been some journey for GB.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost just one.
This hammering will hurt but the progress is startling.
Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun.
It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.
With four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing, which was converted.
12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.
A superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji.
On seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17-0 to the bad.
Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.
The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.
It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade.
Which is pretty much how it is.
GB made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the Fijian dam...for all of four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay.
Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.
Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn't need icing with another try in the dying moments.
The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference.
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle
There will not be a more emotive gold at these games, and that is saying something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Though they were the two pulling on the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height.
Their dominance was absolute, after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans, does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, it was touch and go.
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.
If they don't it goes everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It alters your outlook a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season, keeping the disruption to a minimum, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough.
That's how it starts off.
Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.
In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for Williams, who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."
It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well.
It's been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.
Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much in the moment.
Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything amazing.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did.
The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.
For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," she said.

Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any missteps quickly enter the public record.
Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, distorted teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface."
And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action.
Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."
She added that "it's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects.
It shows that the filter isn't just yellowface, but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they're able to make decisions like this," Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, "or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up."
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.
For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."
Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says
Officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday.
The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this much is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continued.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).
But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.
The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown With Britain
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.
"I have no clue," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.
The first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin.
However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster.
Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.
The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change.
"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.
She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.
She is on a roll.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.
The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.
His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.
"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.
"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.
Strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.
In researching the book, which includes recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.
As never before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.
"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.
He was fabulously out of touch.
President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."
Many of the Depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.
The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.
"She had a real fear of food waste," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."
There was the cream-puff incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called prune whip," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Mr. Coe went back for seconds, and thirds.
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that the crude oil production in July continued to increase and Saudi Arabia's output hit a new high.
The report cannot prevent the market from doubting the credibility of OPEC. Oil recovery path is still bristled with thorns.
On Monday, OPEC Chairman and Qatar Energy Minister Sada said OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
The monthly report of OPEC on Wednesday showed that the output of the entire OPEC organization in July, including Gabon, increased by 46,000 barrels/day to 33.11 million barrels/day.
OPEC also said in a monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil, thus increasing the degree of excess supply to the market.
Affected by this news, coupled with the production output expectations of rising crude oil and the unexpected increase in crude oil inventories, aggravating the excessive market supply.
As of Wednesday's close, the light crude oil futures of New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 2.48% in September and the future price of crude oil in October in London Brent fell by 2.07%.
Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of the oil-producing countries is unlikely to tighten the supply. The data released by US Energy Information Administration also suppress the market sentiment.
Iran's official news agency Fars on Wednesday, quoting the speech of Zanganeh, Iranian oil minister, said that Iran's daily crude oil production was up to 3.85 million barrels, which has been the highest level since 2008.
At the release of the news of the meeting, the Russian energy minister Novak said that it was unnecessary to conduct a new round of frozen production negotiations under the current oil price.
It was April when the oil-producing countries had meeting. No agreement was reached among the OPEC member countries.
Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMIResearch, said the market and the media could react excessively to OPEC's meeting.
Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC changed the market sentiment by releasing signals that they would make an agreement.
This means like a smoke and a mirror that draws people's attention (deliberately giving a false impression).
Eugen Weinberg, director of commodity research at the German commercial bank, said the possibility of OPEC trying to stabilize the market through the September meeting was low.
This is likely to further undermine the market confidence in OPEC. After all, this organization already staged a "wolf is coming".
All localities should take medical institutions which have illegal medical advertising, complaints focusing on the past and have repeatedly been punished as a focus of inspection.
National Health Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine will timely carry out supervision on the supervision and inspection work of some provinces.
According to media disclosure, the large influx of capital into the Internet medicine has resulted in the serious problem of current product homogeneity. Investment boom fade gradually and capital came into the wait-and-see period.
According to the data of Hong Kong Ai Li Pi Hospital Management Research Center, a large number of start-up Internet medical companies languished just within one year and about 20% of the start-up Internet medical companies has ceased to exist.
However, just as the majority of Internet medical companies struggle in the road of A round or B round of financing, several sub-areas leading enterprises can still get the capital touted.
It seems that the Internet medical business shall not "swarm", but to see the needs of the market, and be professional and profound.
Yuyue invested 12 million yuan, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, while Jiuzhoutong invested 18 million yuan, accounting for 60% of the registered capital.
In recent years, with the country providing policy support in the medical information, electronic and integrated supply chain management system gradually enter the hospitals at all levels.
The cooperation between Yuyue and Jiuzhoutong is aimed at the needs of the market, helping the hospital to build advanced supply chain management system, and take this opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet medical companies which go in for grandiose projects, iBaby focuses on the Internet obstetrics vertical field and be professional on pregnant mothers and doctors.
Pregnant women can not only enjoy 24 hours of medical services free of charge and one-on-one inquiry with doctors, but also pay for medical counseling.
At the doctor's side, iBaby breaks the geographical restrictions by taking the form of organizing experts to give grassroots doctors an online lecture, peer exchange, case discussion and so on.
At present, three plates are set up for doctor's client side, respectively, for doctors to continue education, social exchange and communication.
The following services are provided, including online learning, case discussion and academic exchange; social platform for the exchange of doctors of the same hospital and department; legal assistance, business support and other services required by doctor-patient relationship or personal life.
According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali health "is willing to get down" to win big health data.
Internet companies and data companies are short of professionalism. No unity can be provided on the same entry.
The layout of Ali in the medical and health field is divided into three plates, namely, Ali Health, Lynx Pharmacy and Alipay future hospital.
Wang Lei admitted that it was more difficult for medical and health companies to start up than other industries, "This is not just how much money you have. In addition, it requires people to be concentrated on it and endure the loneliness.
Staying up late watching the Olympic Games will damage the heart easily
Brazil Olympic Games is in full swing. Even if the event is broadcast in the midnight in China, many people will stay up late to watch.
In this regard, the doctor reminded that staying up late has health risks and may lead to cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up for a long time, the hormone will have a lot of secretion and your body will continue to be in a state of intense excitement and cannot have normal recovery. This may easily cause vasoconstriction, blood pressure and thus cardiovascular disease.
Han Zhiyuan reminded people who have high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipids, smoking habits, family history and other cardiovascular risk factors may easily suffer from cardiovascular disease if staying up late.
If you stay up late, then your cardiovascular function will be affected, your gastrointestinal function, immune system, neuroendocrine system will also be affected, and even the risk of cancer will increase.
For old friends, Han Zhiyuan suggested them better not stay up late to watch games, particularly those with cardiovascular disease.
During the last "World Cup" football match, Han Zhiyuan received a 60-year-old patient. His onset of myocardial infarction may be related with staying up late to watch games.
According to Han Zhiyuan, his department had treated some 25-year-old myocardial infarction or stroke patients. This is largely due to long-term stay up of patients.
1. Do not stay up late every day. You can occasionally stay up all night watching the favorite sports and watch the rebroadcast for other sports next day.
2. You may drink more water, have more fruit during stay up as this can prevent blood clogging and enhance your body immunity.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union transported the missile into Cuba, which almost led to the US-Soviet nuclear war.
This event was seen as the pinnacle of the cold war, known as the "Cuban missile crisis."
But what is little known is that during the Cold War, a strong solar storm has almost led to a nuclear war of the United States against the Soviet Union. The incident has not been announced by the researchers until August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused strong interference to the radar and radio communications of the US military in the Arctic.
These radars were part of the ballistic missile early warning system of the US, used for monitoring Soviet missiles.
This paper was written by researchers at the University of Colorado, who interviewed US military personnel involved in the forecasting and analysis of solar activity and reviewed non-confidential documents.
The paper wrote that in the 1960s, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly launching nuclear war, the US Air Force has always had some fighters with nuclear warheads flying in the sky.
US military commanders did not know that the culprit of the interference was the solar storm rather than the Soviet Union, so they ordered the fighters to enter combat readiness state.
Fortunately, the US military force had started the study of solar activities and its electromagnetic interference to the Earth since the 1950s, it ultimately stopped this potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the US Air Force Air Meteorological Service and submitted a detailed report.
The direct consequence of this solar storm is that the US military has seen space weather as a combat concern and has built a stronger space weather forecast system.
During daily travel, when citizens found that their cars were hampered by a strange vehicle, they may use "WeChat vehicle moving" function to solve this problem when they failed to contact with the strange vehicle driver.
From August 11, Xi'an traffic police WeChat service number "Xi'an traffic police" launched "WeChat vehicle moving" service.
After the launching of this service, during daily life, when the citizens found their cars were hampered by unfamiliar vehicles, the driver of which is not at the scene, they may solve the problems via "WeChat" function.
The new service has many functions, the first of which is fast efficiency, saving administrative costs; the second is respecting and protecting the privacy of citizens; and the third is all-weather and full-time service.
Citizens can operate it quite conveniently with their WeChat. Such method enables the both sides to meet in a friendly and easy way and alleviates and solves the problem of difficulty of parking and reduces the occurrence rate of car-related public security cases.
On the other hand, for those who refuse to move and have illegal parking or obstruction, Xi'an traffic control department said the traffic police will take different measures to handle the actual situation based on the actual situation.

On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly issued a new version of "US-Japan defense cooperation guidelines" in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role in the world.
This is the day the US Defense Secretary Carter, US Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and Japan's Minister of Defense Gen Nakatani attended the press conference in New York.
This is the fifth time that China's civilian think tank has published the Japanese military assessment report and the fourth launch of the English version.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including the overall policy adjustment, military strength, defense budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, military system reform, military training, foreign military security cooperation and military security relations with China and so on.
The report said that the year 2015 is a phased last year of the Abe government to promote major policy adjustments in the security area.
Since then, Japan's initiatives in the field of security will be mainly in the legal system, strategy implementation, policy implementation and other operational level, rather than the substantial adjustments and changes of framework, mechanisms and policies.
The report emphasized that the Abe Cabinet tried to break through the above three points to achieve the promotion of Japan's "normal nationalization", and the going-out of militia to intervene in international security affairs, strengthen Japan-US alliance and prevent the rise of China and resist China.
Previously, the China Strategy and Culture Promotion Council released the Japanese military assessment report on June 5, 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014 and June 30, 2015.
British "Financial Times" on August 12 released a group of pictures on mansion of US ambassador to China.

The residence is gray, and strongly fortified by peripheral fence, the second interior wall, barbed wire entanglement and vehicle roadblocks.
Improvement of public sports facilities
Dark coal field warehouse is turned into a "green grass" football field while red brick spire plant is turned into a modern sports museum.
On the national fitness day, Nanluo Maying Sports Culture Park, outside the Hangzhou Wangjiang gate, unveiled its mysterious veil.
It was a coal field once and remained idle for more than 10 years after its closure. A large number of illegal construction and garbage were left behind.
After the renovation, it became a sports and cultural park, and will be officially opened in November to the public free of charge to provide sports venues. In addition, it would undoubtedly open up a new fertile soil for the whole people.
This reminds people of Hangzhou Chen Jinglun School. This is a "Whampoa Military Academy" in China's swimming world, in which several world champions were born.
Swimming champions will be produced continuously, producing a vivid interpretation of the relationship between competitive sports and national sports. The profound mass base provided a good condition for selecting professional players.
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of national sports. Athletic sports depend in a certain sense on national sports, and national sports depend on the conditions of the site.
According to reports, as of 2015, the area of China's per capita sports venues has been 150 times of that when the new China was established, but still far behind the sports power.
In June this year, the State Council issued a "National Fitness Program (2016 - 2020)" and took the development of mass sports as a key content.
In order to fill the short board, on the one hand, the relevant departments shall take full account of the layout of the stadium at urban planning.
On the other hand, the already built public sports venues, including schools and other units in the sports venues, should try to expand the scope of openness and try to improve efficiency as much as possible.
The Rio Olympic Games, which is in full swing, has stimulated people's enthusiasm for sports, but also aroused everyone's awareness of participation.
Gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, a U.S. district judge has ruled.
In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
In a filing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city.
They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations," he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns.
"Your move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "request" - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers.
Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.
The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.
How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center.
Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception.
The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."
The hotel's clerk said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels."
The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
It is in itself a great shame.
The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace.
That needs no explanation.
We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.
Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.
"Shame on you," another post stated, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue.
The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying.
It adds that the code was now added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.
Under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money.
Some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.
The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.
They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.
He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.
There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.
Hindes said: "It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."
We all as a team came together in the last three months.
We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
That is one event, one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London.
If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits.
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games.
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
That would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny next competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.
The team event is always the best.
You get to win it with your mates.
It's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest.
Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.
He had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.
Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.
After truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London, expectations have been played down in the lead-up to Rio.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the evidence of the first night's racing in the velodrome, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again.
After the little baby came to this world, Mom and Dad shall be responsible for his life, not only for his health, but also for the development of his spirit, that is, education.
If such education failed, then no matter how successful your career is, you cannot make up for the shortcomings of life and family failure.
When a new baby is born, the new dad and mom need to spend time in taking care of and educating him, and be responsible for him.
And responsibility is not only reflected in the care of body, making them healthy, but also the education of spirit. That is, to make children learn how to behave, grow up and succeed.
Good family education means that parents often need to accompany their children, to take care of them patiently and teach them develop a civilized behavior and make them learn knowledge better and enhance intelligence.
Parents' words and deeds will affect the growth of their children because they will imitate their parents. And that is the so called, "like father, like son". Your son will be the same as you.
So we need to be a good example in front of children, regulate our words, cultivate our characters, which will indirectly help children shape their own excellent character, so that he will become more excellent.
Amy is a smart and pretty girl.
She is outgoing and can get along well with friends. In addition, she can adapts to the environment quite well.
But Amy has a little secret in her heart: she cannot concentrate long on what she wants to do and works on.
This secret is accompanied by Amy for a long time. Usually the problem is not serious.
Even though she learns and works in decentralized, modular, she can complete the task basically, and achieve good results.
However, when the task is heavy and pressing, Amy feels very painful and tortured.
The individual's resistance to self-exposure and his emotional experience is to prevent the individual's self-awareness and self-esteem from threatening.
And some behaviorist psychologists understand the impedance as an individual's disobedience to their behavioral corrections.
I tried to let Amy do an exercise, let her breathe through the way to calm down and feel the torment.
And once he left the trapped situation, she felt relaxed and regained freedom.
The current 63-year-old wanderer Han and another tramp Xiao had a dispute after alcohol drinking. Then Han stabbed Xiao to death with a fruit knife.
Han said that before the incident, he and the tramp Xiao lived in one lane of Dongcheng District. The two were just 20 meters apart.
Han said that on the current day of the crime, the two were asked to drink alcohol. And the two had two disputes during and after meal.
Han said that he was afraid that Xiao may hit him, so he picked up a fruit knife from the garbage pile and stabbed him to death.
At the court, the victim's family asked Han to compensate for a total of 530,000 yuan in the form of funeral expenses and compensation for death.
4 years after Uber joined the Taiwan market, it caused no small impact on the local traditional taxi industry.
According to the information of Taiwan "United Daily News" on August 12, more than 100 taxies bypassed Taiwan Executive Yuan for protest. This resulted in serious traffic paralysis in the surrounding area.
It has been four years since the arrival of Uber in Taiwan, but the authority just launched the meeting at the end of this month. Drivers cannot wait any more, said Zheng Lijia, the chairman of Taipei Driver Union.
However, the government eat their words and delayed again and again.
The law-abiding taxi drivers, who are at the bottom of the society, had to compete with the unrestrained Uber and felt deceived by the authorities.
Original title: The Owner of A Jiangsu Farm Was Punished Because He Disposed of The 2,000 Chicken Without Permission Which Were Checked And Detained By The Court
After the verdict comes into effect, because Lee did not automatically fulfill the obligation to determine the verdict, Wang apply for enforcement to the Shuyang court.
On October 16, 2014, Shuyang court made a civil ruling, and ruled that all of the 2,000 farm laying hens shall only be seized and shall not be transferred and sold without permission.
After Lee received the detention ruling, without the permission of the Shuyang court, he privately sold partial egg laying hens.
Until March 8, 2015 when Shuyang County Public Security Bureau conducted a survey, there were only 142 layers on the farm.
On August 12, reporters was informed that the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and the Winter Paralympic Organizing Committee issued a notice that the Beijing Winter Olympic Organizing Committee inherited the emblem and signs of Beijing Olympic Winter Games for commercial purposes.
Without the permission of the Beijing Winter Olympic Organizing Committee, no one shall use the emblem and signs of Beijing Olympic Winter Games for commercial purposes.
The head of the Department of Industrial Coordination of the National Development and Reform Commission said that iron and steel overcapacity is now a global problem.
China's capacity utilization in recent years is higher than the global average, but also higher than that of the United States and Europe and other countries and regions.
China has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess capacity, and the results are gradually emerging.
The official pointed out that the CPC Central Committee and State Council should attach great importance to the global problem of iron and steel overcapacity.
All departments and regions should actively implement the deployment of the State Council, earnestly carry out the work, and reduce crude steel production capacity by 45 million tons this year.
From China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports. On the contrary, it also takes a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The person in charge stressed that the international trade of iron and steel products is essentially a market behavior and an independent choice from the requirement of importing countries and after considering the product cost and other factors.
The implementation of trade protection measures does not help to fundamentally solve the global steel industry development issues. On the contrary, it will only cause further impact on the international trade order.
When it comes to debt, the person in charge stressed that the resolution of the debt problem is to properly handle the important issues that need proper handling.
As the iron and steel enterprises are large-scale and involve a wide range of enterprises, the debt relationship is complex. It may lead to regional risks if disposed of improperly.
According to the person in charge, in recent years, with the economic downward pressure to increase, the total social demand gradually weakened, part of the industry capacity utilization decreased and enterprise production and management difficulties increased.
Some enterprises do not meet the changes in the market environment and the production and management is difficult to sustain or even on the brink of collapse. But restrained by some institutional factors, they become "zombie enterprises" due to many obstacles to the market.
The existence of these companies distorted market signal, reduced the elements resources use efficiency, increased the cost of social management, thereby hindering the establishment of market environment with fair competition.
The main reason for the loss is the same as the dilemma faced by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low utilization rate.
China mainly adopts the market mechanism, economic means and the rule of law. The government is mainly to do the work of disclosing the ins and outs to workers and social stability, to ensure fair and equitable market order.
The person in charge stressed that the next step is to do a good job to ensure overcapacity cutting and ensuring the objective of resolving 100 million tons-150 million tons of crude steel production capacity within five years.
In the afternoon of the 10th day of the month, the appearance of Chinese tourist police in the Red Square in Moscow immediately drew people's attention. Chinese tourists waved with surprise, and the local people and foreign tourists cannot help but to stop looking back.
On the same day, China's first professional travel police team - members of Tourism Police Detachment, Sanya City, Hainan Province Public Security Bureau came to the Red Square in Moscow, and communicated with the local police on duty.
Moscow travel police are divided into three groups for duty patrol in the Red Square, Nicolieski pedestrian street and Gu Mu Department Store. The Chinese tourist police also followed for study. The whole process lasted more than an hour.
Female police officer Liu Xinie is 20-plus years old, proficient in English and Spanish. She just joined the tourism police team last year.
He carefully observed every word and action of the Russian counterparts and communicated with her from time to time.
When he saw Spanish tourists come for consultation, the Moscow travel police explained to him with fluent Spanish, which impressed Wang Bing.
"Every Moscow travel policeman master foreign language, and some even can speak more than two languages, which impressed us a lot."
"Hainan, as an international tourist island, is gradually paying attention to attract international tourists. We hope to improve their ability to match the status of international tourism island."
On the current day before the study, the Chinese tourist police also went to the brigade station of Moscow city police to communicate with their Russian counterparts.
"I often deal with Chinese tourists and I am very happen to see them travel to Russia."
"Their usual questions are: where is xxx, for example, where is a monument, how to rent a taxi and how to return to the hotel."
Lei Sakov, the brigade captain of Moscow city police said that in recent years, Moscow's urban environment and tourism ambience have become better and better, attracting more and more foreign tourists.
In order to meet the needs of tourism development, it set up a tourist police team in July 2014, responsible for patrol in the major scenic spots, thus helping and diverting the tourists.
At present, all Moscow tourist policemen are proficient in English and some also master Spanish and German.
The police brigade divided them into nine groups according to their foreign language levels. They have two classes per week, learn self-defense moves, laws and regulations and foreign languages.
"At present, there are two tourist police beginning to learn Chinese and they can speak fluently. We have to continue to improve their Chinese level," Lysakov said.
Lysakov told reporters that the Moscow Tourism Police since its inception, have accumulated a certain amount of experience and hoped to inspire counterparts in Sanya.
He believes that the cooperation between the Russian and Chinese police departments will enhance the security sense of their citizens to each other's national tourism.
"The recruiting, police mode and equipment of Moscow tour police officers and their excellent interactions with visitors have brought us a lot of inspiration." Chen Xiaokun said.
Chinanews journalist found that there are at least nine provinces and cities issuing rules for the implementation of residence permit, including Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian and Beijing, etc.
For the conditions of applying for residence permit, the above regions generally said that the applicants need to live more than six months and meet one of these three requirements: having legitimate and stable employment, having legal and stable residence and continuous study.
Chinanews journalist noted that in the aspect of residence permit providing treatment, the "gold content" is different in various cities. Compared with the national provisions, some areas have provided more public services and conveniences.
These areas have increased the conveniences of children to attend college entrance examination in the local place while meeting the related requirement.
In addition, it is clearly proposed by Beijing and other places that they will gradually expand the scope of public services and convenience, and regularly release to the community.
For example, Fujian proposed to announce the public services and convenience of residence permit holders to the public at least every 3 years
"Residence Permit Provisional Regulations" provides that, for those in line with the residence permit conditions, the public security organs shall issue a residence permit within 15 days from the date of acceptance.
For the time limit, most of the region hold the same opinion with the national version. That is, to release the permit within 15 days.
Hebei clearly stipulates that for applicants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents, the residence police station shall issue a residence permit within 3 working days from the date of acceptance.
Jiangxi clearly stipulates that for applicants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents, the public security shall issue a residence permit within 5 working days from the date of acceptance.
In accordance with the "residence permit provisional regulations", the above cities stipulate clearly that the cost of certificate production shall be exempted in case of initial application of residence permit.
For example, Sichuan required the local police stations or commissioned community service agencies shall strictly enforce the approved fees and charges standard and resolutely prohibit over-range, over-standard fees or ride fees.
It was found that on July 27, 2016, Chen Yangxia, the former Ganzhou City Dingnan County Party Secretary came to the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection for reporting and serving as director of the CPC supervision room (deputy director-general, one year's probation period).
The red wine at the dinner was provided by Li Youcai while other costs were borne by Liu.
Jiangxi Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection informed that Chen Yangxia and Cheng Ziliang, who organized and accepted dining invitation in private clubs, violated the spirit of the central eight provisions and the Party's discipline.
Last season, Pogba was punished with two yellow cards. He will be banned automatically according to the rules.
Although he has transferred back to the Premiership, the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup) still passes his accumulative suspension to FA Cup.
In this way, on August 14, in the away games of fighting against Bournemouth, Pogba will watch a fight without helping any party. His first show after return to Manchester United will be extended to Southampton's home game on August 20.
As the No.12 new arrival of the first round in 2014, Salic will officially land on the NBA in the next season, and join the Philadelphia 76ers.
As a young European player, Salic is not known to many fans. But I believe he impressed people with his performance in this Olympic Games.
In a game with win by a narrow margin of Croatian over Spain, Salici successfully blocked Paul - Gasol in his last moment and tried to drag the game into the overtime basket attack.
Recently, Brett-Brown, the commander-in-chief of the 76-team gave Salic a high rating. He thought he saw the shadow of young Manu-Ginobili in Saric.
It is quite obvious that Saric already showed his gift and made 76 people full of expectations.
In Croatia's first two games of the Olympic Games, Salic received a total of 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Salic showed his capability of drawing space on the scene. He can have a shot outside the three-point line via the pick and roll with his colleagues.
Although the current 76-team is packed with many gifted young players, they are not equipped with the outside scoring capability as Salic.
From block shot to launching a long pass, fast break and complete assists, there are just a few insiders who can do it on the NBA game.
Since the beginning of this Olympic Games, Salic has obtained 13 points, eight backboards and five assists in three games, with a full performance.
James has signed two 1 + 1 contracts since he decided to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014.
Now, as this labor agreement is about to enter the last year, James will be in the forefront of labor negotiations as the vice chairman of NBA player union.
The substantial increase in union revenue is attributed to the new television protocol. The question is how the boss and players deal with the money. The outside world is worried that the NBA will fall in the next summer.
But for James, he will not have to worry that he will become a free agent next summer because he has renewed a 3-year contract with the Cavaliers.
No matter when the 2017-18 season kicks off, James is within the contract.
Since the stunning debut of iPhoneSE, the mobile phone market also ushered in a small screen machine boom.
Not long ago, Nubia also launched the first works of its Z11 series: nubiaZ11mini.
NubiaZ11mini follows its consistent photographed gene, and is equipped with a one-hand easier-to-hold 5.0-inch screen, portable and convenient post-fingerprint recognition, contributing to its superior experience.
A small screen camera phone Z11mini, which was just listed by Nubia, had a price fall of RMB 200, decreasing from the original RMB 1499 to RMB 1299.
In appearance, nubiaZ11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen. The classic "little red circle" design is below on the front side.
The middle frame is metal material. Its bottom adopts symmetrical design and is equipped with Type-C data interface.
Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed.
The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.
A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.
And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.
The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant.
AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," it said.
AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.
Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event."
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."
The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
And as a generator that wouldn't be good for us," he said.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year, with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.
Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts.
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.
Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.
It's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."
The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing.
"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.
Bordini's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.
For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.
Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
A woman lay down in the dark on the road "in a desperate act" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.
She died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified, said police, who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
Was it possible to avoid impact?
That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.
Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.
The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement.
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.
We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and right across the country, we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average of around $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood, having been born roughly 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they ever will.
At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
According to Zheng Jianjun, the Management Section Chief of Nanhu Park Water Area, the deepest point of the South Lake is more than 10 meters deep. People who do not understand the situation of water are probably confronted with danger.
"Although the Nanhu Park rescue team is very professional, we still hope that the majority of rowing tourists can wear life jackets and stay away from illegal activities on the lake to play safely" Zheng Jianjun said.
Wai Tau Tsuen boasts a unique marine environment, with two leisure travel resources including natural ecology and cultural ecology.
"However, several owners who bought the parking spaces in the community feared that this would affect the price of their parking spaces and doubted that others were selfish, so they had been plotting for bad things. This had shelved the parking space transformation. "
As for the question about when the sweet potatoes are introduced and by whom, there are still many different versions in the academic community.
In the current mainstream view, there are three major lines for the introduction of sweet potato.
Among the three lines of introducing sweet potato, the introduction by Chen Zhenlong from Philippine to Fuzhou is the one with the greatest impact and largest communication.
Beijing Municipal Social Management Office will soon carry out special inspections on the use of unified receipts of social group membership fees.
Inspection is divided into two categories, unit self-examination and spot inspection.
Relevant person in charge of the municipal association said, the scope of the inspection covers social groups who received unified receipts of social group fees in the social mass organization between 2013 and 2015.
"The success of the Olympic Games is defined by people who share stories in social media," said the Rio Olympic Organizing Committee while establishing the communication strategy of 2012 Olympic Games.
From the news reports of the Olympic Games, all media have made a lot of changes in the aspect of mode of transmission, product form, language style, news perspective and many other aspects.
It seems that the International Olympic Committee and the media practitioners around the world will have to meet this round of challenges.
On August 11, this is the last day for the open sale of Everbright Securities H shares. News went that the market response was not special for market of the previous two days. According to the plan, it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18.
A domestic brokerage analyst said that the Orient Securities in Hong Kong did not enjoy a good foundation. Only its capital management business is its strength. It has many inherent problems compared with Bank of China International and CITIC Securities, etc.
Experts pointed out that with the return of the securities market to flatness, many brokers sagged this year in results. But the detailed situation of the listed companies is dependent on the detailed development of the corporate business and cannot be generalized.
After the introduction of the regulation of the new deal, Suzhou will become the first second-tier city to restart the purchase restriction.
In addition to Suzhou, other second-tier cities including Hefei and Nanjing will also introduce the property market regulation and control policies.
Prior to this, Hefei has been the first to issue restrictions on lending policy. For people who have two suites in Hefei and have one housing loan not paid, they will be denied with the mortgage services from bank.

Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.
A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.
"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.
They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.
"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.
"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.
After experiencing the “golden era” of a soaring box office in 2015, the film market retreated into a cooling-off period in 2016. Whether box office takings could surpass last year’s total of RMB44.069 billion is questionable.

BBC claims that Beijing has become the most exciting city: making foreigners feel like “living in a new age”
Reference News Network reported on January 18 that the British media organization has noticed that Beijing is rapidly transforming into a glamorous modern city in spite of the fact that it is 3000 years old.
The Chinese capital is interconnected by amazingly high-speed Internet and has implemented cutting-edge technologies such as face recognition. It has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has an unmatched capacity of internationalization. It is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners who are eager to explore the world.
According to a report on the BBC website on January 16, the German expatriate Clemens Sage said: 'If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere.' He quoted a song written by singer Frank Sinatra to praise New York City.
Sage, who served as Creative Director of Traveler Archives, said: "If Sinatra lives today, he is likely to sing a song for Beijing." He said that living in this city will make you feel like “living in a new age”, which means that you can always keep up with the trends.
Simon Norton, who originates from England had been living in Beijing in recent years, published an article on personal blog site 4Corners7Seas saying: “People generally have a feeling of being at the center of something grand. Although this feeling is hard to describe clearly, it is the reason why so many foreigners stay there for a long time. They want to see what it will become and hope to witness it. ”
According to reports, the city's high-quality, high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever before.
Andy Peñafuerte, who originates from Manila and is currently the deputy editor-in-chief of the website Beijing Children, said: "Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society. The Internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smart phones, making it easier for everyone to conduct various transactions."
According to reports, smart phones are just the beginning of Beijing's technical ambitions. Face recognition technology is being widely used across the city. Many mobile phone applications use this technology to facilitate bank transfers and payments, grant people access apartments and offices, and even use it to verify identity of the drivers providing car-hailing service.
Beijing recently announced plans to invest 13.8 billion yuan in the construction of an artificial intelligence technology park. When it is completed, more than 400 companies will settle there. They will focus on the development of artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food plays a central role in China’s many major traditional festivals. Foreigners are enthusiastic about these festivals. The Spring Festival is the most important festival in both social and economic sense, and it is also one of the most enjoyable festivals for foreigners.
Sage said: “It's a pleasure for me to help Chinese friends prepare for the New Year. It is equally important to clean the apartment and paste the red spring couplets with blessing words on the door. On New Year’s eve, all family members must gather together to have a good meal and stay until midnight, and finally to celebrate the New Year with fireworks. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and their family is indeed an opportunity for blending. ”
According to reports, a large number of foreigners are living in Beijing and the number is growing. However, the language barrier and the convenience of exchanges between the expatriates can easily become excuses for not fully integrating into the local culture.
Sage said: 'Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but they have little experience with their host country. If your initial attempt to interact with the Chinese is not successful, then it is easy for you to feel more comfortable with other foreigners.
In these so-called 'foreign bubbles' ('Laowai bubble' refers to circles in which foreigners only mixed in with foreigners, without touching local people and local culture -- translator's note), foreigners mingle with each other in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only make friends with foreigners.
The easiest way to overcome problem is to learn a little bit of Mandarin – something easier than one might think.
Sage said: “One or two hours of private lessons in Chinese every week or learning entry-level radio dramas should suit everyone’s busy schedule.”
Even learning a few classic phrases will help with shopping, ordering a meal in a restaurant, or chatting on a taxi.
According to reports, persistent air pollution is also a fact of daily life, but the government has tried to curb pollution in recent years.
Residents emphasize that outdoor activities are very important in warm months when pollution is often light. It is important to consider those blue sky days as opportunities for rambling in ancient encryptors or exploring the popular Ritan Park.
Norton said: "Beijing is a Chinese city that one can find most things below the surface. You can find very good arts and music activities, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and ancient hutong areas."
The report believed that the hindrance to growth in human capital as a result of aging has become increasingly apparent. This was particularly the case in the Northeast, where the annual average contribution of aging to human capital growth was -1.28%.
Pan Gongsheng said that the present of risk of cross-border capital flows can be controlled. The fundamental factors underpinning international balance of payments will still exist over the longer term.

In April this year, the European Commission accused Google of coercing mobile phone manufacturers into installing software such as the Google search engine and Chrome web browser, or they would not be allowed to use other Google applications.
The European Commission believed that this harmed consumer interests and hindered competition.
EU regulators initially requested that Google make a response prior to July 27.
If found guilty of violating antitrust rules, Google could face a maximum fine of 10% of its global turnover, or approximately US$7.4 billion.
Google has not made immediate comment on this.
Google also faced EU investigations over giving prominent placement to its own shopping services in search results.
Zhang Yuning's stay-abroad is a real one. It can be said that his achievement of “jumping level” from the national youth to the national Olympics is by no means accidental, and his leap-forward growth is still surprising.
Understand through a picture: Bitcoin's legal status around the world
Abstract: A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation, the current round of digital currency tumble has also to do with the 'sworn enemy'—regulation.
From the visualized maps, the attitude of the eastern countries towards Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West. Most countries in the world are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies, indicating that the “risk of the black swan” is still looming large.
*This article is taken from Wallstreetcn (WeChat ID: wallstreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more exciting information, visit wallstreetcn.com or download the Wallstreetcn APP. *
As the authorities in major markets of Bitcoin -- such as China, South Korea and the European Union -- take decisive regulatory measures, the digital currency market dominated by Bitcoin has experienced major bloodshed this week. The price of Bitcoin has fallen below 10,000 dollar, recording the biggest one-day drop.
A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation, the current round of digital currency tumble has also to do with the 'sworn enemy'—regulation.
At this important juncture, HowMuch.net, a visualization big data website, produced a map showing the legitimacy of Bitcoin and regulation measure in place in countries around the world.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legal market for Bitcoin, and orange represents the neutral market. Although there is no place where Bitcoin is acknowledged a legal currency, there are no major restrictions on the use it. The pale pink represents the restricted market, i.e. the local government tries to the use of the digital currency pass by drawing a red line or taking regulatory measures. The deep pink represents countries where Bitcoin is declared as illegal. The gray represents countries that have not yet been rated.
(The above figure was drawn by the HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15th)
The article points out that from the distribution of non-green color patches in the graph, it can be seen that the oriental countries in the traditional sense are more conservative towards Bitcoin than the West.
Russia is currently the largest country that defines Bitcoin as illegal. China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin. India is one of the largest countries that have not commented on Bitcoin and have not made relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are the regions that have highest level of tolerance to Bitcoin i.e. where green patches are concentrated.
The views of the countries in the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are clearly divided, so, the distribution of color patches in these areas is more mixed.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil are all legitimate Bitcoin markets. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bolivia have some restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin. Most Latin American countries have not made any comments about Bitcoin.
From the above data, it can be seen that of the 246 countries that have been rated, a total of 99 countries (or 40% of the total) haven't imposed any restrictions on the transactions and use of Bitcoin. They are represented by green and orange patches.
Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4%) have defined Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53) %) haven't given comments on digital currency (grey).
This shows that countries that account for the global majority (53%, more than half) are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies represented by Bitcoin. This means that the “black swan risk” is still very large for Bitcoin, because some of these countries may ultimately make legislation that restrict the use of digital currencies.
The article believes that global regulators have not fully understood the digital currency as a new type of currency. This may be the main reason why most countries have not chosen a stance.
Although Bitcoin’s popularity has grown exponentially since last year, it does not necessarily mean that all countries are interested in it. It's probably that some countries are concerned that the local currency may be undermined by digital currencies or that digital currencies are used by criminal organizations.
Wallstreetcn has published an article summarizing the news related to regulation measures against Bitcoin across the world since last week, including: China starts to crackdown on online platforms and mobile APPs of over-the-counter exchanges; South Korea is still considering to close the digital currency exchanges; the European Union holds the view that Bitcoin has not yet been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of “losing everything”.
Wallstreetcn Editor's selection: Reading News | 2018: Global Central Banks Are Ushering Digital Currency? One article points out that 2018 is destined to be the first year of digital currency for central banks across the world, viewing from the perspectives of supervision, acceptance/criticism and adoption.
The act of questioning the legal status of Bitcoin by big countries such as Russia is actually meant to make way for the official issuance of digital currencies.
On January 8th, the Barcelona new aid Philippe Coutinho showed up for the first time in Camp Nou with his Barcelona shirt, the Xinhua News Agency reported in Madrid by reporter Xie Yuzhi.
Coutinho passed a physical examination of Barcelona early that morning and signed with Barcelona president Bartomeu a contract that will expire in the summer of 2023.
Then he appeared in the face of nearly 7,000 Camp Nou fans as a Barcelona player.
According to a Spanish media, Coutinho's transfer fee may amount to 160 million euros (1 euro≈ 1.77 Chinese yuan), being the highest paid player in the history of Barcelona and La Liga.
As Coutinho is still injured at the moment, he still need recuperate for nearly 20 days before ushering in his debut in the Barcelona shirt.
Is nothing sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.
In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.
But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.
As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.
The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.
Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.
The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.
She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.
Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.
Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.
Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.

World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team
UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.
"We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out," Black said.
"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.
And the guy on the corner street, too.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.
"Eilidh is slightly modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.
Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.
As for my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.
So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."

Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
He chafed at the criticism, sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.
"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.
But it matters.
And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.
He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.
The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.
"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.
And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Any movement in the property market would have an impact on the sensibilities of the general public.
Purchase quota is a fixed threshold many cities would adopt when implementing real estate control measures.
In May 2017, Jinan issued regulations stating that undergraduates who make social security contributions consecutively for half a year will be entitled to be treated under the same residential property purchase policies as that of local residents with permanent residency.
In June, Wuhan issued policies that stipulate that university students may settle in the city within three years of graduation based on their graduation certificate and employment permit.
After the policy was enhanced, officials stated that “university students are entitled to purchase residential property at a 20% discount to market price”.
In July, Chengdu issue regulations stating that young talent with overseas university bachelor’s degree or higher academic qualifications may apply to settle in Chengdu based on their graduation certificate.
In addition, Kunshan, Lingang in Shanghai, as well as other cities or regions also issued relevant “talent introduction” policies, and lowered the threshold for buying residential property and settling locally for talents.
Zhang Hongwei believed that this was, in fact, large cities competing for population, particularly talent. Only by retaining population, particularly talent, can a city be competitive. This then, was the key significance of these real estate policies.
Some even believed that this implied that the time has come to abolish residential property “purchase quotas”.

Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.
Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.
He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf in.
The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."
Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to do well; but you do feel that extra pressure.
I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf.
I'm happy with how it's going so far."
Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Zou Shoumin, Director of the Bureau of Environmental Supervision of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, said on the 22nd in Beijing that on a nationwide basis, 57 cases were subject to consecutive daily fines. The newly amended “Environmental Protection Law”, implemented at the beginning of this year, has significantly enhanced environmental law enforcement efforts in China.
Presently, the environmental protection bureaus across China may use various means of punishment to investigate and deal with conduct in violation of environmental regulations such as impose consecutive daily fines, close down operations and/or distrain, limit or suspend production, and persons held under administrative detention. They will also work together with judicial organs to punish environmental crimes.
Zou Shoumin said that in August, a total of 335 cases were concerned with closing close down operations and/or distrain; 177 cases pertained to limiting or suspension of production; 189 cases were concerned with persons held under administrative detention; and 166 cases pertained to persons held under suspicion of environmental pollution crimes.
In particular, Henan imposed consecutive daily fines on seven cases. At present, China is moving from control at the end toward being involved throughout the entire process, intensifying efforts to treat environmental pollution on an all-round basis.
Although pressures from slower economic growth have emerged, China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection had already made its position clear; China should correctly and appropriately position environmental protection in economic growth, and increase “green determination”. The more economic growth decelerates, the more it should hold fast to environmental protection, and ensure that environmental protection plays a positive role in optimizing the economy.
There’s no peak, only higher. The share price of Kweichow Moutai has continued to set new highs unabated.
On January 9, A-share “champion” Kweichow Moutai set another new record high, closing at RMB782.52 for the day. Total market capitalization amounted to RMB983 billion, just a stone’s throw from the RMB1 trillion market capitalization mark.
The guidance price of RMB1,499 was RMB200 higher than the previous retail price of RMB1,299.
On December 28, Kweichow Moutai announced that upon study, it has decided to appropriately hike the price of Moutai liquor products in 2018; on average, the magnitude of the hike would be approximately 18%.
This price hike caused Kweichow Moutai shares to soar. A Beijing Morning Post reporter calculated and found that Kweichow Moutai’s share price had increased by RMB95, or more than 14%, over the eight trading days since the company announced its price hike.
Data showed that the aggregate output value of Guizhou Province for the first to the third quarters of 2017 amounted to RMB950 billion. Maotai’s market capitalization far outstripped Guizhou Province’s GDP for the first three quarters.
Driven by Moutai, listed baijiu companies began to introduce price hikes and control supply, enjoying the dividend brought about by consumption upgrading.
2017 year-to-date, the share prices of most listed baijiu companies have continued to soar. In particular, the share prices of Swellfun, Wuliangye Yibin, Shanxi Xinghuacun Fen Wine, and Kweichow Maotai have at least doubled

Reference News January 18 report Russian media claimed that Russia’s Minister of Trade and Industry, Denis Manturov, said that the unit price of the automobiles in President Putin’s “motorcade” is priced at RUB6-7 million or higher.
The budget target is to contain the price at 15% lower than a Mercedes-Benz S class.
Russia Lianta network reported on January 16 that from the end of February to the end of March, the key R&D unit for the President’s automobiles - Central Scientific Research Automobile and Automotive Engines Institute (NAMI) - will deliver 15 automobiles to the Federal Protective Service.
The report states that the “motorcade” project requires manufacturing three types of vehicles - limousine, three-carriage vehicle and a small passenger vehicle - for the nation’s leader using a the same module platform. The budget allocation for this project is RUB12.4 billion.
The report claimed that news of manufacturing the first locally produced limousine in Russia for the President emerged some five years ago. According to the plans of the R&D unit, the new automobile will be equipped with a 800hp engine and armor, and will weigh six tonnes.
It is understood that the engineering and technology team of Germany’s BWM is participating in the R&D of the engine unit.
Elsewhere, according to reports by TASS on January 16, Manturov told reporters that the “motorcade” series of automobiles will be sold externally from 2019. All configured models will be available.
This minister said, “From next year onward, all interested parties may place an order. There are no sale restrictions on any model, whether it is the bullet-proof or the luxury model.”
Russia’s Ministry of Trade and Industry plans to increase the annual production of the “motorcade” series of automobiles to more than 1 million after 2020.
Manturov said, “Manufacturing 18 units puts us at full capacity now. This year’s output is more than 70 units, with 200 units next year, and 300 or even more the year after.”

This is the first company in the world to develop and manufacture educational robots. After graduating from university, 23-year-old Xiao Xu
chose to come to Shanghai and he built his own team within half a year.
My dream is to make a robot that belongs to myself and helps others.
The robot needs some motors, steering gears, and controllers, all of which can now be developed ourselves.
Shanghai introduced preferential policies
It also led a group of innovative talents to stay in the country and stay in Shanghai.
The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China first proposed the construction of a modern economic system and demanded that
are being transformed from traditional manufacturing industries.
In the first three quarters of this year, the value of smart manufacturing reached nearly 16 billion yuan, an increase of nearly 40% over the same period last year. Our original business was
producing the elevator control system. In the past few years, we clearly felt that the new kinetic energy of the whole new industry was not enough. Therefore, we
stepped up the transformation and development of this enterprise.
In accordance with General Secretary Xi Jinping’s request, Shanghai is speeding up its march toward becoming a science and technology innovation center with global influence.
In order to speed up the process of transforming of scientific research from paper to money, Shanghai promulgated local regulations this year to promote the transformation and service of scientific and technological achievements.
Ten days after the closing ceremony of the 19th NPC, Shanghai released to the public the implementation opinions on further promoting the development of a new generation of artificial intelligence.
In the process of innovation, there are many unsuitable conditions.
can thrive with vitality.
Enter a new era, science and technology innovation are promising.
Located in Shanghai, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Micro-Satellite Innovation is the vanguard of China's satellite technology innovation research.
to make a certain thing. In itself, the target choice for this task is new.
With the average age of researchers being only 31 years old, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Micro-Satellite Innovation
will also launch five satellites in the near future.
From materials and devices to components of all-round innovation, it promotes the upgrade and transformation of China's manufacturing industry chain.
In the report of the 19th NPC, it is clearly stated that China has entered into a new era. Personally, the standard of a powerful nation is to take the lead.
So far, all satellites launched by our Little Satellite Institute have been groundbreaking, and we will not follow others or chase after others.

Entering into a new era, the strong driving force brought by innovation-driven development to Shanghai is emerging.
Braving to try, daring to make breakthrough, self-determination and the enterprising spirit also originate from the fact that Shanghai has always taken institutional reform as the key to developing this great article.
The report of the 19th National Congress of the CPC pointed out that to deepen the reform of the science and technology system and establish an innovation system that takes the enterprise as the main body, the market as the orientation and the industry-university-research institute must have deep integration,
which is precisely for the reform mechanism to promote innovation and create a better atmosphere for the innovation subject.

Zhang Dejiang, president of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, attended the 4th National Constitution Day Symposium and delivered a speech on the 4th.
He emphasized that we need to regard the study and implementation of the socialist ideology with Chinese characteristics in a new era of Xi Jinping

and unify it to the major decisions and deployments set by the 19th National Congress of the party.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.
An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.
There is no public transport.
The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.
"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.
According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people struggle to compete.
"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.
The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.
As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.
"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."
The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.
The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.
Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.
One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.
"I have been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never reappear.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds the discontent.
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.
What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically backed the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.
"What else could we do?"
Brands such as Suofeiya, Holike and Topstrong have leveraged the strength of capital to actively grow their business in the customized home furnishing industry. On February 10, 2017, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) approved the IPO application of Guangzhou Shangpin Home Collection Co., Ltd., and issued a listing permit on the Small and Medium Enterprise Board of Shenzhen Stock Exchange. More than 20 days ago, Oppein Home Group received approval for its IPO.
Industry insiders believed that with the listings of Shangpin Home Collection and Oppein Home Group, the customized home furnishing sector, which was already soaring, will turn from production competition to competing for capital.
At the beginning of the new year, when Shangpin Home Collection’s IPO was first approved, news of the listing of this classic brand, which represented the customized home furnishing sector, attracted the attention of the entire home furnishing industry.
On the 9th (Beijing time), Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics Co Ltd launched its first set of components for autonomous driving and infotainment solutions it jointly developed with Harman International on Tuesday. This was a major move by the company to expand into the automotive electronics market.
Samsung Electronics acquired Harman International about a year ago.
At the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) held in Las Vegas this week, Samsung unveiled its automotive camera equipped with collision warning, lane-departure warning, and adaptive cruise control, which was also developed jointly with Harman.
Samsung plans to begin shipping this camera system, which is built on automatic machine learning and augmented reality technology this year.
Samsung also exhibited a “digital cockpit”, which allows a car to adapt to the personalized characteristics of the driver even if he or she is not the car owner by accessing the user’s information from mobile devices and cloud.

Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.
It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.
The Williams team also suggested that Massa might return, even though he had already announced his retirement.
January 9 is just a month away from the PyeongChang Winter Olympics. As the Olympic torch relay moves north, warm-ups and intense preparations for the Games were carried out. South Korea was warming up for the Winter Olympics.
Public opinion in South Korea hope that this long-waited North-South Dialog would lead to an “Easter egg” (nice surprise) for the countdown to the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games.
The Winter Olympic torch arrived in South Korea on November 1 last year.
The fervor stirred up by the Olympic torch is directly reflected on the sale of admission tickets for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.
A little over two months ago, the proportion of tickets sold lingered at 32% for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, and a mere 4.3% for the Winter Paralympics. The sluggish ticket sales caused concern among the outside world about the popularity of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics at one point.
However, just as the Chairman of the PyeongChang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games, Lee Hee-Beom predicted, “As the Winter Olympic torch is carried and passed on across South Korea, interest in the Winter Olympics will rise. I believe that ticket sales will turn around very quickly”.
South Korean media reported that as of January 3, the proportion of tickets sold for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics has reached 64%, and that for the Paralympics has also exceeded 50%.
To encourage foreigners to come to watch the Games, South Korea’s Ministry of Justice has also announced on the 8th that foreigners who visit the country for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics may extend their stay for up to 120 days.
More than 1 in 5 US travellers carry prohibited items onto aircraft, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints onto the aircraft, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.
The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contraband past security - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly the most.
As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions
One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.
At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.
"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."

Since the second half of 2009, sales (volume) of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs have remained relatively buoyant. This Spring in particular, sales of Xiaoshan’s seedlings recorded a historic high. Sales volume grew significantly and prices jumped. Statistics revealed that for the first six months of the year, the sales revenue of seedlings in the Xiaoshan District increased by 48% year-on-year, and the magnitude of the growth rate was the biggest in nearly 20 years.
Shi Haiyong, Deputy Director of the Xiaoshan Forestry Bureau, said that the production of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs also grown rapidly along with the positive sales trend.
In the last two years, the planting acreage of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs have expanded by 30,000 mu, with total area at 180,000 mu. At the same time, expansion is being actively carried out outside the region. Xiaoshan’s farmers have been setting up flowering tree and shrub bases totaling 80,000 mu across the country, an increase of 30,000 mu from that in 2008.
While expanding planting acreage, the quality of the seedlings have also continued to improve; the existing value of the nurseries has been rising. More large specimen and high quality seedlings have been preserved, and sellers have been reluctant to sell some seedlings.
Shi Haiyong also said that confronted with the current buoyant peak production and sales period, producers should calmly face and objectively analyze the situation, and take into consideration that the demand for flowering trees and shrubs is long term and will continue to increase. At the same time, they should also be aware that market competition will intensify.
July 13 morning Beijing Time. US-based Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas accusing Apple of infringing on a battery technology patent it applied for in 2010.
The company had previously used the same patent to sue Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.
The lawsuit claimed that iPhone 6s and Apple equipment similar to it have violated US Patent No. 7,657,386, which is known as “Integrated battery service system”.
The plaintiff is seeking monetary damages or royalties on the infringing equipment upon announcement of the verdict.
According to the indictment, the plaintiff appears to believe that iPhone’s fast-charging technology jas violated the former’s patent.
iPhone’s fast-charging function charges the battery quickly until to 80% of its capacity, then switches to slower trickle charging.
Somaltus is actually a so-called “patent troll” because the company does not provide any apparent product or service, and it is hard to find any information on the company online.
However, it has successfully reached out-of-court settlement with auto makers such as Ford and Nissan with this patent.
The meeting believed that accelerating information development; promoting interconnection and integration, as well as efficient utilization of resources; and enhancing the level of digitization and intelligence in industry would have great significance for advancing “Made in China 2025”; entrepreneurship and innovation by the masses; developing new drivers; and raising the standard of living for the masses.

Trump pressured Mexico on border wall payment according to leaked phone call transcripts
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
On 27th January in a phone call to Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US President berated him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him "You cannot say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense exchange.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like "a dope" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call all day."

Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.
"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.
"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to have justice first," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.
But not one was ever prosecuted.
Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer.
Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.
Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.
"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks put it more succinctly.
"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.
Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching because it makes us face the ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you, if you won't hear me, or hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
He's played the part of the head Klansman for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.
"I feel dirty because this is not who I am," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said n---a, get off my property!"
Rascona fires back.
There's a beat.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!," Rascona asked.
He's alarmed, confused.
Did I go too hard?
"No," Greene said through chuckles.
"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"
"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.
"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"
And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic.
Absolutely no one laughs.
The reenactment ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks on every other word.
A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.
They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunted.
As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.
Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.
"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.
He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.
"The reenactment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it also is a teaching moment," he said.
"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.
Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
As regards implementing market-oriented reforms associated with natural gas, the importance of reform with respect to “pipeline and grid independence” is self-evident, but more resistance and controversy can be expected.
On the 7th, reporters learned from Kailuan (Group) that at 11:25 am on the 7th, an explosion occurred at the emulsifying workshop of Kailuan (Group) Chemical Co., Ltd. which is located at Guye District of Tangshan, Hebei Province; 13 operators were trapped at the site of the explosion.
To date, of the 13 people trapped, one has been rescued, and rushed to the hospital for immediate medical treatment, while emergency rescue operations are still ongoing for the other 12.
It is understood that the scene of the explosion has been sealed. The local public security, firefighting, medical and other departments are carrying out rescue operations at the scene at this time.
Eye witnesses said that there was a loud bang when the explosion occurred, and a mushroom cloud rose instantly.
According to the staff of Kailuan (Group) who were organizing the rescue effort at the scene, Tangshan Kailuan (Group) Chemical Co., Ltd., located at Northern Zhaoge Village, Guye District, Tangshan, Hebei Province, is a State approved designated enterprise that produces explosives for civilian use. It was established in 1958, and was formerly known as Kailuan Mining Bureau Factory 602.

US media: Scientists from the Air Force Engineering University of China looking into laser satellite to clean up space debris
Reference News January 18 report US media claims that Chinese scientists have put forward a daring and innovation proposal - to use large lasers to clean up the messy Earth orbit, and destroy old satellites as well as other space debris.
A January 15 report on US “Newsweek” website stated that researchers at the Air Force Engineering University of China have written a thesis on “Research on de-orbiting model of small scale space debris removal using space-based laser”. This thesis described how by using space-based platform lasers, space debris would be rendered smaller and less dangerous as a result of laser radiation.
The report claimed that for years, space debris has always been a matter of concern for international space agencies. NASA has considered many alternative plans to track, probe and remove human made debris.
The methods for cleaning up large space debris include using an enormous net to clean up and collect the debris, as well as using magnetic material to suck them out of the orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted a laser simulation study and arrived at the following conclusion. This will be an effective method for cleaning up the Earth’s orbit.
The abstract of the thesis claimed that “(the simulated study) has provided the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris removal by using space-based laser.”
A 2014 research conducted by US defense industry giant Lockheed Martin revealed that as far as orbiting satellites are concerned, approximately 200 deterrents exist daily.
The high-speed debris of orbiting satellites are regarded as serious threats to future space missions, and have been described by European Space Agency experts as a “series of fatal threats”. High-speed debris has continued to rise annually over the years.
According to a January 17 report on the US-based “Popular Mechanics” website, space is basically empty, but space around Earth has become increasingly crowded. Every satellite we send into space will ultimately become debris orbiting Earth. As time passes, these debris will accumulate.
As debris increase, the probability of a satellite that is still operating normally being hit by debris becomes higher, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of US dollars.
The report claimed that all space agencies have formulated plans to remove space debris in the future.
NASA is considering firing atmospheric gases to reduce the speed of the debris so that it would de-orbit. Europe is looking at launching a satellite with a large net to capture the debris and it back to earth. Japan’s idea is to use a power chain to capture the debris.
At this time, China has also put forward a method of solving the space debris problem, and that is, to use a large laser to shrink the floating space debris into smaller, less harmful pieces.
According to a thesis published in German magazine “Optics”, a group of researchers at the Air Force Engineering University of China claimed that installing such a laser on a satellite would be enough to effectively clean up space; at least, according to the simulated results, that is.
The report claimed that the only way to prove effectiveness is to carry out tests. Currently, there are no arrangements for such as mission, but sooner or later, someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space.
Once this is achieved, we can finally bid farewell to space debris problems for good.

Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business.
The job cuts, which Chief Executive John Fallon said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019, are in addition to 4,000 roles lost in its previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394-million U.S.) in May in a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the year was unchanged after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.05 billion pounds.
A few days ago, the China Athletic Association issued a serious notice to severely beat the phenomenon of running for others, and prepared to punish violators with a lifelong ban.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.
On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."
The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called "2015 Ozone Designations" late on Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a suit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at sparking economic growth.
But the efforts have triggered pushback by Democratics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" like asthma.

Five renowned musicians - Peng Juxin, Yan Zhongkun, Li Chi, Zhu Qi, and “outwardly aloof and inwardly passionate singer” Yu Kewei, served as judges that night.
Before an exclusive interview with a Yangcheng Evening News reporter, Yu Kewei had a sip of alcohol. She felt this would help her loosen her tongue a little. “Super Girl”, “Time Boils the Rain”, Rock Records, EE-Media ...... are the keywords the market has attached to her. She has calmly accepted these terms while trying her best to safeguard her internal purity.
This is also the true state of survival of many singers at this time - they know what the market wants, and they know what they themselves like.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
Best of luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.
"We're the main names.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready ... ."
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.
But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.
They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.
"This is the fight to be made.
No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.
I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.
Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight."

The position stated by National Development and Reform Commission officials as regards achieving the emission reduction target of the 11th Five-Year Plan ahead of time gives the steel industry, which has been subjected to power supply and production quotas, strong expectations of resumption of production.
Although steel plants, as of now, have yet to receive clear notification from local governments announcing that work related to energy conservation and emission reduction has ended, the industry expects that by around December 15, 2010, steel plants nationwide that have been subjected to production quotas will resume production successively. Steel prices could start to come under pressure.
A spokesperson from a private steel enterprise in Hebei told our reporter that notice to end power supply and production quotas has yet to be received at this time, but in reality, pressure on all enterprises have eased significantly when compared to that in September and October.
Some local governments in Hebei Province have repeatedly issued documents related to power supply and production quotas, and have adopted mandatory power shutdown measures to limit production.
The reporter learned from local enterprises that the steel plants of most regions in Hebei have resumed production at this time, and pressure from production quotas have eased.
Mysteel.com analyst Zhang Tieshan estimated that end-user demand for construction steel will gradually weaken as winter has already arrived in Northern China.
Coupled with the energy conservation and emission reduction program winds down, most steel plants will generally resume production by around December 15. Products will gradually make their way to markets across the country before New Year’s Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will exert some pressure on soaring steel prices.

A few years ago, people who were allowed to set foot in the venture capital sector were limited to those who had founded companies and subsequently joined venture capital companies, or analysts who worked in venture capital companies who hoped to further their careers.
Entrepreneurs would be able to more easily raise funds from the numerous investors on the AngelList, and would therefore not have to rely on on agents to put them in contact with top venture capital companies.
CRI Online (Liu Pai): The Economic & Commercial Section of the Embassy of the Republic of Italy in China held a Sino-Italian Cooperation Program for Environmental Protection on the 18th.

The Italian representatives said that Italy has a myriad of environmental protection technologies and solutions in the renewable resources sector, and proposed to carry out pilot programs with the Chinese in three areas, namely, industrial waste treatment, waste oil treatment, and waste incineration and disposal. It also looked forward to promoting its environmental protection partnership experience with China in other regions around the world.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released
The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.
Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.
They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.
To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."
When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.
One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.
The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."
West Virginia governor announces he's switching parties
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.
"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking ... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in cheers.
"So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to run another play."
Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited a coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Fang Wenshan said frankly that using music to tell an entire story is his dream.

Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal
Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty torrid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is reengineered."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.

The RMB middle price is registered at 6.4401, a depreciation of 66 basis points. The rising slows down.

Tencent Financial News on January 18, the USD-to-RMB middle prices is registered at 6.4401, a depreciation of 66 basis points compared with the last trading day, ending the rise spanning five consecutive days.
In the overnight market, the US dollar experienced a V-shaped rebounded, ending at 90.8900 as of 07:30, Beijing time.
The Beige Book published by Federal Reserve shows that almost all 12 Fed regions reported mild to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018. The Federal Reserve remains optimistic about the outlook for this year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. unemployment rate remained at 4.1% in December, the lowest since 2000, and companies are expected to increase wages in the coming months.
Fed officials generally believe that tax reform is a factor supporting this modest strengthening of the economic outlook. The Fed predicts that the economy will increase by 2.5% in 2018 and the interest rate will be raised three times.
Some market observers have point out that the expected tightening of ECB’s monetary policy pushes up the exchange rate of the Euro in recent days. As a result, the US dollar index declines continuously, and the RMB exchange rate against the US dollar has seen a surge in prices. However, the European Central Bank is unlikely to adjust the policy stance soon. After the short-term fluctuation of the foreign exchange market, the exchange rates will eventually return to a level dictated by the fundamentals, and the continued smooth operation of the RMB exchange rate is a high probability event.
It is worth noting that, as the market expects a more stable renminbi, the attractiveness of renminbi assets to foreign investors will also gradually increase.
The People’s Bank of China has authorized the China Foreign Exchange Trade System to release the interbank foreign exchange market central parity rates of the RMB: USD1 to RMB6.4401, EUR1 to RMB7.8482, JPY100 to RMB5.7854, HKD1 to RMB0.82399, GBP1 to RMB8.9017, AUD1 to RMB5.1302, NZD1 to RMB4.6779, SGD 1 to RMB4.8546, CHF1 to RMB6.6731, CAD1 to RMB5.1747, RMB1 to MYR 0.61399, RMB1 to RUB8.8352, RMB1 to ZAR1.9128, RMB1 to KRW165.95, RMB1 to AED0.57030, RMB1 to SAR0.58233, RMB1 to HUF39.3106, RMB1 to PLN0.53093, RMB1 to DKK0.9487, RMB1 to SEK1.2501, RMB1 to NOK1.2240, RMB1 to TRY0.59303, RMB1 to MXN2.9071.

How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.
Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.
That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.
Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.
Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."
Smart interactive robot developer Rokid received new investment; Temasek is the lead investor
In recent years, start-ups in the AI sector have continued to be a hot favorite of capital.
AI Rokid recently completed a round of funding, led by Temasek. Other investors included Credit Suisse, CDIB (the investment arm of China Development Financial Holdings Co., Ltd.), and existing shareholder IDG Capital.

In October 2014, the company again received at least US$10 million in Series A funding led by Walden International, with the Angel investors as participants. On November 1, 2016, Rokid completed Series B funding, led by Advantech Capital; other investors included IDG, Mfund, Vision Capital and Walden International.
At the time, Rokid claimed that after the Series B funding, the company’s valuation would reach US$450 million.
In May 2017, Rokid unveiled its consumer class smart voice robot “Rokid - Pebble”, integrating AI and the home, priced at RMB1,399.
This robot uses speech synthesis, natural language understanding, speech recognition technology and microphone array technology, with conversational, music broadcast and smart home features.
It has won two major CES awards - Tech For A Better World and Home Audio/Video Components And Accessories, as well as Germany’s iF Design Award, known as the Oscars of the design world.
At the 2018 CES which had just ended, Rokid unveiled another new product: the consumer class augmented reality AR glasses RokidGlass.
These glasses are used as independent head displays, and do not require connections to smartphones or external computers. It is expected to be commercialized in 2018.

“Tofu”, a 3D animated feature film designed for a general audience held its premiere in Wuhan on the 25th. Zou Yi, Director of “Tofu”, Meng Zhihui, Animation Director of “Tofu”, as well as Tom Disher, film soundtrack composer and Emmy Award winner were present to share their behind-the-scenes story of the film’s creation.
“Tofu” is based on a traditional allusion concerning Liu An, Prince of Huainan in the Han Dynasty - “Liu An made a mistake and invented tofu”. It is an account of “Dou Fu”, the leading character, a bean who miraculously took on human form, how he overcame numerous difficulties and persevered in his dream to become an immortal. This adorable animated film about becoming an immortal is closely connected with Hubei’s local culture.
Wudang Mountains, located in Shiyan, Hubei Province, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as the place of origin of Toaist culture and Wudang martial arts. It is known as “a unique scenic spot since ancient times, and the premier celestial mountain in the world”.
Director Zou Yi revealed that he and his creative team traveled to Wudang Mountains to conduct research for the film prior to its creation.
He said that the story of “Tofu” occurred during the reign of Emperor Wu of Western Han Dynasty, against the backdrop of Liu An, Prince of Huainan, making pills to attain immortality. The leading character “Dou Fu” was a bean that miraculously took on human form by accident while Liu An was making these pills.
In addition to Wudang Mountains, the place of origin of Toaist culture, Hubei Province is also closely connected with the chime - a traditional musical instrument with long history in China.

Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.
But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
By doubling down on the core gag - middle-age actors playing horny kids coming of age - it made the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.
Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.
It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.
It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football).
And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.
The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.
Reporters learned from recent interviews that the performance of the steel, rail transport, shipping vessel, machinery manufacture and other industries has fallen in general; some have even incurred losses.
Some experts believed that under the present circumstances, a new round of revitalization of the industries in Northeast China will not only concern the nation’s current economic recovery, it will also have an impact on the long-term growth and international competitiveness of China's manufacturing sector. Hence, there is an urgent call for adjustments and structural transformation to take place.
Traditional industries saw a general decline in performance, and even incurred losses. The raw material industry, and the heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing sector saw performance decline significantly, and even incurred losses. These were the first signs from the industries in Northeast China amid the current sluggish economy.
When the economy decelerated in the past, low-end and primary commodities were the most significantly affected. In the current economic fluctuation however, both high- and low-end industrial products of Northeast China’s traditional industries were affected.
A few years ago, Ansteel Group (Weibo) began by adjusting its product mix, and gave priority to developing high-end steel plates such as those for containers, railroad tracks, shipbuilding, and civilian home appliances. However, sales of these product categories fell significantly. In particular, the sales volume of steel plates for shipbuilding plunged 50% year-on-year.
Angang Steel Company (Hao Qingshun, Director of the Metallurgical Department of Liaoning Provincial Industry and Informatization Commission, said that metallurgy was the third largest pillar industry in Liaoning, with annual steel production capacity of 60 million tonnes, ranked third nationwide.
For the first five months of this year, crude steel production in Liaoning Province amounted to 21.54 million tonnes. Sales of products required by projects that were encouraged by national policy and where there was strong local government construction activity was better. Products in which market competition was more intense fell by a larger magnitude. This was another characteristic of Northeast China’s manufacturing sector.
In sharp contrast to being diligent and responsible on reaching adulthood, Daniel Wu was a very mischievous child, even rebellious.
The movie “Once Upon a Time”, soon to be released on August 4, held a press conference entitled “people from all corners of the world have come to meet you” to launch the movie in Beijing yesterday. On-screen “Bai Ye couple” Yang Yang (Ye) and Liu Yifei (Bai) were present at the conference.
Yang Yang, who underwent surgery on his right ear just a few days ago, made an appearance for the first time after his recuperation. He interpreted his character as someone who “does not wear his heart on his sleeve”, quietly giving his all to Bai Qian, and concealing all his feelings.
Yang Yang said that he had to rouse all his emotions to convey the character’s hidden sadness to the audience. “This was certainly a new challenge for me as an actor. While acting this character, I was so emotionally suppressed that I almost suffered internal injury”.
Liu Yifei, meanwhile, revealed that while acting her character in the movie, she cried so much that she collapsed at one point.
The Japanese Olympic Committee recently said that the Japanese delegation was targeted at 30 gold medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and making Japan into the Top Three.
In October last year, Chairman Yamashita Tasuhiro of the Athletes Commission of Japanese Olympic Committee expressed his expectation that the Japanese athletes can win 2.5 times more gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics than at the Rio Olympics.
At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Japanese delegation ranked 6th in the Gold List with 12 gold medals.
The representatives formed their own groupings, and walked to the venue holding umbrellas.
Traffic on the roads surrounding the venue remained normal. There were no balloons or slogans at the venue, nor a red carpet; displays of plants and fresh flowers were absent as well.
Yesterday, the second session of the fourth People’s Congress of Guang’an City convened without much ado.
On entering GuangAn International Convention and Exhibition Center, slogans were absent from the venue, and there were no tea cups; not even a bottle of mineral water was present.
Instead, there a simple banner, a meeting place, a simple recyclable paper document bag containing materials for the meeting and a recyclable paper cup for tea or water.
The meeting materials were less dense than that of the past. A few pieces of paper summarized the theme and the agenda of the meeting.
“Be thrifty for the people. Those whose duty are to be frugal must live frugally. A return to the current simple and down-to-earth meeting environment, we fully comprehend and welcome it.” GuangAn People’s Congress deputy Wang Cheng said that an efficient and practical meeting without formalism is what they want to see and in which they want to participate.
Experts pointed out that both inflationary and deflationary pressures have eased at this time. This was undoubtedly good news for the financial and economic structural transformation stage.

February 10 news: Reporters learned yesterday from Changzhou Municipal Agricultural Committee that on basis of having successfully become a national forest city in 2016, Changzhou will thoroughly implement the “Master Plan for Establishing Changzhou National Forest City, Jiangsu Province (2014-2025)” this year so as to consolidate and upgrade the achievements from establishing a national forest city, and build a green, harmonious and high quality forest city that may be shared and enjoyed by all.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.
The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.
It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.
In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.
The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.
Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.
It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.
The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.
The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-mortgages, many with fee-free options as well as low rates, become ever more popular."

NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000
Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.
Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.
Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.'
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.
The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'

Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.
"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."
Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.
It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.
For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.
The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.
Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.
What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.
"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.
"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.
These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."
It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.

The Ministry of Land and Resources as well as other relevant departments must take the initiative to serve, consider the overall situation associated with the structural transformation and integrated reform experimental zone program, and actively strive for policy support from the State.
July 26 news: On July 22, reporters learned from Hongqiao District that the upgrading project of the city’s largest downtown riverside linear park has been completed, and the park will be opened to the public free of charge.
The entire landscaped zone leveraged the existing natural ecology as well as the strengths of historical and cultural resources, and re-planning as well as upgrading and transformation was carried out on both banks of the South Grand Canal. Five riverside scenic spots along the river were created, namely, “Emperor Yongle’s Ferry Crossing Heritage Park”, “Wellington Plaza”, “Xintiandi Folk Street”, “Tianjin West Railway Station Gallery” and “Shuixi Artistic Heritage Green Corridor”.
Plastic paved pathways of approximately 1,500 meters with distance markers have been built in the green open space on both sides of the river bank between Jinhua Bridge and Xinsantiao Stone Bridge.
In addition to the flowers, plants and trees planted on both sides of the pathway, a children’s playground has been constructed, embellished with various groups of small sculptures.
As you walk along, you will see benches, paved pathways, bridges, riverside decks, sand pits for children to play in, and other amenities. These help integrate the green landscape and water sights into one, offering residents another place for leisure, fitness and entertainment.
Yesterday, a list of 23 players to participate in the China Cup was released by Chinese national coach Lippi, and caused great controversy in the society.
How to deal with China’s renewable energy vehicle “subsidy fraud” has become a matter of serious concern for the public and even the international automobile industry community after the case was exposed in January this year. The State Council has attached great importance to this issue, and has requested rigorous investigation into such fraudulent conduct.
A reason for poor electric vehicle sales is inadequate promotional effort for these products.

Brothers fight over $500 million property empire
Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion three doors from younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up.
Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.
Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.
A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.
Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.
"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I considered to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.
"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."
On Friday, that hope appeared gone.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

The power generated would meet the demand of nearly 750,000 households, and save 250,000 tonnes of coal.
The report delivered by General Secretary Xi in the 19th CPC National Congress has truly struck a chord in the hearts of our people.
I have listened carefully to the report and noticed that our people have been mentioned 203 times, and cultural development 72 times by General Secretary Xi.
Meanwhile, the report has mapped out a comprehensive plan to advance Chinese Dream and the overall development of socialist cultural quality.
After coming back from his performance in Shandong, Meng Guanglu, the delegate to the 19th CPC National Congress and head of Tianjin Youth Peking Opera Troupe
organized his entire troupe to learn the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress.
We should take root among the masses and serve the people, we should come up with fine works and align with the central government from thought to soul. Eulogizing our socialist
cultural confidence is of great significance not only to the cultural confidence of our cultural workers but also to the entire Chinese people.
The report of the 19th CPC National Congress points out,
we must promote the creative evolution and development of fine traditional Chinese culture, see our revolutionary culture remains alive and strong, and develop an advanced socialist culture. We should cherish our cultural roots, draw on other cultures, and be forward-thinking.
We should do more to foster a Chinese spirit, Chinese values, and Chinese strength in order to provide a source of cultural and moral guidance for our people.
The day after the Congress was concluded, Zhang Jian, a delegate of the 19th CPC National Congress and prima ballerina of the National Ballet of China,
left on a tour to perform at the grassroots level.
She will perform in the folk ballet, “Red Detachment of Women”, which premiered more than 50 years ago, and has been staged more than 4,000 times.
We have been making efforts.
So in the following five years, we should continue to create works that belong to our nation and which reflect the humanistic spirit of the socialism for a new era.
Therefore, we should display the era adequately in our works.
According to the latest news, the People’s Daily for tomorrow will publish a commentary, saying we should make a greater contribution to mankind as well as learn and implement the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress from eight perspectives.
The article points out, the 19th CPC National Congress takes the following as its mission, using new thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, and addressing problems for mankind.
In this way, the dreams of Chinese people and those of the people all over the world will reinforce each other and continue to usher a new situation for great power diplomacy with Chinese characteristics.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.
Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews.
Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.
This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.
That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.
No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How'd that work out?
Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later.
Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.
Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Tourism charm town: How does charm mesmerize tourists
[Abstract] The potential of small towns in Zhejiang is gradually unleashed.
Today, these little towns have become key destinations for visitors to Zhejiang who come to admire the natural scenery, savor Zhejiang culture, and feel nostalgic about Zhejiang. They will also become key drivers to help the Province create “Picturesque Zhejiang”, China’s most beautiful tourist destination.
Reputed for Local Custom
"Village theatrical performance is staged as the moon rises, while the pleasant smell of delicious sausage spreads with breeze."
Walking through the Anchang Ancient Town in Shaoxing, you can see hoop buckets, bamboo knitting, ironmaking, shoes stitching, lace making, cotton spinning and other traditional handicraft techniques almost everywhere, which fully represent the intangible cultural heritage of the Anchang Ancient Town. Tourists all over the world are enchanted to experience the folk customs and feel the atmosphere of Shaoxing's historical and cultural experience.
It is reported that during the three-day New Year's holiday, more than 65,000 tourists visit Anchang Ancient Town.
In Zhejiang, a town with a unique style such as Anchang Ancient Town is scattered all over like stars. The glittering waves of Jiaxing Xitang is flowing with the warmth and gratefulness of the lower reaches of the Yangze River in the south; the white walls of Quzhou's Nianbadu Ancient Town convey to us the changes over time in the town; and the murals of fishermen in Shitang, Taizhou draw a picture of their life, both traditional and modern. These towns are the "palm treasure" of Zhejiang tourism and also the favorites of tourists from all regions.
In recent years, with the promotion of tourism construction throughout the whole region, the potential of Zhejiang’s small towns have been gradually awakened.
In 2016, the provincial government office issued the "The implementation of the creation of a tourist town in Zhejiang Province”, which proposed that the province would accept and name about 100 tourist towns with strong folk customs, beautiful ecological environment and rich tourism industries after 5 years or so.
Today, these little towns have become key destinations for visitors to Zhejiang who come to admire the natural scenery, savor Zhejiang culture, and feel nostalgic about Zhejiang. They will also become key drivers to help the Province create “Picturesque Zhejiang”, China’s most beautiful tourist destination.
The responsible people of the Provincial Tourism Bureau established that with the rise of these tourism style towns, we must now pay more attention to the construction of the personalized tourism industry and new tourism projects and formats emerging one after another. These have brought rich experiences to tourists and earned glowing reputations.
Emphasis on promotion
Recently, directed by the Zhejiang Provincial Tourism Bureau and Zhejiang Daily Press Group, the Tourism Full Media Center of the Zhejiang Daily Press Group hosted the “Towns × Future artists" sharing session and the 2017 promotion season of Zhejiang style tourism towns, "Poetic Zhejiang, Towns with folk customs”. The closing ceremony took place in the Zhejiang exhibition hall.
“A style town has artistic beauty and living warmth.
The style of the towns lies in the original sense, flavor and township, which represents the original purity.
Xie Hanfeng, a teacher at the School of Film and Television Animation Arts of China’s Academy of Art, the domestic A-list film and television advertising director, and Professor Xu Xianghong, the dean of the School of Art and Communication at China Jiliang University, talked about the cross-border stories of towns through Towns in the lens and Reconstruction of small village.
Many scenic tourist towns in Zhejiang have deep cultural resources. Dong Xinjian, a town deputy from Nanxun, Huzhou, appeared in the site in person and interpreted Nanxun as a traditional Chinese painting.
The style of towns in the south of the lower reaches of the Yangze River have been popular with painters since ancient times. Nowadays, the Nanxun Ancient Town is developing in-depth cooperation with art academies such as the China Academy of Art.
Tourism style towns must be equipped with elements of style, tourism, service and the environment.
Among these, tourism service facilities and the environment are very important.
If the tourists are handed in an umbrella on a rainy day, they can better experience the town’s style.
In the era of sharing, the Tourism Full Media Center of the Zhejiang Daily Press Group teamed up with the hottest shared umbrella company to customize a number of shared umbrellas in “Poetic Zhejiang” style, hoping to promote the concept of “Sharing and Green”, spread the awareness of civilized tourism and public morality among tourists and residents, and create a shared, beautiful tourist environment.
This has become a bright spot in the 2017 promotional season of Zhejiang’s tourism towns, "Poetic Zhejiang, Towns with folk customs”.
Expecting wonders
Up to now, Zhejiang Province has released the list of the first 21 provincial-level tourism towns that will ultimately culminate in a grand total of 115 provincial tourism towns.
As the prior area for the development of rural tourism during the “13th Five-Year Plan” period, the style towns will eventually be built into tourist attractions with a grade of 3A or higher, becoming a new model for tourism product diversity, tourism benefits and industrial integration.
What makes tourism style towns attractive is their authenticity and originality.
The beauty of the tourism style towns not only stems from the misty bridges and rivers, but also from a long history of cultural tradition; the revitalization of the country is due to cultural self-confidence.
Throughout the world, the tulips of the Netherlands’ Lisse Town, the salt of Austria’s Hallstatt Town, and the pumpkins of Pumpkin Town in France, have been attracting a large number of tourists from all over the world each year. This has allowed the realization that tourism could help the economic growth of smalls towns as well.
For the style towns, the point “Emphasis on characteristics and retention of nostalgia” has given the towns a distinct personality and soul, further providing cultural permeation, carrying local cultural traditions, and highlighting native civilizations.
Tourism style towns, with culture and nostalgia as the link and humanities and scenery as the carrier, connect tourists all over the world while inherit and innovate the traditional customs and cultures in the co-construction and sharing process.
Essentially speaking, the tourism style town is a complex open-style tourism area, and it should be a shared living space for local residents, exotic tourists and even sojourners.
As the main battlefield for tourism growth in the future, tourism style towns will change the rural ecological landscape, economic and social development patterns, and the flow direction of industrial factors. Additionally, they will play an important role in eliminating the urban-rural infrastructure gap, hastening rural cultural recovery.
In the wake of accelerating revitalization of the countryside, Zhejiang tourist towns will receive a more abundant and wonderful story.
Figures indicate that 70% of China’s travel demand is concentrated within a 3km radius. On this basis, the short-distance travel market will become a bike sharing paradise sooner or later.
A report in “The Nikkei” claimed that inflationary pressure will increase because of the expansionary fiscal policies of the next Trump administration. The pace of interest rate hikes will also accelerate in 2017.
The annual International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), held between January 9 (January 10, Beijing time) and 12, opened in Las Vegas, USA.
According to the list of exhibitors published by the official CES website, the 51st CES attracted 4,577 corporate participants from around the world.
Compared to the massive 13,000 TV dramas broadcast by satellite TV each year, these “terminated dramas” are but a drop in the ocean.
Travellers negotiate trench, return to 'Millionaire's row'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.
Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.
Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.
One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.
The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.'
She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'
One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'
The Fifth Session of the 12th National People's Congress held its closing ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 15.
This is an interview with Ma Junsheng, Director-General of the State Post Bureau.
Xinhua News Agency/Chen Yehua/CRI Online: The Fifth Session of the 12th National People's Congress held its closing ceremony at the Great Hall of the People at 9am on March 15.
Prior to the closing ceremony, Ma Junsheng, Director-General of the State Post Bureau, expressed during an interview at the “ministers’ passage” that the State will strengthen supervision over prominent issues that currently exist in the express delivery industry such as late delivery and loss of or damaged parcels, and guide and enhance self-discipline in the industry.
Ma Junsheng said that efforts to resolve four major prominent issues in the express delivery industry will be enhanced this year. The development of the express delivery industry in China has entered the express lane.
In 2012, express delivery volume in China stood at 5.6 billion items, and at least 10,000 express delivery three-wheelers were deployed. A single standard, a unique logo and a unified insurance were implemented, which facilitated delivery and ensured safety.

Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.
Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant change or impediment" to its rescue operations.
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Lian Ping, Chief Economist of the Bank of Communications, said that as value added of industry for each of the first three quarters of 2017 was stronger toward the end of the quarter, the growth rate of value added of industry in December could accelerate to 6.6%.
Cumulative growth rate of fixed asset investment in December is forecast to be at 7.2%, unchanged from the previous month, but lower than that a year ago.
Industrial production, while weaker than that in October, will remain generally unchanged from that in November.
Investment in China’s manufacturing sector was low in December, but infrastructure investment improved slightly. As such, fixed asset investment for the month will remain the same as that in November.

Beijing’s new measure to “shift and relocate institutions of higher learning”: 10,000 BUCT teachers and students move into new campus at Changping
The opening ceremony of Beijing University of Chemical Technology’s (BUCT) new campus was held at the Changping District of Beijing on the 2nd, and school officially commenced at the 1,800 mu green campus.
Reporters learned from the ceremony that for the purposes of enhancing the capital’s core functions, and treating “large urban center diseases”, on the back of cooperative development among Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province as well as the shifting and relocation of non-capital related functions, Beijing has accelerated the program to shift and relocate institutions of higher learning situated in central districts to suburban districts in recent years. The teachers and students of some institutions of higher learning are relocating in batches to new campuses in Shunyi, Daxing, Fangshang and other suburban districts.
BUCT’s new campus is located in Nankou Town, Changping, and sits on a land area of 1,800 mu, some 40 km from the city. It is a key project of Beijing’s shifting and relocation of non-capital functions.
The new campus was constructed in three phases. Phase I is now entirely completely, and Phase II is expected to commence by the end of the year. On completion, the learning and living requirements of close to 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students as well as faculty staff are expected to be met.
At this time, a review of this year’s film market will show that fans of the original book of a film adaptation and those of the actors taking part in film have become key components of the expected audience of the film.
At 17:10 today, the 119 command center at Shaoyang received an emergency call. Tetrahydrofuran stored at Hongzhi Chemical Plant at Longxutang, Shuangxi District, caught fire.
Shaoyang fire station immediately dispatched five detachments and 20 fire trucks with heavy chemical protective clothing, chemical cleaning vehicles and other equipment to the scene.
Preliminary investigation revealed that the cause of the fire was the small tanks in which tetrahydrofuran was stored. There was thick smoke at the scene.
At the time of filing this report, firefighters were in the processing of carrying out emergency rescue. The City’s health, safety administration, environmental protection, public security, traffic and other departments arrived at the scene successively. No fatalities or injured persons were found.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to better her own.
She has not accepted responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Zhang Yimou is destined to controversial film artist. From when he began filming his first movie, “Red Sorghum”, he has always been a trendsetter in Chinese films, but he has also received a lot of criticism.
On the 2nd, reporters learned from Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club that the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth Team came in fourth at the National Youth Basketball League Finals held in Beijing.

The players’ self-confidence and grasp of the game have increased significantly. Their exchanges with other teams were also more comprehensive, and exchanges both on and off the court have also increased and were more relaxed.
After the competition ended, captain Jiang Cuo said that he hoped to gain experience from taking part in the competition, and do his best for Tibetan basketball.
It is understood that during the competition, the players had to overcome factors such as low altitude sickness, displaying the image of Tibet.
The fact that track and field involves the most gold medals in the Olympics makes those athletes confident a lot, the famous players have been disadvantaged in the competition.
Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the moves as recalls.
European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.
The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.
Taking a couple of years, or even a few years, to make a film from planning to release is nothing unusual.
“Big Fish & Begonia”, an animated feature film 12 years in the making, recently announced that it would be released on July 8th.
Liang Xuan, the author of “Big Fish & Begonia”, dropped out of his studies at the Department of Thermal Engineering at Tsinghua University when he was 21, and founded B&T together with best friend Zhang Chun. In 2008, Ce Yuan Ventures provided US$1 million in risk investment, kick-starting the maiden animated film, “Big Fish & Begonia”.
The film was already a recipient of multiple local and overseas awards at the creative sample stage. It has been included in the Centre Pompidou’s collection and acclaimed as “an outstanding artwork”.
As it took six years from creation to production, the film was known as a “super deceiver” by millions of fans who were looking forward to its release.
“Big Fish & Begonia” is a Chinese fantasy. The announcement of the trailers for the scheduled release has once again led to new expectations among all viewers.
Liang Xuan said, “I’ve only done this one thing in the last 12 years. Now it has turned from a dream into reality. I’m both nervous and excited”.
Zhang Chun said, “I kept thinking of using one-fiftieth of other people’s budget to come up with an image effect that was completely identical to these other people’s. I drove our entire team up the wall.”
Dongguan, the “Factory of the World” which once made its fortune on industrial processing and large numbers of general workers, is looking to high-level talent to help the city reposition itself.
The Dongguan government recently held a high-level talent week event. Reporters from China Business Network noticed a number of reputable local enterprises participating in the talent fair.
On the bright advertising board against a tangerine colored wall, they listed their respective exorbitant price tags.
Therefore, China Television Drama Production Industry Association will work together with the television drama production industry nationwide to sign a self-discipline convention.
Provence lavender under threat from climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change.
Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."
And a lot is at stake.
As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.
Compared to the sci-fi elements in the movie, the two lead actors said that it was the movie’s plot that attracted them.
On the afternoon of September 5, West China City Daily reporters consecutively interviewed numerous renowned personalities in the cross talk circle, as well as two cross talk artistes. What was surprising was that they were unanimously silent most of the time.
One is a Silver Bear Best Actor, the other, an up-and-coming young actor; “Guilty of Mind” is the first partnership between Liao Fan and Li Yifeng.
A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security.
It's important to change their routines, they are told.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.
Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.
His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.
Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.
"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.
The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two errors contributed to the killing.
First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.
Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.
He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.
"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.
Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?
His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.
"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting one's instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape constantly shifts.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.
For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.
There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.
Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.
Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a wrenching decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.
And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.
Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.
From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.
If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.
Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"
Size of China’s self drive tourism market may exceed RMB1 trillion by 2020
[Abstract] Against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading and widespread popularity of free-and-easy travel, self drive tourism has received support from national policies, and is welcomed by an increasing number of consumers.
At the same time however, the self drive travel market, the size of which is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion, is confronted with twin challenges.
Against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading and widespread popularity of free-and-easy travel, self drive tourism has received support from national policies, and is welcomed by an increasing number of consumers.
At the same time however, the self drive travel market, the size of which is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion, is confronted with twin challenges. On the one hand, the development of the self drive travel industry is out of step with market demand. Self drive travel organizers such as self drive clubs and travel agents are confronted with meager profits. On the other hand, self drive travel ae confronted with infrastructure and services that are still in their infant stages.
Accounting for 60% of total tourists in domestic tourism, with market size expected to exceed RMB1 trillion
In 2016, domestic tourism numbered some 4.44 billion persons, with self drive travel accounting for approximately 60% of total tourists in domestic tourism. By 2020, the size of the self drive travel market is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion.
Statistics concerning the number of persons engaged in self drive travel published by China Tourism Automobile And Cruise Association showed that the number of persons engaged in self drive travel has continued to grow over the last five years. The share of such tourists as a proportion to domestic tourists has stabilized at above 50%.
At the same time, all regions as well as the State have shown greater concern and support for self drive tourism, this new emerging sector. From 2016 to 2017, a slew of policies and regulations relevant to vehicles for self drive travel, and motorhome and camping tourism have been promulgated.
In July 2017, eight government agencies including the China National Tourism Administration and the State General Administration of Sports jointly issued the “Plans for the Development of Automobile Campsites for Self Drive Sports”. In the same month, in the “Action Plan for Advancing Quality Enhancement and Upgrading in Rural Travel Development (2017)“ jointly printed and circulated by 14 government agencies including the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance, self drive travel was mentioned as a priority.
The introduction of policy measures has provided opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self drive travel.
Self drive travel clubs make meager profits; complete industry chain is key
Although there is enormous potential in the self drive travel market, and active guidance from national policy measures, the self drive travel industry is still at its infancy stage.
According to the “2016-2017 Annual Report on the Development of China’s Self Drive Travel Industry”, domestic self drive travel clubs, automobile clubs and automobile enthusiasts clubs number in the thousands, tourists who arrange their own travel itinerary account for a larger proportion. The proportion of tourists who join automobile enthusiasts clubs, self drive travel clubs and other such entities only account for about 15%.
Meanwhile, there are only a handful of online tour companies and traditional travel agencies that develop proprietary products for self drive travel. Many online travel platforms only sell self drive travel products provided by some suppliers. Some self drive travel clubs are also key suppliers.
In terms of organizing self drive travel activities, this encompass various aspects including “board, lodging, transport, travel, shopping, entertainment”. Fragmentation is high, and upstream supply chain heavy. There is also significant randomness in tourist spending.
Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of Beijing XTX Auto Club, believes that self drive travel clubs are similar to travel agencies in essence. The primary earnings model at the initial stage are mainly based on offline activities. The core areas are self drive travel route products and guide services.
However, there is significant product homogeneity in route products within the self drive sector, and the standard of guide services is mixed. Self drive travel clubs are again confronted with the need to restructure.
It is quite apparent that self drive travel is not an independent industry in and of itself. Rather, it is an inter-regional and -industry ecosystem based on movement characteristics of self drive travel. The creation of a complete industry chain is key.
Experts have pointed out that in addition to basic tourist consumption, experience is a more important consumption element.
Hence, with regards to the development of the self drive travel industry, the experience feature should be enhanced. A “self drive travel +” theme as well as self drive travel product IP should be developed.
Scenic routes are not merely roads, and automobile campsites should not merely meet board and lodging requirements
Confronted with the rise in self drive travel, the development of self drive travel infrastructure is similarly still fairly rudimentary.
Li Guanjie pointed out that scenic travel routes are not merely a road. Rather, traffic and tourism elements should be integrated into it. However, building roads and tourism are the responsibility of two separate department. The increase in tourism element by transport departments are still stuck at the level of building rest rooms, information centers, publicity bulletin boards and other such facilities. Their degree of bonding with the tourism is low.
These could draw lessons from the building experience of the renowned self drive route of “US Route 66”,
The design of scenic routes is no longer the most direct and fastest route from the place of origin to the destination but adhering to the design concept of “experience the joy of driving” so as to provide self drive travelers the best enjoyment of beautiful scenery along the route. Scenic routes are able to connect spots and facets of the travel landscape. These would help retain the historical value and cultural value of the eco-tourism resources along the route. Meanwhile, various thematic activities may also be held to enhance tourist participation and recreation experience, creating economic benefit for the local tourism industry.
In addition to scenic routes, campsites are also important supporting facilities for self drive travel.
However, a Beijing News reporter understands from self drive travelers that few consumers would choose to stay at campsites.
They believe that many campsites are infrastructure and can only meet board and lodging requirements. Considered low class with dull product features, they are unable to meet the multi-faceted demands of self drive travel.
An industry insider who wished to remain anonymous said that a few years ago, enterprises operate campsite mostly for the purpose of acquiring land. After they acquire the land, follow-up development of complementary infrastructure and services have not caught up. These operators are loss-making, and do not have later-stage capital injection. Hence, providing corresponding complementary products proved very difficult.
Consumer groups
Data published by the China Tourism Automobile And Cruise Association in 2017 showed that in terms of age, self drive travelers are concentrated in the 21-40 age group, mostly in the 31-40 cohort. This group has a certain level of income, and are relatively demanding in terms of customized travel. Many are family oriented customers.
A survey in lodging revealed that self drive travelers prefer non-standard lodging.
In terms of self drive travel categories, driving in neighboring areas is the predominant category, accounting for 84. 32%.
Self drive travel overseas is a dream for many, but the proportion is still relatively small.
Meanwhile, with higher consumption demand, tourists who enjoyed self drive “tour of sights” have begun to change their opinion. Instead of “alighting to take photos, and boarding to sleep” during the self drive travel process, they are now more concerned with the travel experience and process.
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.
It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'
The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'
The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.
After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.
'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.
They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.
It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.
'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.
'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.
The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.
The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.
Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.
Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.
I can count the scales on its sole.'
Reporters understand that adding alginate, humic acid and amino acid nutrient carriers of natural or plant sources into the production process of urea would change modify and enhance the benefit of traditional urea. The alginate urea, zinc fulvate urea and aminoglutanic acid urea nitrogen utilization rate was 5 to 10 percentage points higher than general urea.
In a positive environment, an increase in crop yield potential will be significant; in particular, large value-added urea pallets are quality raw materials for bulk blending fertilizer.
The total number of security personnel is double that of the 2012 London Olympics.
In order to ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will start the largest ever security linkage plan.
Earlier, Brazil government has said that a total of 85,000 troops and polices, including 20,000 troops and 65,000 polices, will fight together for the security of the Olympics.
Most troops will be responsible for safeguarding the Olympic venues, while the new 3,000 troops will be responsible for the security of international airports, subway stations and streets.
The polices will patrol around other areas of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
It is reported that 6,000 soldiers have arrived in Rio and provided security services for the Olympics.
In addition to the four competition areas, they will also patrol airports and main roads connecting airports to the Olympic venues.
Appraisal mechanisms in the services sector are nothing new. The key to having these appraisal mechanisms play an effective role is to have more effective supervision, rather than being a mere formality.
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.
Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.
The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."
"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.
"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'
In that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.
It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."
"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.
"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.
Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.
There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.
They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.
Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It all just came."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.
"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.
Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."
Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.
"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."
Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Online translation services were actually already available on the Internet a decade ago, and in fact, a very long time ago, there was a prevalent view that “machines will replace human translation”.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the room at New York's Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, each bearing an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.
By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.
From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.
That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.
There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.
When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."
In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.
"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."
The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.
It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand.
"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.
"I get goosebumps still talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.
That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very gruesome.
Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.
Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
As far as computers are concerned, whether Chinese checkers or chess, defeating humans was already a clinch decades ago.
The president of Croatian Football Association Davao Suk said in an interview that participation in the China Cup is very meaningful for Croatian football, and the Chinese Cup’s bonus was considerable.
Forget purchasing agents! These 8000-plus products enjoy zero tariff
At the regular press conference of the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) held on January 11th, spokesperson Gao Feng said that to date, China has 15 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) in force, involving 23 countries and regions, encompassing more than 8000 imported products at zero tariff.
Meanwhile, you no longer have to spend a lot of money to have purchasing agents buy the products you want such as imported cosmetics, salmon from Iceland, red wine from Chile, tropical fruits from ASEAN ....
Currently, China has signed 16 FTAs, involving 24 countries and regions, of which 15 have come into effect, encompassing more than 8000 imported products at zero tariff.
Take agricultural produce for example. The implementation of the FTAs has meant that consumers can now sample affordable agricultural produce from different places of production throughout the year.
For instance, import tariffs have been cut to zero for the following products: tropical fruits from ASEAN such as durians, lychees, and pitaya from 15-30% previously;
salmon from Iceland, from 10- 12%; and
red wine from Georgia and Chile, from 14-30%.
Specialty agricultural products such as beef and milk powder from New Zealand have also seen a relatively large reduction in tariffs.
Industrial products have benefited as well. For example, import tariffs for some cosmetics from Switzerland have been reduced to zero, while
that for some watches have fallen to 50%, and will fall further to zero in a few years’ time;
products from South Korea such as refrigerators, rice cookers, massage devices, and cosmetic apparatus will now be subject to a lower import tariff of 40%, and fall further to zero in a few years’ time;
and consumer electronics and other relevant products have also seen a relatively large reduction in tariffs.
Products at zero tariff under the FTAs also include intermediates and raw materials required for the domestic production of end-user consumer goods, which will, to a certain extent, also upgrade the mix of domestically produced consumer goods.
MOFCOM spokesperson Gao Feng said that approximately one-third of China’s total imported products enjoy tariff concessions under the FTAs, of which the majority are end-user consumer goods, thus providing tangible benefits to consumers.
Further reductions in import tariffs of consumer goods
On December 1, 2017, China further lowered the import tariffs of some consumer goods. The reductions covered 187 eight-digit HS codes comprising food, health supplements, pharmaceuticals, chemical products for daily use, clothing, footwear and headgear, home appliances, culture and recreation, miscellaneous and sundry goods, as well as other consumer goods.
The average tariff rate of these consumer goods more than halved, plunging from 17.3% to 7.7%!
With effect from January 1, 2018, partial adjustments were also made to other import and export tariffs.
The import tariffs of lipstick, eye shadow, perfume and some other cosmetics fell from 10% to 5%.
This decline in tariff rates means that consumers do not have to have a purchasing agent or travel overseas to buy the foreign products they like.

Foreign press: Year-end return policies at US malls vary widely; be cautious when returning gifts
China News Service, December 29
US-based “World Journal” reported that there was a wave of gift returns just after Christmas.
A report by American Broadcasting Company (ABC) revealed that approximately half of the goods sold last Christmas were exchanged or returned.
Elsewhere, readers had repeatedly reported having been cheated while shopping online. Shoppers should be on their guard when shopping at unofficial websites.
In general, large shopping companies have official and reasonable return procedures, but if you have shopped for gifts at certain small stores or online, you must be careful.
A Madame Hou of Rowland Heights bought a jacket from an online store specializing in print jackets for more than $60 (USD, the same hereinafter) on December 1, local time, but has yet to receive her purchase.
She sent an email to customer service but did not receive any reply from the store.
Elsewhere, a netizen revealed that when on tour in the US last year, he bought a mobile phone from a third-party seller, but received a box of plasticine on delivery instead.
After he realized he was deceived, he applied for a refund from the website. Fortunately, he was able to receive a full refund.
Nonetheless, some customers felt that website refund services are not perfect.
Mr Wang, an ethnic Chinese resident of Northern California, purchased goods at a certain website on urgent delivery services twice at a cost of $4 each but both times, the goods failed to arrive promptly.
He applied for a refund subsequently but did not get a reply.
Large department stores or shopping malls have better return policies.
Most of Macy’s merchandise may be returned for a full refund within 180 days,
but the merchandise has to be in its “original” state, and the customer has to produce proof of purchase such as the receipt or the bank purchase record.
Without proof of purchase, the customer may also receive the store’s credit which may be used to purchase other merchandise.
Target has a 90-day return deadline for general merchandise. For electronic products, the deadline is normally 15 days,
but it is extended to 30 days for electronic and entertainment related products purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017;
note that the 30-day return deadline begins on December 25, i.e., merchandise purchased must be returned by January 25, 2018.
The ultimate shopping experience with the advent of a new era in commercial district shopping development
More than 10 years ago, China was, on the whole, still a sellers’ market. Selection was limited, and so was demand.
A decade hence, the market has long developed into a buyers’ rather than that of a sellers’ market. Shoppers have now become a lot more demanding as well, and are no longer satisfied simply with a “cash on delivery of goods” shopping behavior.
Therefore, how to offer shoppers the ultimate shopping experience has become the next competitive point for real estate developers.
Of the many factors that affect a shopper’s shopping experience, the impact of shopping centers in business districts is the most important.
Let’s take a look at how urban builders focus on the shopping experience.
No two leaves are alike, nor can one find two completely identical shopping malls. A famous shopping mall must have its own characteristics.
Take Turkey’s world-renowned Kanyon Shopping Center. Its unique undulating architectural design was inspired by the Grand Canyon, hence its homophonous name Kanyon. You feel like you’re in the Grand Canyon when walking along the 200-meter footpath in the midsection of Kanyon.
In addition to the canyon-like design, there is a large unique inward concave oval-shaped performance venue in the middle of shopping center where specialty performances are often held.
Its open platform design offers visitors at every floor a view of the activities held in the “canyon”, and the scene changes as you take each step.
In China, the Nanjing Forest Mall Commercial Street, known as the country’s first forest style pedestrian consumption venue, is a perfect integration of shopping and ecology as well as fairy tales.
With a 7,000 sqm green plaza, and a 3,000 sqm rooftop water feature, the project is made up of nine individual buildings, linked by a sky bridge. The sunken garden design for the entire project, plane trees as its architectural surface, and the rooftop water feature create the feeling of being in a forest.
On entering the Forest Mall, you’d feel like you have accidentally fallen down the rabbit hole in Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland. The tall tree trunks surround the buildings, and the lawn and stream are beautifully juxtaposed, drawing the masses into a forest full of life and vitality.
Then there is Chonqing. The Lijia Waterfront Business District built by Longhu Properties has plans to attract a diverse range of businesses, and expects to bring in more than 50 world class flagship stores, with more than 100 world class brands and over 500 renowned foreign and domestic brands so as to create a commercial center with a distinctive theme that brings the services sector together.
In addition, the Lijia Waterfront Business District will also integrate ecology into architecture. Based on a transit-oriented development (TOD) concept, it integrates shopping, household services and amenities, dining, entertainment, education and sports, providing shoppers the ultimate shopping experience while affording them the luxury of enjoying Chongqing’s unique “waterfront culture”, a perfect blend of shopping, and water entertainment and recreation.
From the above examples, it is noted that, at present, a number of real estate developers have noticed the discovery of this new urban business phenomenon. Insiders indicate that this consumption model which is centered on the consumer experience and which explores the means to combine shopping and experience will become the mainstream of urban development in the future.
Today’s business districts are no longer merely the distribution centers of goods. Rather, they are more integrated venues that bring together the arts and culture as well as creative themes; they also carry the responsibility of the masses toward urban living.
Therefore, in addition to meeting the one-stop material needs of dining and entertainment of consumers, maximizing the transmission of multi-tiered cultural and artistic spiritual needs, as well as bringing the livable qualities of residential needs into play will inevitably become the high point of future business district development.
In Chongqing, Guoxing Property’s Beianjiangshan is located north of the Yangtze River, close to Guanyin Bridge, where the who’s who of world business and international giants agglomerate, and first class brands congregate, affording a seamless connection with international fashion.
Here, prosperity abounds, and the best in the world agglomerate.
Dongyuanjinyue, which is in the immediate vicinity of Nanping Business District, has a better shopping environment. At its sole disposal is Western China’s, and indeed, the nation’s leading four-story three-dimensional transportation system, enhancing shopping comfort.
Elsewhere, the landscaped gardens and shops along the two pedestrian streets at Huigong Road and Wanda Plaza have been upgraded, with approximately 300 trees planted, and 40,000 sqm of floor space revamped, lifting the image of Nanping Business District.
Meanwhile, Longhu’s Waterfront City, in the immediate vicinity of Chongqing’s first low-density waterfront business district - Lijia Waterfront Business District - is surrounded by nine parks. The commercial street district is low density with good access. These qualities have made shoppers more willing to stay, stop and slowing savor the joy of shopping when shopping, rather than being jostled by crowds of shoppers into rushing forward. Here, “shopping at a leisurely pace” is truly achieved.
Competition will only intensify going forward. In a market of rampant homogenization, how to achieve success, and attain a reputation as a “shopping mecca” in the hearts of future shoppers deserve serious consideration among all real estate developers.
A differentiation strategy alone is far from sufficient. Only developers that truly place shoppers in their hearts, empathize with shoppers, and offer shoppers an ultimate yet simple shopping experience will be able to stand tall in a market when assailed by intense competition.
To be sure, I believe that, at the end of the day, Chongqing’s residents are the happiest lot to have such excellent shopping experience and business districts. A decade ago, no one would have imagined today’s prosperity.
Shopping carnival: Consumerism revelry masks true environmental cost
RMB168.2 billion. That was the amount of money Tmall users spent over a 24-hour period on November 11, 2017 at the “Tmall 11.11 Global Shopping Festival”.
Specifically, in the span of three minutes right after the “Double 11” commenced, Tmall’s transaction volume surpassed RMB10 billion, and exceeded RMB20 billion in six minutes and five seconds; within nine hours, it broke through the RMB100 billion mark.
That day, shoppers all over the world made a total of 1.48 billion payments by way of Alipay, an increase of 41% year-on-year.
Such spending resulted in 812 million logistics orders.
Whether the Tmall shopping platform or the Alipay payment platform, however, both belonged to Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group.
Ten years ago, no one would have imagined that the “Singles’ Day” subculture which was a self-deprecating celebration created by singles on November 11 would be co-opted by e-commerce merchants, and turned into a phenomenal “Singles’ Day” shopping carnival today.
Alibaba used the “Great Singles’ Day Sale” marketing gimmick: Not dating? Singles, come shop online - for the first time on November 11, 2009.
The outcome was a surprise. That day, transactions at Taobao Mall (the predecessor of “Tmall”) surpassed RMB52 million, 10 times that of the normal daily transaction value at the time.
From then on, “Double 11” has become a shopping festival created by Alibaba, and has grown and expanded from a domestic buyer-seller amusement to an inflow of global merchants. Nine years hence, and the more than RMB100 billion worth of transactions of Tmall’s “Double 11” is now more than 3200 times that of the first year, far outstripping that of “Black Friday”.
Numerous e-commerce merchants have followed Tmall’s “Double 11” sales promotion, with “JD.com” the strongest competitor.
“JD.com” has its own shopping festival “6.18” but its impact is less than that of “Double 11”. From November 1 to 11 this year, “JD.com”’s accumulated sales amounted to RMB127.1 billion.
The “Double 12” discount extravaganza and the Christmas-New Year shopping period come right after “Double 11”.
Following the New Year, pre-Spring Festival’s Lunar New Year shopping as well as Valentine's Day shopping await the Chinese consumer. Retail consumption knows no holiday.
Massive instantaneous consumption has led to environmental problems, which has attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
A Xinhua Daily Telegraph report revealed that based on the industry’s general standard conservative estimate of 0.2 kg per packaging cartons, at least 300,000 tonnes of trash were generated during this year’s “Singles’ Day” period.
Liu Hua, Director of the Pollution Prevention Program at Greenpeace East Asia told chinadialogue that the volume of orders at this year’s “Singles’ Day” from Tmall alone would generate 160,000 tonnes of packaging trash.
In 2016, the State Post Bureau published a report stating that approximately 780 million items were delivered by express couriers during the 2015 “Singles’ Day” period (November 11-16), with more than 3 billion woven bags, 9.922 billion packaging cartons, and 16.985 billion meters of adhesive tape used. The length of adhesive tape used could go round the equator 425 times.
This year, the State Post Bureau estimates that the “Singles’ Day” express business volume could surpass 1.5 billion items.
Wang Shi, manager of a waste incineration plant in Beijing told Xinhua News Agency that more than 2,000 tonnes of trash enter the plant each day after “Singles’ Day”, exceeding the treatment capacity of the incineration plant.
Express delivery companies have also become aware that the environmental pollution resulting from the express delivery sector should not be ignored.
Some e-commerce logistics enterprises, including Suning, have introduced plastic express delivery boxes that may be recycled and reused ahead of “Singles’ Day”, as well as recyclable packaging such as shopping bags and trash bags that may be used repeatedly. However, acceptance among consumers who could not be bothered was low.
Jack Ma, on Weibo, has also called on the logistics industry to support “green packaging” and “green logistics”.
This Weibo received more than 68,000 “likes”.
What sort of mobile payment do Germans want?
Zhang Dongfang: The mobile payment war waged in Germany is nothing new.
All WeChat Pay and Alipay did was to move the battleground to Europe. Neither the competitors nor the battleground has changed - the Chinese; is this really globalization?
Where there’s Alipay, there’s WeChat Pay.
According to the agreement with Germany’s electronic payment services provider Wirecard, WeChat Pay officially entered Germany in November this year. The Chinese company has also gradually expanded its presence among merchants in Europe.
This time round, the reunion of the two “fellow countrymen” in a foreign country took place in Europe.
All along, Alipay and WeChat Pay have been riding high on the road to globalization.
In a study on China’s mobile Internet payment’s globalization methods, iResearch Consulting’s “2017 China's Third-Party Mobile Payment Report” arrived at two methods: The first method would be by way of strategic investment, outward transfer of experience, taking an equity stake, and supporting the overseas local mobile payment enterprise;
the second method would be by way of promoting mobile payment services to overseas merchants through Chinese tourists’ overseas spending behavior, thereby changing overseas local entities’ recognition and acceptance of China’s mobile payments.
Indeed, win over the Chinese, and you win the world.
China’s rapid economic growth coupled with its large population base have meant that spending by Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure,
but this also means that the mobile payment war waged in Germany is nothing new.
All WeChat Pay and Alipay did was to move the battleground to Europe. Neither the competitors nor the battleground has changed - it’s still the Chinese; is this really globalization?
A more groundbreaking inquiry would be whether China’s mobile payment can expand its territory in Europe.
Germany is an example.
Magical “new retail”
Chen Xinlei, Yang Kaihan: When Amazon made it to the world’s top 10 list of retailers, it announced that it would venture into the bookstores and grocery stores; this is worth pondering, both in terms of opportunity and motive.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle. This was followed by two bookstores in Portland and San Diego.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened its bookstore and New York, and planned to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced that its checkout-free grocery store Amazon Go would begin trial operations. No waiting in line or checkout is necessary. All customers have to do is scan their QR code on the Amazon Go app to enter the store, take the products they want and leave. The shopping amount would be charged to the customers’ Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, its sudden but frequent forays into physical stores in the last few years have been very unexpected.
This is because way back in 2007, CEO Jeff Bezos, in his “Letter to Shareholders”, highlighted that Amazon would not arbitrarily start a new business (such as a physical store) unless the four conditions set out below are met simultaneously:
1. We must convince ourselves that the new opportunity can generate the returns on capital our investors expected when they invested in Amazon;
2. we must convince ourselves that the new business can grow to a scale where it can be significant in the context of our overall company;
3. we must believe that the opportunity is currently underserved; and
4. we have the capabilities needed to bring strong customer-facing differentiation to the marketplace.
Bookstores and grocery stores are the two most precarious physical retail sub-sectors, and were the first to be knocked out after the rise of Amazon.
When Amazon made it to the world’s top 10 list of retailers, it announced that it would venture into these two physical markets; this is worth pondering, both in terms of opportunity and motive.
Did Amazon do something in contrary to the guarantee it made in its letter to shareholders?
Similar words were echoed at the other end of the world. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at The Computing Conference 2016 held in Yunqi, Hangzhou, Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma said in his keynote address that,
“From next year onward, Alibaba will no longer talk about ‘e-commerce’.
The era of pure e-commerce firms will soon come to an end. E-commerce will no longer exist in the next 10 to 20 years, replaced instead by ‘new retail’.
Only by combining online and offline operations will new retail come into being.”
In an instant, it was as if the words “new retail” took on magical properties, and became the new catchphrase of industry insiders.
So what is “new retail” exactly?
If it merely referred to online-offline integration, then the concept is nothing new.
In 2016, eMarketer, after tracking 180 of the largest e-commerce firms, estimated that total sales of e-commerce firms amounted to approximately US$200 billion, of which the largest 25 accounted for more than US$159 billion;
and of these 25, 18 were traditional retailers that had only begun online operations in the preceding five years (such as Macy’s, Nordstrom, Target and Gap).
Indeed, Alibaba Group's RMB28.3 billion acquisition of an equity stake in Suning Commerce Group was still fresh in the minds of the public.
From a global perspective, both retailers and e-commerce firms are transforming from a single channel to a multi-channel retail system that encompasses physical stores, e-commerce, mobile terminals and social media.
Could Jack Ma’s “new retail” be more of a conclusion rather than a forecast for the future?
If not, then what is the difference between the multi-channel concept and “new retail”?
Perhaps, the crux of the matter is not whether online and offline entities would integrate, but how.
A review of the retail sector in the last 20 years has revealed that the rise of e-commerce was similar to the emergence of discount retailers many years ago; both were focused on price and convenience.
On the basis of these two trigger points, e-commerce firms moved highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, online from offline.
As online retail habits formed, and customer experience continued to rise, e-commerce firms further extended their scope to other product categories, and began to increase efficiency.
In Aliababa CEO Daniel Zhang’s words, “Use the thinking behind and technology of the Internet to thoroughly reform and upgrade the approximately 30 trillion retailers in society at this time, so that the increasingly demanding retail requirements of Chinese consumers may be effectively met. This will make the entire goods production, circulation and services process more efficient with the extensive application of the Internet and big data.”
Thus, the path of e-commerce firms is asset-light on the surface, but asset-heavy in reality.
“Light” refers to fixed assets, headcount, management processes and other burdens that are less than that of traditional retailers; “heavy” refers to areas such as logistics and storage that require enormous investment.
Changes in logistical methods ensured the efficiency of e-commerce firms.

On January 18, Alibaba held an e-commerce poverty eradication summit in Chongqing, and announced that it would explore a new “Internet + Poverty eradication” model to help spur measures targeted at eradicating poverty and revitalize the rural economy.
This follows Alibaba’s rural strategy, launch of the Rural Taobao program, online rural revitalization and poverty relief platform, as well as the founding of the Alibaba Poverty Relief Fund, and is a step-up commitment by Alibaba toward combating poverty.
Combating and eradicating poverty is presently one of China’s key national strategies.
Complete eradication of poverty is unprecedented in the history of China.
“Poverty relief via e-commerce is a new round of innovative measures aimed at poverty relief and development. It is an important means to achieve measures targeted at poverty relief and eradication.
The Central government very concerned with this issue and has indicated that the Internet can play a part in helping to combat poverty, advance measures targeted at poverty relief and eradication, as well as allow agricultural products to be sold outside the countryside via the Internet.”
As such, Alibaba had proposed a rural strategy as far back as 2014, which together with big data cloud computing and globalization are its three major core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Alibaba launched the Rural Taobao program, recruiting “village partners” to help lift villagers out of poverty and move toward affluence by way of e-commerce.
In 2017, Alibaba worked together with the Ministry of Commerce to create a rural revitalization and poverty relief channel that is now connected to a total of 13 provinces and 120 national level poverty-stricken counties.
The Alibaba platform has incubated 2118 Taobao Villages,
of which close to 400 have emerged in poverty-stricken counties of various provinces, and 33 in 13 poverty-stricken provinces.
In 2017, at Alibaba’s China retail platform, nationwide sales of Taobao Villages amounted to RMB120 billion.
Daniel Zhang said that confronted with the national strategy to combat poverty, Alibaba has been thinking about how it could effectively use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovative competencies within the Alibaba economy to help develop a new path for poverty eradication.
Rural Taobao, in particular, is a major platform to help eradicate poverty via e-commerce, and has opened up a new online direct supply and sales link to help eradicate poverty.
At planting phase, Rural Taobao and Ant Financial Services have jointly offered means to acquire agricultural resources and tools as well as obtain micro-loans.
In 2017, of the 832 national-level poverty-stricken counties, 795 were served by Ant Financial Services, which provided convenient payments, credit and other relevant services.
Cainiao helped with warehousing and logistics, while Tmall was responsible for selling. Alibaba Cloud’s big data provided feedback and guidance on agricultural production, further raising the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of the agricultural produce.
The growth in poverty eradication via e-commerce not only requires products, sales channels and industry planning, it also requires talent.
By way of the e-commerce courses conducted by Taobao University, Alibaba teaches farmers standardized, quality and large-scale methods of cultivation, achieving a combination of “Poverty relief + Knowledge support” so that poverty eradication among farmers is sustainable.
These courses have already reached approximately 92% of national-level poverty-stricken counties.
The “philanthropic mentality, commercial means” poverty eradication thinking can also ensure that Alibaba will “genuinely perform poverty relief” when carrying out poverty relief activities.
Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma once said that eradicating poverty should be divided into three phases - poverty relief, poverty eradication and becoming affluent.
Poverty relief is to give someone a fish; poverty eradication is to teach someone to fish; and becoming affluent is to build a “fish pond” for farmers so that farmers can breed fish.
Poverty relief through industry development led by e-commerce is building that fish pond.
In terms of poverty relief through industry development, Alibaba has partnered Luochuan County in Shaanxi Province to create a Luochuan apple poverty relief through industry development model, which has been replicated and promoted nationwide as a model by relevant departments.
Alibaba’s poverty relief via e-commerce initiatives have also won the recognition of decision makers.
E-commerce firms, represented by Alibaba, have been given the message that farmers would see an increase in production and income with the help of online and offline channels.
Some village partners and Ant Financial staff have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their poverty relief via e-commerce experience.
Currently, the China office of The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has already partnered Rural Taobao in implementing a poverty relief through industry development program in Anhui and other areas.
Sina Finance news. The “3rd New Economy Think Tank Summit” jointly organized by Ali Research Institute and the China Visionary Think Tank Forum was held on January 16. Zhang Li, deputy director of the e-commerce research department at the Ministry of Commerce Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation attended and addressed the Summit.
She believed that our globalization had in fact ignored the most fundamental issues, i.e., those related to the essence and form of globalization, as well as issues associated with phases of globalization.
As a result, many believed that globalization has stagnated. Moreover, in the new phase, many developed and developing countries hold different attitudes toward globalization and its pattern.
The second concept is concerned with issues related to the intermediate phase of globalization. What constrains the intermediate phase of globalization?
The reason why globalization is constrained by the economic environment and fundamentals is precisely because changing economic fundamentals have led to constraints on globalization.
Zhang Li believed that adjustments to the global economy have generally come to an end at the end of 2017. A new growth phase, will begin in 2018, and growth will be driven by producer goods.
JD’s first fresh food supermarket 7FRESH officially opened for business recently, and plans to set up more than 1,000 stores nationwide in three to five years.
Together with Alibaba’s Hema Supermarket, Yonghui Superstores’ Super Species, Suning’s SUFRESH, Meituan’s Zhangyu Store, and others, “new retail outlets” have begun to emerge in clusters, and have even “challenged” each other on price in this innovative model.
The fresh food supermarket war has escalated, and have become a phenomenal topic in the new retail sector. Just what is new in new retail?
“We will rapidly expand nationwide in 2018, and will open a large number of stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival,”
Hema Supermarket CEO Hou Yi revealed the company’s new approach for 2018 at the 2nd New Retail Summit on the 10th.
“With effect from 2018, Hema will not merely be a fresh produce e-commerce firm; rather, we will be a general household goods and grocery e-commerce firm that meets consumers’ requirement for prompt delivery service.
The core model calls for conduction and experience in offline stores, while genuine sales are done online.”
Unlike traditional hypermarkets and supermarkets, Hema Supermarket is, in the eyes of many consumers, a popular Internet store that is fun and has good food. Some intermediaries have even come up with the concept of “He district housing” (housing within a 3km radius of a Hema Supermarket).
Both online e-commerce platforms and offline retail stores have their respective strengths and weaknesses, and consumers are present at various channels. Therefore, both parties are attempting the multi-channel model.
Industry insiders believe that against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading, more “Hema type” stores will be opened in 2018.
Meanwhile, Hema has continued to widen its product scope, expanding from fresh foods initially into other consumer goods. This suggests that more innovation in the retail market will be forthcoming in the new year.
“For instance, the integrated online-offline business model has attracted consumer eyeballs. Fresh foods supermarkets that have opened across the country have been popular among and welcomed by the masses.”
“Nonetheless, these relationships are useless regardless of how much you talk about them or how cool they are. At the end of the day, it’s all about whether or not you have given consumers a good experience. Only after I have had an experience would I be willing to foot the bill.”
As far as RT-Mart’s feiniu.com CEO Yuan Bin is concerned, under the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed; and shopping requirements have changed as well.
Originally, there was a clear demarcation between online and offline; offline wanted to defeat online, and online wanted to counter-attack offline. Now, on the other hand, it’s become a partnership, because consumers no longer see a difference between online and offline.
Capital, competing for a slice of the pie, has made the retail market, represented by fresh food supermarkets, a powder keg.
Analysis shows that at present, new retail competition in Tier 1 cities is still a long way from a red ocean situation, and there is still plenty of Tier 2 cities yet to be explored. Enormous opportunities and potential exist in the market.
New retail plans proposed by different types of industries will lead new retail development into a state of diversified growth.
CCTV-2 and the National Academy of Economic Strategy, CASS have compiled a stack of dry goods, i.e., this weighty annual report on the development of the e-commerce industry in China.
What sort of report card did China’s e-commerce industry receive this year?
What are the growth trends of the global e-commerce industry?
Let us reveal the results one by one.
Total sales volume set a new record while growth returned to the acceleration track
China’s online retail sales have been sky rocketing since 2006. This may be attributed to the fact that online shopping was still a very novel idea at the time. Shopping without leaving home; cool!
Since 2013 however, the online retail sales growth rate has decelerated from more than 50% to less than 40% for the first time in 2015; in 2016, the growth rate was 26.2%.
The situation changed this year, however. Online retail sales accelerated again. For the first nine months of this year, growth rate rebounded to 34.2%,
significantly higher than the growth rates seen in 2015 and 2016.
Perhaps shoppers took a detour but eventually realized that retail therapy does wonders for one’s mind and body.
In particular, online retail sales of physical goods amounted to approximately RMB5.08 trillion, while online retail sales of services amounted to nearly RMB1.49 trillion.
This comprised 13.6% of total retail sales of consumer goods, up nearly 3 percentage points year-on-year.
Wake up, students. It’s time to highlight the key points. Online retail sales of services was definitely a major contributor!
Elsewhere, per capita online shopping of French netizens who are obsessed with online shopping amounted to US$1,925. Goods they purchased online are primarily clothing, worthy of being called a nation of fashion lovers.
Who says those who love online shopping most must be young?
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.
Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
So she called in outsiders for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.
"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.
Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.
"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.
"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.
Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.
Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.
Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.
But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?' "
Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.
And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.
Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."

The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices makes for a long day for the Bruins
It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.
Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.
For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.
Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.
"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices, designed to lighten the load on players, has actually lengthened their days - at least until finals end Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.
The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.
"We're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.
I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."
UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will have security," Mora said.
"That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice.
If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we got.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place."
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) revealed that in the second quarter of this year, residential property prices in Australia nationwide rose by an average of 1.5% to 2%, and were 3.5% higher on an annual basis, the lowest annual growth rate since March 2013.
Just when real estate agents were looking forward to selling more real estate during the holiday season, growth rate of residential property prices was the lowest since 2013.
IT Home reported this morning that Wall Street Journal claimed that AT&T has canceled plans to sell Huawei’s new flagship smart phone in the US.
Huawei’s original plan was to announce this partnership at the CES this week, but AT&T canceled the partnership at the last minute.
In a January 9 response to a Bloomberg reporter as regards this turn of events (January 9 US local time), Huawei said that it would release its new product and specific listing information to the US market.
Huawei indicated that in the past five years, it has already launched high-end products worldwide and in the US market, proving its strength and competence.
According to the earlier IT Home report, Huawei will unveil the “best smartphone you’ve never heard of” in the afternoon of January 9 at the CES held in Las Vegas. The battery life of this model could support two days of continuous use.
Industry insiders generally believe that the flagship mobile phone Huawei will soon unveil is the Huawei Mate 10 Pro equipped with Android Oreo.
Yangcheng Evening News reporter Wang Li. The film “I Am Not Madame Bovary” starring Fan Bingbing, as well as Guo Tao, Da Peng, Zhang Jiayi and others, will be released nationwide on September 30.
Yesterday, the film held a workshop with the theme “Sorrow in Comedies” in Beijing. Feng Xiaogang, Ning Hao and Da Peng attended the event.
Alternating circular and square image composition; the director was simply willful What was special about “I Am Not Madame Bovary” was the alternating circular and square image compositions. In particular, the circular frames shot with a hooded lens were fresh and interesting.
Feng Xiaogang explained, “ This theme was very similar to Director Zhang Yimou’s “The Story of Qiu Ju”, so it’s very easy for many to lump the two together. So I started to think how I should shoot the film using a method no one has used before. Actually, it wasn’t really a very special idea. I just thought it’d be fun to do something a little different.”
Feng Xiaogang said he regarded the work as his maiden work, and learned how to shoot circular frames from the camera people. He even spent a few million to allow the camera people to shoot a 10-minute pilot.
Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook is to send more potential hoax articles to third-party fact checkers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, potentially showing fact-checking results under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe, with French voters deluged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly, ahead of elections there in September.
On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog.
She added that Facebook would keep testing its "related article" feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news.
Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story
In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from its cosy seat in Bewl River valley in Kent, now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal connection, to hold that letter in my hand."
Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light.
To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes it feel like they're there, too.
Ah, I love archives!"
For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations.
Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and get writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as "hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."
Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.
Just let it go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.
"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
"The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought, a riot is a good place to start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a knack for wooing heiresses."
With his assignment in the castle over, Rhodes is on the hunt for other singular writing experiences.
He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney holds a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"It was like: 'Ah, I've got to go deal with fucking real life now.'"

All large energy companies are “extremely wealthy”. So which energy company in the world makes the most money?
Yesterday, PFC Energy published its 2011 list of the Top 50 largest listed energy companies. US oil and gas producer ExxonMobil retained its top position with a market valuation of US$406.3 billion, closely followed by PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell.
PetroChina topped the PFC rankings twice in 2007 and 2009, while ExxonMobil ranked first place position for the other years.
Three companies from Mainland China made the 2011 Top 50 list. In addition 2nd place PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC were ranked 9th and 15th, respectively.
According to PFC’s statistics, ... Nonetheless, although current oil prices are far higher than that four years ago, PFC Energy’s CEO said that the lower combined market valuation was attributable to a number of factors, including lower North American natural gas prices, and less buoyant global stock markets.

Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
There is going to be new US immigration plan to modify Green Card rules, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the president.
The draft law is due to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do this by changing the way the US issues Green Cards to citizens from other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current scheme.
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, have financial resources to support themselves and show skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
The inaugural China Fireworks and Firecracker Safety and Environmental Protection Expo will be held in Liuyang on May 29.
The two-day event will be focused on the theme “Technology, Safety, Environmental Protection”. Then, the most advanced fireworks and firecracker machinery, the safest and most environmental friendly fireworks and firecracker raw and auxiliary materials as well as new products in China’s fireworks and firecracker industry will gather at Liuyang.
A large number of experts and entrepreneurs will be invited to this Expo to carry out academic exchanges in the fireworks and firecracker industry, and to share the latest technological achievements on fireworks and firecracker safety and environmental protection.
In particular, the exhibition for mechanized equipment for the production of fireworks and firecrackers as well as safe and eco-friendly products will be held at Dayao Town.

For the purposes of optimizing the environment of scenic areas, and building a beautify Nanyue, the “636” voluntary service team of the Nanyue District Tobacco Monopoly Administration (Branch Company) carried out a “hiking to protect our forests and love our hometown” environmental protection event.
The event received the support of all the cadres and staff of the district Tobacco Administration, and also attracted retired cadres as well as the staff’s families, who came to participate in the environmental protection activities. Three generations of people from the elderly to children worked together, hiked up the mountain to protect the forests, and cleaned up rubbish, contributing their own effort to building a “beautiful Nanyue”.
This voluntary service event was aimed at protecting the scenic resources of Nanyue, and propagating the voluntary service concept of “care for others, care for society, and care for nature”. It also served to teach and pass on to the next generation the virtue of voluntary service.
It is understood that since the “636” voluntary service team was founded in early April this year, the 16 members have carried out a series of voluntary service activities including visiting needy retail customers, helping tobacco farmers care for tobacco leaves, and making donations to the Ya’an earthquake victims, and have become a team of committed voluntary service activists that convey positive energy from their hearts.

The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.
Yep.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.
"People snigger about them, but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow-up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-like responses achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.
But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing "personalities" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customise their robots according to the traits they find appealing, such as shyness.
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality," the True Companion website enthuses.
So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.
She also has moods during the day just like real people!
She can be sleepy, conversational or she can 'be in the mood'!"
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real, human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the rapey connotations of making a move on Frigid (read: resistant) Farrah, are the most concerning.
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.
However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.
Most men, naturally, are not going to keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain, for now, on the outskirts of consumer culture.
But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.
And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.
There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but, right now, it doesn't feel like a large one.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical likeness to actual women (albeit with porn star proportions) as technologically possible.
Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, for them to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, pointedly, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots do not represent real women.
They cannot break up with their companion, or walk out.
They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude.
They are pleasant slaves, in other words.
Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.
“The Great Wall” tells the story of a Chinese elite troop in ancient times that battled valiantly against the monster Taotie on the world renowned Great Wall of China.
The last episode of “Hurry Up, Brother” Season 4 has been recorded. Deng Chao, leader of the “Running Man Team” was interviewed via WeChat by the reporters of Shenyang Evening News and syd.com on May 30. From “Super Scholar” in “Running Man” to “Funny Villain” in “Devil and Angel” to “Decadent Guy” Chen Mo, the impression Deng Chao gives to the audience is that of a “flexible transformer”, constantly changing.
Deng Chao said, “I won’t do the same thing over and over again in my acting career. I want to renew myself constantly.”
Trump's great feat?
Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.
Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and who's long been at loggerheads with Republicans in our family, has been visiting me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.
Around the dinner table this is surely a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it carries significant risks.
The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.
When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his antics may one day cease to appal.
There is an even scarier long-range scenario, however, in which what Trump "normalises" are rightwing Republicans who, held up against his standards, suddenly seem the epitome of reasonable.
I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will merely have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine.
The horses are thunderously huge, the fibre-glass designs on the central cylinder - all gurning clowns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister, and the tinkling music oddly transporting.
So many of the cliches of a city disappoint: views from tall buildings get old, skylines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.
In a department store this week, on the other hand, I was required, before swiping my credit card, to rate my transactional "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but to put pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood grinning apologetically while, wearily, I gave the experience of handing her my credit card five stars.
Oscar Pistorius taken from jail to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has left jail for a hospital visit.
Last year he was taken to the hospital for treatment to cuts on his wrists, which prison authorities said he sustained after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her multiple times through a toilet cubicle door at his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed he mistook his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder hiding in the cubicle.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius faces having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

Two Bulgarians Were Detained For Illegal Camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Foreign Affairs Ministry announced, quoted by bTV.
A group of illegally camping people, including the two Bulgarians, was detained by the police in Sithonia in the morning of August 1.
The same day they were released, while an investigation is currently underway.
The ministry of foreign affairs reported bTV that Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone who is caught resting in a place not intended for the purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court may impose a fine.
On May 18, the Ministry of Finance issued the “Administrative Measures for Special Rewards and Subsidies for the Structural Adjustments of Industrial Enterprises”, and will arrange special rewards and subsidies amounting to a total of RMB100 billion to help advance reduction of overcapacity in the coal and steel industries.
Recently, many local governments including that of Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang have proposed reform opinions on reducing overcapacity.
In particular, many provinces have even proposed to actively lobby the Central Government for fiscal support to reduce overcapacity in their respective provinces.
One proof is that the overcapacity reduction target for coal announced by a mere eight provinces already account for 90% of the coal overcapacity reduction plan nationwide.
At an interview with reporters, Lin Boqiang, Dean of China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy at Xiamen University, believed that merely relying on the Central government’s RMB100 billion to “reduce overcapacity” in the steel and coal industries is far from sufficient. More funds should come from local governments and enterprises. How should that be done?
In the detailed implementation rules for reducing surplus coal capacity issued recently by Shanxi Province, it was proposed that Shanxi Coking Coal Group should be restructured and transformed into a state-owned capital investment company, its assets and businesses should be reorganized and consolidated, and a new business model constructed.
The actual funding gap could be 3 times that of the subsidy. Earlier, Yin Weimin, Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, said that initial calculations showed that a total of 1.3 million employees in the coal industry and 500,000 in the steel industry were required to be resettled as a result of “reducing overcapacity”.
Nanfang Daily news (Reporter/Xie Qingyu) The reporter learned from the provincial environmental protection office today that the 2012 results of the environmental protection credit rating of key sources of pollution are being published.
Ratings showed that of the 1,251 enterprises listed on the environmental protection credit management register, 134 were not rated temporarily because of production stoppage, not having been checked and accepted, having been shut down, and/or other reasons.
Of the enterprises that would be rated with a red card, heavy polluters such as those involved in electroplating, printing and dyeing, and prevention and control dominate. A number of waste water treatment plants were also listed.
The provincial environmental protection office said that in order to reflect the principles of openness, impartiality and fairness, it welcomes public supervision, and has publicly released the rating results on the website of the environmental protection office.
During the period when the results were publicly released, the environmental protection office received phone calls, letters, visits and many other forms of feedback from the public concerning such issues, which will be investigated, verified and dealt with by the environmental protection office.

Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut.
Lead investigator Dr Marco Colonna explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don't sneak into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.
Professor Colonna said: 'We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'
He suggested if the same works in humans, a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.
She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.
The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.
Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.
However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of delivering three of his four priority signings.
"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.
"I will be happier if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me."
The global spree of frigates building If China does not build this type of warships, will it fall behind?
With the recent announcement of the construction of new types of frigates by major naval powers in the world, it seems that frigates have become the focus of attention of the major naval powers overnight. First, Japan has decided to purchase two new frigates in the 2018 annual defense budget, finally making a substantial breakthrough for its DEX frigates program. Later, Lockheed Martin of USA recently published the latest arrangement for the United States FFG frigates program. How about China's plan for building new type of frigates?
With the launching of the latest model of 054A frigate at the end of 2017, the number of 054A frigate has reached 29, approaching the sum of the 053H series frigates. Since the first 054A was launched in 2006, the history of building 054A has extended to 12 years. Building such a large number of high-performance general purpose frigates is very rare in the history. Apart from China, the only comparable accomplishment was made by the United States in the 1970s and 1980s when it built a host of 'Perry' class frigates.
And the reason why it is necessary to build so many 054A frigates is simple, that is, it is affordable, easy to operate, and doing so can make up for the deficiency of Chinese Navel that has beset the Naval for many years.
The 054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese Navy for many years thanks to its high cost performance and good combat effectiveness. With a displacement of 4,000 tons, the warship is equipped with a 76-mm main gun, and shared launching system for 32 HQ-16 and Fish-8 anti-submarine missiles, 8 YJ-83 anti-ship missiles and 1 Z-9 helicopter. Although it was first built in 2006 and was designed even earlier, its combat effectiveness is not too bad even by today's standard. It can be ranked as medium- to high level frigate among all the frigates in the world.
However, it is a warship designed at the beginning of the 21st century after all. Armaments aside, its propulsion system and electronic radar system lag significantly behind the current mainstream frigates in the world. Considering that similar frigates in Europe have been equipped with full electric propulsion, small multi-function phased array radars and large helicopter decks, it is time to develop new models.
Then how should China develop its new frigates? This has a direct bearing on its future orientation and the strategic direction of Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will inevitably aim at becoming the blue water navy, roaming in the vastness of the oceans. It should be able to deploy rapidly in areas that are closely related to China’s vital interests and demonstrate the presence of force. If necessary, it will use powerful combat capabilities to ensure that China’s vital interests in the region are not compromised. So, it seems that the new models of frigates will surely be huge ships that can roam the blue water.
Let's look at the positioning of the new frigates in the future rank and file of Chinese Navy. The future Chinese Navy should be similar to the US Navy. In addition to the necessary offshore defense ships, the other main ships will form an aircraft carrier battle group or amphibious attack group as the situation requires.
The new frigates in the future aircraft carrier battle group should play the primary role in anti-submarine and short-range air defense operations. In the amphibious attack group, they should provide protection to ships. According to these requirements, the new frigates must have strong anti-submarine capability and good mid-range air defense capability.
Based on the above positioning, we can boldly imagine the rough appearance of the new frigates in the future.
First, the displacement will be increased significantly compared to the current 054A model. It is estimated that the displacement of the new frigate will reach about 5000-6000 tons. The ship will be equipped with a comprehensive electric propulsion system that combines a QC280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines, improving the maximum speed to around 30 knots and significantly increase the cruise range. As for the weaponry, the 76mm main gun and 1130 near-range anti-aircraft gun will be retained, but a HQ-10 launch system will be added. A shared vertical launching system for 32-48 unit HQ-16 modified missile and Fish-8 missiles will be furnished at the back of the main gun. A large 8-16-unit vertical launching system should be furnished at the middle-to-rear section of the hull for the launch of YJ-18 and new cruise missiles. Hangars and parking platforms will also be expanded for the parking and storage of two 10-ton helicopters. As for the electronic radar systems, the high grade model will be equipped with a small four-sided fixed phase-control array radar developed based on 346A. the low grade model will be furnished with multi-function rotating phased array radar similar to the ones on European frigates.
Thus, the overall level of the new frigates will edge into the world's top bracket, even comparable to the FFG frigates of the USA.
Of course, these are only the author's conjecture on domestically produced new frigates. Only when the new frigates are launched into the water can we know the truth. Let's anticipate the day.

In recent years, our city has encouraged enterprises to actively participate in the construction of national or industry standards as well as regional group standards. An award of RMB300,000 will be given to enterprises that are principals or that participate in formulating standards for the Made in Zhejiang team, and RMB500,000 awarded to enterprises that have passed the Made in Zhejiang brand certification. This is the most generous award given out in the Province, and has incentivized enterprises to benchmark themselves against the standards.
Recently, at the production workshop of Wonly Group, Gao Jian, head of the Group’s companies, and its staff were working together to pack and send a burglar-proof door to Shaoxing Quality Inspection Center as a sample for the Made in Zhejiang team’s benchmarking and standard achievement work.
Just a couple of days ago, Wonly had passed the on-site inspection of the “Made in Zhejiang” certification expert team.
Gao Jian said that the professional team made up of industry technical experts and the quality certification organization commended the Group’s performance in terms of quality excellence, proprietary innovation and other core aspects, and unanimously believed that the Group had achieved the standards in all respects. If Wonly’s product were to pass the subsequent inspection, it will become one of the first enterprises to have achieved and passed these standards.
Wonly Group is but an epitome of standards driving industry toward structural transformation.
Buyang Group and Qunsheng Group are also enterprises in the city that are carrying out the Made in Zhejiang team’s benchmarking and and standard achievement work.
Since our City formulated the Made in Zhejiang standards for the burglar-proof doors industry last year, Xinyue, Simto and other enterprises have also actively applied to undergo benchmarking.
In recent years, a flood of capital has flowed into the film and TV market, and the profile and remuneration of actors have risen rapidly. Producer He Jing once revealed that two actors of a certain hit drama which was being filmed were earning salaries of close to RMB100 million. In the end, they only acted for two days; their doubles took care of the rest of the film.
In the present situation where actors taking on roles in several dramas simultaneously is popular, lead actors and actresses would be at different sets at the same time. This has meant that they would not be able to appear at the same set at the same time. As such, film crews have been forced to use doubles to ensure the film schedule.

China's household debt ratio is close to the United States. Is being unable to repay loan more frightening than being unable to afford a home?
Recently, everyone has been talking about the recent changes in real estate policies. Is it true that real estate policies have been loosened? Is the diversification of land supply going to bring down the housing prices?
However, just when we were worried about real estate prices, macroeconomic controls and the future trend of the real estate market, the People's Daily published an important commentary once again. Last time we discussed how People’s Daily had set the tone for the regulation of real estate market through a commentary. This time, the commentary of People's Daily deals with a topic that is more serious than the affordability of housing: can you repay the loan even if you can afford the down payment of a mortgage?
Today, let's discuss the question more serious than buying a house: repay the loan.
I. China's growing housing debt crisis
The People's Daily Overseas Edition published a commentary titled “Awards and Loans: The Joy and Worries of Struggling Young People” on January 17th. The article cited some data from an report on the progress of nationwide financial deleveraging in the 3rth quarter jointly published by the National Laboratory of Finance and Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Center in November 2017. According to the report, the leverage ratio of the residents' sector continues to climb, rising from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, an increase of 1.3%, which amounts to an increase of 3.8% in the first three quarters of 2017.
The residents sector accounts for an increasing share of the total debt in the real economy, and the leverage ratio has risen rapidly.
Relevant studies have shown that Chinese households' debts in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, which account for about two-thirds of residents' debts, which is about twice that of business loans.
Among the consumer loans, medium- and long-term loans dominated by housing loans accounted for about 80%, but short-term consumer loans grow faster than medium- and long-term loans.
Moreover, the household debt ratio figure obtained in the study is only reflects the total amount of credit that the household sector obtains from financial institutions. In fact, many Chinese households borrow money from private sources including relatives and friends, creating a large amount invisible loans.
Seeing such data, one cannot help but be stupefied. According to the statistical data of Suning Financial Research Institute, the leverage ratio of Chinese households was only 3% in 1996 and 18% in 2008. But this figure doubled in just six years since the trend of rapid growth of leverage ratio set in, reaching 36.4%. By the third quarter of 2017, the leverage ratio of households has reached 48.6%.
Let's make another comparison. In May last year, HSBC issued an investigation report involving 10,000 respondents in 9 countries.
The investigation was targeted at young people in the millennial generation (born between 1980 and 2000) in nine countries.
The report pointed out that China's young people who were born in 1980s and 1990s have a home ownership rate of 70%, far ahead of Mexico at the second place (46%), and twice the US level (35%).
These figures reveals that compared to the problem of being unable to afford homes, the biggest risk of 'Grey Rhinoceros' for Chinese residents at present is likely to be being unable to repay debt.
2. Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have analyzed previously, although we have been saying that China’s housing prices are relatively high, China’s housing ownership rate is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world. So the urgent question facing a lot of friends is whether you can replay the loan rather than the question of whether you can afford a home.
A quick review of the real estate market in the world leads to the conclusion that China’s real estate market hasn't experience major crisis except for the localized crisis in Hainan Province as we mentioned before. This is because commercialization of property is a relatively recent phenomenon in China. However, it's alarming to note that the real estate crisis in the United States triggered a global financial tsunami in 2008, just a decade ago.
The blame for the real estate crisis in the United States falls on two financial institutions: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
In the so called 'golden age' of the United States, real estate companies sold their houses with very low down payments to the low-income people in order to expand sales. When the US economy was prosperous, the real estate market was also thriving. However, it did not last long. The stagnation of growth in the U.S. economy caused the income of home buyers to fall, which in turn caused the consumption expenditures of a large number of households began to decline.
Most U.S. families had both financial assets and real estate assets. At that time, almost all household assets of the low-income families were real estates, while the majority assets of the top 20% high-income families were financial assets. As a result, poorer people in the United States have higher debt ratio.
A grave reality is that these people bought their houses when the economy was prosperous, so the money to pay the mortgage is also calculated based on their better income. When the income declined, the pressure on the mortgage increased as a result of floating nature of some subprime mortgage plans. Thus, the real estate problems of these American families gradually evolved into a real estate crises.
Some people cannot afford to pay their mortgages because their incomes were too low. The banks began to take over the houses from the home buyers who had defaulted on the loan, and then sold them at very low prices, resulting in a step-by-step price fall in the area. This vicious cycle caused a further decline in housing prices. When the housing prices had fallen to a certain extent, more and more home buyers found that their house values became lower than their loans. Thus, more and more people stopped repaying their home mortgages, resulting in a large number of bad debts.
In this way, a huge vicious circle formed:
“Economy downturn – incomes fall – some people can’t repay mortgages – banks sell defaulted houses at low prices – house prices fall – more people stop paying home mortgages – banks sell houses again – prices fall again ..."
The problem did not stop there. As house prices continue to fall, a new situation emerged: The money the bank got after auctioning the defaulted house was less than the loan the home buyer owed the bank, the home buyer still need to repay the loan. So stopping repayment does not necessarily mean that you are cleaned of the debt. For example, if you paid a down payment of $600,000 and borrowed $2.4 million to buy a house worth $3 million at the time. When the house price falls to $2 million, you stop to repay the loan and give the house to the bank. After the bank auctions the house, you will not only lost your down payment of $600,000, but also owed $400,000 debts to the bank. You still have to repay the debt.
Thus, with the effect of such vicious cycle one after another, the U.S. economy gradually collapsed and eventually triggered the U.S. financial crisis in 2008.
Therefore, the fact that China’s household debt ratio has reached a high level of 46.8% is a problem that requires great vigilance. Although this figure is still lower than that of developed countries at present, the signs of the problem have already begun to emerge. The central government started to stress the issue of deleveraging repeatedly in the last year, which is a very prescient judgment. If the household debt ratio is allowed to continue to climb, it will inevitably lead to a huge crisis. Therefore, we must strictly guard against the hidden financial risks.
It's no wonder that the central government has set the tone for the real estate market: Houses are for living, not for speculation. The government are taking multiple measures to resolve potential risks, including increasing land and housing supply and encouraging house renting.
For our individual families, we must abandon the mindset of speculating on real estate and make purchase according to our own financial capacities. In this way, we can prevent our families from falling under huge financial burden. A reasonable assessment of one's own income and debt levels is essential for healthy growth of family wealth.

British inventor microchips himself to get into house and car with a wave of hand
A British inventor has become the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, access his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and finger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to a medical standard.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted for cats and dogs, and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also alter locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, for a cost of £300 each lock.

White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.
The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.
"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.
Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.
A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.
But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.
So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."
It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."
Brilliant Metaphors of Xi Jinping about Comprehensively Strengthening Party Discipline
During the second plenary session of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech on January 11, emphasizing that “we should keep marching ahead on the road of adhering to the principle of comprehensively strengthening party discipline and creating a new situation for comprehensively strengthening party discipline”.
With respect to comprehensively strengthening party discipline, General Secretary Xi Jinping has given many vivid and impressive metaphors, so let’s review them together!
We should fight against “tigers” (high-ranking corrupt officials) immediately after we find evidence, and we should also deal with those “flies” (low-ranking corrupt officials) at the same time. We should spread the principle of comprehensively strengthening party discipline to grass-roots party organizations and make every effort to deal with those corruption problems in daily life of the general public.
-- On January 11, 2018, Xi Jinping gave a keynote speech during the second plenary session of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China
Officials responsible for discipline inspection and supervision at all levels should be loyal and determined, responsible, discipline and law-abiding, honest and upright in order to ensure that the power granted by the Party and the people will not be abused, and the sharp sword used for praising virtue and punishing vice will never be covered by dust.

It is understood that Chongqing currently owns 18 shale gas exploration rights established by Ministry of Land and Resources as the first domestic shale gas mining rights - the Sinopec Fuling shale gas field.
As for January 2017, a total of 368 shale gas wells (excluding parameter drill-holes) have been drilled in Chongqing, and 261 have commenced production. With recent positive news that the production volume of each of the four shale gas exploratory wells at Sinopec’s Southern Pingqiao block of the Nanchuan District has exceeded 200,000 cubic meters per day, Sinopec’s Fuling shale gas field, which is expected to have a planned capacity of 10 billion cubic meters this year, will become the first commercialized drilling of a large-scale shale gas field outside North America.
It is understood that a 10 billion cubic meter shale gas field is equivalent to a 10 million tonne oil field.
Shale gas is a clean energy resource. It is understood that the completion of the 10 billion cubic meter shale gas field will help cut 12 million tonnes of CO2 emission annually.

Afghan democracy depends on political role for women, U.N. says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.

This made Aunt Gao and her family, residents of the Machinery Office dormitory at Minzhu Road in Nanning, very happy.
Neighbors also said that flowers blooming on the money tree is a rare sight. Residents of the housing estate felt that this was very auspicious, and came to take a look out of interest after learning about the matter.
The scientific name for the money tree is “Malabar Chestnut”, a tropical plant native to Mexico. It performs best in warm and damp conditions, and its flowers will only bloom under appropriate conditions such as sunlight, water and nutriments.
Even in the wild where tropical conditions are appropriate, flowers blooming on money trees are rare. It was once said that the “chance of flowers blooming is one in a thousand”.
Yesterday morning, reporters visited the Nanning Machinery Office dormitory at Minzhu Road. Led by Aunt Gao, the reporters saw the money tree.
Planted amid the flower bed of the housing estate, the money tree was about five meters tall, and the branch circumference, at its thickest, measured approximately 30 cm. Its leaves were emerald green and luxuriant.
The flowers bloomed at tips of higher branches, and the flowers that were in full bloom were more than 10 cm wide. The delicate pale yellow filaments were evenly spread out, and the green buds, when burst, curled backwards on both sides. The fine and dense stamens resembled silver threads with gold stars at their tips.
Aunt Gao told the reporters that the money tree has been planted for eight years. When it was first planted, it was about one meter tall; it is now more than five meters tall.
It was originally a potted plant when her son first bought it from the flower and bird market, and was subsequently planted in the flower bed. She did not have to take particular care of it, but would occasionally earth it up.

Shichang Xingbao reported that between 2005 and 2011, the GDP of Anhui Province rose from joint “bottom” to second at one stroke.
However, the Province’s economic growth continued to experience difficulties such as low investment efficiency, and a lack of core competitiveness in its industrial economy. To this end, the latest issue of the “Economic Blue Paper” of the Province’s Economic Information Center advised raising the quality and benefit of economic growth.
We have made a comparison of some of the representative indices of the Province’s economy between 2005 and 2011 with that of the nation and Central China.
In 2011, in terms of industrial economic benefit, high energy consumption industries such as industrial energy and raw materials, which comprised a relatively large proportion of the Province, had to endure “twin pressures” - they were significantly affected by market volatility as well as overcapacity. At the same time, home appliances, automotive and other leading industries lacked innovation, resulting in slim profits.
Meanwhile, enormous investment did not bring about the corresponding economic benefit, which was a key factor leading to poor quality and benefit in economic growth.
As regards this, experts advised that effective measures should be adopted to incentivize enterprises to innovate. The technical outcomes of Institutions of higher learning and technological research institutes should also be promptly “transferred” to enterprises.
As for low industrial economic benefit, experts said that industry merger and reorganization should be actively advanced, industry structure optimized, and the industry chain extended.

GMB concern over investment at McVitie's Glasgow factory
A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.
It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
China News Service Tibet, May 11 wire (Chen Taobin) Nyima Tsering, Deputy Director of the Tibet Autonomous Region Sports Bureau said at the Everest North Base Camp on the 10th that the cleaning up of domestic waste on the northern slope of Mount Everest will move from a public interest action in the past toward a normalized action led by the Chinese government and in which the international community will participate.
On May 10, environmental protection volunteers loaded rubbish that have been sorted onto trucks.
China News Service/He Penglei: In the last 10 years or so, environmental protection issues at Mount Everest have become increasingly prominent as the number of Mount Everest explorers and tourists increased significantly.
In the Spring of 1997, the Tibet Autonomous Region Mountaineering Association initiated the first clean-up on the Northern slope of Mount Everest, cleaning up oxygen tanks and other domestic waste left over from the 1960s and 1970s. This video was also specially broadcast at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto that year, drawing world attention.
According to Nyima Tsering, after 1997, public interest groups arrived successively to help clean up the Northern slope of Mount Everest, but most of the participants were non-professionals.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.
Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll face consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.

According to the UK media, Admiral William Moran, the deputy director of Naval Operations, said that even though the US Navy was reinvigorating to cope with the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States would continue to take the Asia-Pacific region as the focus of its navy -- the Pentagon had expanded the scope of Asia-Pacific region to include the Indian Ocean - Asia - the Pacific.
According to the reports from the site of "Jane's Defence Weekly" on September 24, China and Russia were classified as the strategic competitors in the new national defense strategy, which was announced by the United States at the beginning of the year.
Then, the US Navy recommissioned the Second Fleet to stand up against the Russian activities more directly.
It was reported that these actions raised some doubts and concerns among its allies and analysts. They were afraid that the US Navy might go far away from the strategy of "Rebalancing toward Asia-Pacific", which marked the Obama administration.
However, Admiral William Moran said that the focus of the US Navy would still focus on the West Pacific.
At the round-table discussion, which was hosted by National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington on January 24, 2018, he said: "For us, there are any significant changes. "
Moran said: "The focus remains on rebalancing, shifting focus or whatever you want to describe it. "
But he admitted that the United States kept close relations with Europe.
He said: "We would continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast. "
Although he pointed out that the overall policy about Russia fell within the terms of reference of the United States Secretary of Defense, he warned: "The Russians might face the demographic and economic challenges, but the history demonstrates that they will become very tough if we have a conflict with them. "
Admiral Moran said that as a part of the comeback action to fight against Russia, China and other competitors, the US Navy was dynamically deploying the troops into a "new campaign mode". This would help to make the opponents unaware unprepared for the deployments of the American aircraft carrier battle group or other assets at any specified time and place.
He said: "Our Navy and Marine Corps support it -- the concept of unpredictable battle. We should not show up at the same place again and again like clockwork. -- This is our approach. "
It was reported that the first to try this new approach was the "Harry Truman" aircraft carrier battle group, and its early deployment included the working visits to ports and the patrols in areas, where it usually only passed.
Moran said that the US Navy was currently trying to ensure its allies to know that these warships would still patrol in the traditional areas, and solving the logistical problems and family liaison problems for new deployment process.
Vice Admiral Michael Noonan, the Commander of Royal Australian Navy, also delivered a speech in this event to indicate that the Australian army could seamlessly cooperate with the American aircraft carrier battle group.
He said that this situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy had planned to purchase another 9 frigates with the "Aegis" combat system.

Itochu recognized $1.3 billion impairment losses to the investment on CITIC Limited on Friday. Write-downs of this largest enterprise investment was made due to influences of tense China-US trade.
In May 2016, a man passed by the headquarter of Marubeni Corporation in Tokyo, Japan.
Marubeni said that the trade war struck Gavilon, the subordinate American cereal department, which has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Previously, some Japanese manufacturers of heavy equipment and telecommunications companies have warned about the impact of China-US trade frictions when announcing their latest performance, and now these Japanese traders have joined the ranks.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on each other's goods with the price of hundreds of billions of dollars. President Trump threatened to expand the scope of the tariff to more than $500 billion of goods imported from China if the dispute could not be resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, the Chief Financial Officer of Itochu, said that the trade dispute might have greater impact on Chinese economy next year.
Itochu and Charoen Pokphand Group invested $10 billion to CITIC in 2015, gaining 20% stock equity.
Hachimura said that Itochu proposed 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) losses to this part of share holdings since it considered the share price of CITIC not to rise again.
Itochu maintains its profit prediction of 500 billion yen of the financial year ended 31 March, 2019.
China imposed a 25% import tariff on the soybeans imported from America in July, to counter the initiatives of Washington on trade frictions.
"Our cereal business has been struck by China-US trade frictions," the Chief Financial Officer of Itochu Nobuhiro Yabe said.
He said that Gavilon has terminated the financial transaction of its account since September.
Pat Burke, the spokesman of Gavilon, pointed out in the statement on Friday that the action of this company was "in the light of internal policy limits and due to lack of market opportunities. "

Report on November 5 of China News A round-up report: the U.S. midterm election starts counting down.
On November 4, President Trump and his democratic opponents actively "drum up votes" on their core voters.
Both Parties indicated that voter turnout will be a key factor to influence the situation of election.
According to the report, in 48 hours before the Americans went to vote, Trump was busy attending the rally for the Republican candidate, while the former President Obama just arrived in Indiana to rally for Joe Donnelly, the Democratic candidate of the Federal Senate, who asked for emergency help for the situation of election, and to shout out his final pre-election appeal.
On November 4, Trump went to Maycomb, Georgia to rally for Brian Kemp, the state governor of Republicans. He said, "you must go to the polls and cast a vote. "
"The contrast in this election cannot be clearer. "
Voters’ political enthusiasm has boosted to a rare peak and early voting of some states has been far more than usual.
When successive American presidents face their first midterm elections, their parties tend to have fewer members of congress.
According to the new poll released by the "Washington Post" and the ABC News on Day 4, although the Democratic situation of election for the House of Representatives maintains an advantage, the Republicans could benefit from an economic assessment and Trump's strict focus on border security.
The poll indicates that more registered voters like the Democratic candidate of the House of Representatives than the Republican candidate with proportion of 50% versus 43%. However, it still falls down compared with leading of 14 percentage points in August.
According to the other poll made by NBC and the Wall Street Journal, the Democrats still take 7 percentage points ahead of the Republicans.
It is reported that Obama told the crowds at a rally for Senator Donnelly, "When people don't tell the truth, and words don't mean anything anymore, that's going to have evil consequences.
Democracy does not work when people can only desperately tell lies. "
"Now, the only way to stop the behaviors of these Republicans is you and your vote. "
The Democrats face the toughest situation of election in the Senate for decades, and now the Republicans hold more than half (51) of seats.
However, the situation of election in the House of Representatives is relatively advantageous, and the Democrats need to win 23 seats to take control of 435 seats of the House of Representatives.
According to the assessment of analysts from FiveThirtyEight.com, a website for predicting the situation of election, the possibility that the Democrats win the House of Representatives can reach up to 85%.

People’s Daily Online, Beijing, November 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) - In the current tide of "mass entrepreneurship and innovation", more and more technology companies have begun to pay attention to patent R&D and related protection work, and deeply explore the potential value of patents to occupy the market domination.
Similarly, many technology companies have encountered numerous infringements crisis in patent technology licensing and patent technology use.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province, on the grounds of patent infringement, appealed the developer of "Didi Chuxing" APP, Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiaoju Technology), the operator, Didi Chuxing Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Chuxing), the seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately stopped the actions of manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, and using the plaintiff’s patent.
On October 30, 2018, China Judgment Online published the "First-instance Civil Ruling Paper of Infringement of Invention Patent Rights between Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.", which disclosed some details of case in which the Didi Chuxing APP was sued for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs believe that they are the patentees and inventors of the "carpooling service system and method based on mobile terminals", and the whole operation process of the "ride-sharing" application in the "Didi Chuxing" APP corresponds to the technical solution of the patent protection involved in the case, which formed a patent infringement.
However, during the court’s ruling, Xiaoju Technology believed that Guangdong Pacific was not an eligible defendant. It only provided free downloads of the involved APP "Didi Chuxing" on the Internet, and did not implement the patent method involved. There was no direct or indirect infringement behavior, and it should not be included as a defendant in this case.
Secondly, the infringement of this case was not in Guangdong.
According to the law, the infringement of the patent involved should be the place where the patent method involved in the case was completely implemented. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the court was challenged and the case was requested to be transferred to the court of the defendant's domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the alleged infringement Didi Chuxing APP product on its online platform. It is not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
And the defendant Guangdong Pacific’s domicile is located in Guangzhou, under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant Xiaoju Technology advocated that the case be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial with inadequate evidence. The Court dismissed the defendant Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.’s objection to the jurisdiction of the case, and ordered it assume the acceptance fee for the case.
At present, the other trials of the case have not been announced, and the reporter will pay close attention to the follow-up details of the patent infringement case of Didi Chuxing.
Exclusive Interview with CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization: Australia-China Science and Technology Cooperation Achieved Remarkable Results
"China’s science and technology have developed rapidly in the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve fruitful results by going forward hand in hand in the scientific field. "
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization said in an exclusive interview with a reporter from the China News Service in Beijing, the cooperation between Australia and China in the field of science and technology has shown great vitality from the cooperation in dealing with climate change to the "Eye of Heaven" project.
As the largest national research institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many world famous innovative research results in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"This is a lasting friendship that involves the trust of partners and the tradition of long-term cooperation. ", Marshall said.
In May of this year, China’s Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope ― China’s Eye of Heaven, installed the world’s first 19-beam L-band receiver.
This internationally most advanced 19-beam feed source receiver is jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on CSIRO’s many years of technical accumulation. When enabled, the FAST survey speed will increase by 5 to 6 times, meanwhile more scientific observation targets will be expanded.
"This is the contribution of CSIRO to FAST. "
In addition to the above cooperations, CSIRO is also working closely with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of Square Kilometer Array radio telescope, research and development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.
"In the past, scientific researches often focused on problems after hundreds of years, and now more scientific research power is needed to solve the problems in front of them. "
Marshall believed that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and both countries face a series of challenges in their development progress.
For example, extreme weather occurs frequently in the world. Drought and floods have led to a reduction in food production and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, population explosion, aging, chronic disease and other problems are also the serious challenges we faced.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused on solving these current problems. "
Marshall said that the key job of Center for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research, jointly established by CSIRO and National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), are observing El Nino phenomenon and La Nina phenomenon, studying the relationships between these two phenomenons and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather. The new species of cereals developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences can overcome extreme weather and can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, technological innovation is difficult to accomplish by oneself, it requires extremely high costs, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today. "
Marshall expressed that the closer the cooperation is, the more likely it is to make breakthroughs. This is also the significance of Australia and China in strengthening cooperation under the framework of the "One Belt One Road".
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly for cooperation in science and technology for us. "
Marshall took the example that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method without using cyanide. Because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a way to purify gold with little environmental pollution.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology to China. This is one of the achievements of our participation in the "One Belt One Road" cooperation. "

Ri Yong Ho, the foreign minister North Korea, told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening the distrust of the United States on North Korea and it was impossible for North Korea to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said on the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had taken "very kind actions" during the last year, including cessation of missile and nuclear tests, dismantling of nuclear test sites and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies
"However, we haven’t seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"If the United States doesn’t trust on us, we have no confidence in our national security. It is impossible for us to unilaterally abandon the nuclear weapons under such circumstances. "
Although Ri Yong Ho repeated the complaints of North Korea about the opposition of United States to "phased" denuclearization, his speech was of great significance because it did not completely refuse the unilateral denuclearization as North Korea had before.
Ri Yong Ho mentioned the joint statement between Jeong-eun Kim and Trump on June 12, and at that time Jeong-eun Kim agreed to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to protect the security of North Korea.
North Korea has always been seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that North Korea must firstly abandon nuclear weapons.
The United States also refused to loose the requirements for the international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goals in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue the ‘declaration of the end of the war’," Ri Yong Ho said.
"The thought that sanctions can make us kneel and beg forgiveness is the daydream of the people who don't know us.
However, the problem is that such continued sanctions are deepening our distrust. "
Ri Yong Ho did not mention the second Trump-Kim summit plan mentioned by the US President earlier this week at the United Nations.
On the contrary, he emphasized the three meetings between Jeong-eun Kim and Moon Jae-in, the South Korean President over the past five months and said, "If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea, but not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so deadlocked. "
China announced that it will reduce import tariffs on 1,585 tax items from November 1, 2018.
Since this year, China has taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1 this year, the drug was fully tax-deducted, and all import tariffs for all 28 tax items of general taxable drugs, including anticancer drugs, and alkaloid drugs with anticancer effects, and Chinese patent medicines with actual imports, were adjusted to zero.
At the same time, it has also greatly reduced the production and import links value-added tax burden of anti-cancer drugs.
On July 1, tax reductions were imposed on 218 tax items of cars and parts.
After the tax reduction, the finished automobile tax rate of China’s automobile has been lower than the average level of developing countries, which is in line with the actual situation of China’s automobile industry.
This tax reduction will drive the restructuring of the industry and the optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the survival of the fittest to help improve the quality of products and services. It is expected to promote the adjustment of automobile prices to a certain extent, so that consumers can get more benefits.
On July 1, tax reductions were imposed on 1449 tax items of daily consumer goods.
The tax reduction on daily consumer goods is closely bound up with people’s need of better lives.
This time’s tax reduction not only involves lots of items but also has strong dynamics, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
The reduction of taxes on daily consumer goods directly benefits the consumers and promotes the competitiveness of domestic industries.
November 1, tax reductions will be imposed on 1585 industrial product tax items of electromechanical devices, parts and raw materials.
Appropriately reducing the import tariffs of some domestically industrial products with urgent needs can attract more foreign capital, help increase domestic effective supply, assist industrial upgrading, and contribute to enterprises allocate resources on a global scale, reduce production costs, and also benefit for reducing the pressure on the domestic environment.
Relevant person in charge of Customs Tariff Commissions Office of the State Council introduced that the above four times initiative tax reduction and the third step tax reduction implemented on this year’s July 1 in accordance with the results of the expansion of the information technology agreement negotiation will result in the overall tariff level fell from last year’s 9.8% to 7.5%.
The adjusted overall tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than most developing countries, at a moderately low level, and basically matches China’s developing country status and development stage.
According to the person in charge, as one of the important indicators of the degree of openness in China’s trade in goods sector, the overall level of tariffs should be compatible with the stage of China’s economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China’s trade in goods scale ranks first in the world, and it has already had the economic foundation to further expand its openness. However, there is still a gap between the quality and efficiency of trade development compared with developed economies. Therefore, the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately lowered.
Tariff is a kind of protect means for compliance. The level of tariff should be compatible with industrial competitiveness to encourage healthy competition. While overprotection goes against the industry development and quality improvement.
Tariff rate adjustment must balance production needs with consumer demands.
Focus on reducing the commodity tax rate that has a large domestic demand and contributes to the transformation and upgrading of the industry, and striving to increase the import of characteristic advantage products with relatively concentrated needs of the people, continuously improving the sense of gain of enterprises and the public, and meeting the upgrading needs of the industrial structure and consumption structure.
The tax reduction should balance the financial revenue and the affordability of industrial development.
In the choice of specific tax-reduction commodities and range of tax reductions, we must plan and coordinate the domestic and international markets, the upstream and downstream aspects, production and consumption relationship, and maintain the steady development of China’s economy.
The principal stressed that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. China’s initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure based on China’s own needs to achieve high-quality development. It is conducive to the overall planning and utilization of international and foreign resources to promote the quality of domestic supply systems and meet the upgrading consumption needs of people.
This action and measure shows tfhat China will constantly pursue an opening up strategy of mutual benefit and win-win result, firmly support economic globalization, steadfastly uphold the principle of free trade rule and the multilateral trading system centered on the WTO, and continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the world to also allow China’s development to better benefit the world.
Serbia announced to enter the top defense readiness condition. Serbian President and Russian President will meet to discuss the situation in Kosovo tomorrow.
Yugoslav news agency reported by quoting sources from the Office of Serbian President that Vucic, the Serbian President, gave orders that the Serbian armed forces entered the top defense readiness condition in consideration of the fact that Kosovo special troops had occupied the roadway to the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower station under the control of Belgrade in northern Kosovo.
On September 29, Vulin, the Defense Minister of Serbia, announced that the Serbian army entered the overall defense readiness condition.
Vulin emphasized that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as Vucic's orders were still effective. Regardless of the direction in which the situation develops, the Serbian army will respond accordingly.
It was reported by the Tass news agency of Russia that Vucic said in an interview on September 29 that he had notified the United States, Russia, Europe and other sides about the current situation, and would visit Moscow on October 2 to meet with Putin, the President of Russia, to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When he was asked whether Serbia needed to get the military support from Russia like Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: "I don't want a significant military conflict in our territory. "
Vucic also said that the Serbian army entered the overall defense readiness condition just for the sake of deterrence to prevent the conflict. However, it was a clear warning: Serbia would never tolerate any violent action in Kosovo.
The Serbian army upgraded the defense readiness condition in connection with the two actions in Kosovo.
According to the statement of Serbia, the Albanian people were carrying out the mass arrests of Serbian people, who had been living there for generations, in recent days, but these arrested Serbian people didn't break any laws.
Vucic said that since Marko Juric, the head of the Serbian government's Office for Kosovo and Metohija, was beaten and detained by the Albanian army in Kosovo, the Albanian people constantly escalated the issues in the region and carried out the inhumane arrests and deportations of the Serbian people.
Furthermore, over 100 people, including the members of ROSU special army of the Department of the Interior of the self-declared Republic of Kosovo, armed police, and snipers, occupied the battle field near the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower station, entered the ecological sport center near the dam in northern Kosovo, and blocked all roads nearby. These areas were originally under the control of Serbia.
Vucic indicated that Kosovo was encouraged by the western countries to make this military adventure. Since the Kosovo army had taken actions without notifying Serbia in advance, it violated the rules in Paragraph 1 in Chapter 9 of "Brussels Agreement", and it also breached the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military technology agreement between Serbia and Kosovo.
Vucic had spoken to Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary-General, to criticize the western countries for their false words on the Kosovo issue.
The source of current conflict was still the historical grievances lasting for hundreds of years between Serbian people and Albanian people in Kosovo.
For the ownership of Kosovo, Serbian people and Albanian people had different opinions.
Serbia considered Kosovo as the birthplace of its nation and the cradle of culture, because Serbia had built its most powerful country here in the 12th century. However, the Albanian people settled here in large numbers only after the Ottoman Empire invaded and the Serbian army retreated to the north.
The Albanian people insisted that the Illyrian people of the primitive tribe located at Kosovo in the 4th-5th century were their ancestors. Therefore, Kosovo had been the Albanian people's territory since ancient times.
The subjective political divisions contributed to the sharp conflicts between different nations, religions and cultures, resulting in the fierce confrontation between Serbian people and Albanian people in Kosovo.
The Albanian people in Kosovo first declared the independence of Albania in 1912.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanian people, who were living in the Balkan Peninsula, moved to Turkey. The proportion of Serbian people was relatively rising. The actions of "taking back their own lands" in the sight of the Serbian people were considered as the predations of the "Greater Serbian Nationalism" by Albanian people. The contradiction between the two nations intensified.
Kosovo became the "powder keg" of Balkan.
The Albanian separatists in Kosovo liberation army and the Serbian army and police engaged in armed conflicts in 1999, which led to the NATO troops bombed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia consisting of Serbia and Montenegro. The Kosovo War broke out.
Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008.
Thereafter, the news came out that Serbia and Kosovo would normalize relations, and sign a global and legally binding agreement. However, due to the historical grievances between the two nations and the geopolitical constraints, they failed to sign the agreement, which was in the control of different forces, including the United States, Europe and Russia.
Just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he insisted to separate Serbian people from Albanian people in Kosovo. It exposed the conflict between the two nations again.
Power Communication Still in interruption. Difficulties in Rescue due to Strong Earthquakes with Tsunami in Indonesia.
According to figures released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency on the morning of the 30th, a devastating earthquake and the caused tsunami in the Donggala Regency in Central Sulawesi caused 420 people on 28th.
Wilem Rampangilei, head of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said that the figure is only preliminary statistics from the Palu in Central Sulawesi, about 80 kilometers from the epicenter. Because of the lack of large-scale search and rescue machinery, many damaged and collapsed hotels, shopping malls, warehouses and other densely populated buildings due to the earthquake have not been searched and rescued.
On September 29, 2018, in Palu, Indonesia, a bridge damaged by the earthquake and tsunami collapsed into several sections.
Due to the severe damage to power and communication facilities, the epicenter of Donggala Regency and the neighboring Sigi area are still “lonely islands" that cannot be reached, and the number of victims cannot be counted.
According to media reports here, Indonesian Vice President Kalla said the death toll may reach thousands.
Power interruption, communication interruption, road blockage, airport damage... The rescue work after strong earthquakes and tsunami is very difficult.
Due to power interruption, some hospitals and rescue settlements in Palu rely on fuel for power generation.
The roads entering and leaving the city are blocked due to landslides, and large transport vehicles, including tank trucks, are unable to enter, which makes the fuel supply very tight.
Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs, Agus said that due to road damage, the Ministry dispatched emergency relief materials such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food and household goods packages from Central Sulawesi and Gorontalo adjacent to the earthquake region have not arrived in the disaster area.
The disaster relief materials transported from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster area through the air transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to thecontrol tower and runways of the Palu Airport during the earthquake, all commercial flights have been grounded to ensure the safety and security of the rescue. The airport is only used for the take-off and landing of military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel.
Wiranto, the Indonesian Coordinating Ministry for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, who directed the rescue in the earthquake zone, demanded that the power supply and airport commercial flights be restored as soon as possible to ensure the operating of hospitals and other relief agencies, so that more rescuers, volunteers and aids can be transported to disaster areas.
On the 28th, several strong earthquakes occurred in Donggala Regency in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia continuously. The 7.7-magnitude earthquake that occurred at 17:02 local time caused a tsunami, which caused Palu City, Donggala Regency and Sigi area occurred major disasters.

The photography competition with the theme of the "bluest sky" voluntarily organized by the residents on social platforms was still under way.
Why was the sky so blue in Beijing recently?
As the relevant responsible person of Beijing Environmental Protection Agency explained, the mean concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was 35 micrograms per cubic meter in Beijing in August of this year, which created the best record for the same period in history of the recent five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 was even less than 10 in September.
The major factor contributing to the "bluest sky" was the overall favorable meteorological conditions in recent days. And more importantly, Beijing had persistently carried out the air pollution control. It had vigorously promoted the Clean Air Action Plan in the past five years, and the environmental benefits were released continuously resulting in the reduction of total pollutant emission in the region. These laid the foundation for continuous improvement of air quality.
Beijing released officially and implemented the "2013-2017 Clean Air Action Plan in Beijing" in 2013.
According to this plan, the authority would continue to guide the alleviation of functions unrelated to its status as national capital, and promoted the works of clean energy substitutions and pollutants discharge reductions. 4923 coal fired boilers were eliminated in total.
Thus, Beijing became the first big city of achieving the full network of natural gasification in the Chinese mainland.
According to the data, the annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing from 2013 to 2017 cumulatively dropped by 35.6%; the number of days that the air quality reached the standards increased by 50; the number of days that achieved the Superior First Grade increased by 25; the number of days with heavy pollution reduced by 35 in total, and the occurrence rate of heavy pollution significantly dropped.
With the continuous improvement of air quality, Beijing authority issued the "Three-year Action Plan of Beijing to Win the Blue Sky Protection Campaign" in September on the basis of the analysis of a new round of PM2.5 source. According to the current governance phase and pollution characteristics, it focused on the important prevention and control areas including the treatment of diesel trucks, flying dusts, and volatile organic compounds, optimized and adjusted the transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land-use structure, strengthened the inter-regional prevention and control, enhanced the delicacy management of city, promoted the green development in an all-round way, and strived to keep the "bluest sky" permanently in Beijing. The sky would not "be precious", since it was rare. Let it return to be the background of people's photo album, but not the leading role.
During this year’s National Day Golden Week, the Municipal Tourism Commission, Industry and Commerce Bureau, City Urban Administrative and Law Enforcement Bureau, Public Security Bureau and other relevant departments will strengthen the law enforcement inspection of the "one-day tour" market, focusing on the "six unlicensed" chaos in tourism, and once verified, the violations will be imposed on strict and serious punishment according to the law.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a thematic meeting on illegal "one-day tour" to deploy a special action to further crack down on illegal "one-day tour".
At the meeting, the focus was on the "six unlicensed" chaos that was intertwined with the unlicensed ticket provider, unlicensed tour guide, unlicensed travel agency, unlicensed car, tourist trap and unlicensed website profit chain. The city launched a special action for "one-day tour" on July 28th.
Since the launch of the special action, the city has accepted 39 "one-day tour" complaints with a year on year decrease of 63%. Since the beginning of this year, the city has accepted 270 "one-day tour" complaints with a year on year decrease of 62%.
In the past two months, the city has checked and detained 248 "unlicensed cars", investigated and handled 158 violations of the tourist transportation business, shut down 29 shopping "tourist traps" and performing arts venues, investigated and handled 13 "unlicensed travel agencies" and 27 "unlicensed tour guides", confiscated 26,000 pieces of illegal advertisements, torn down 31 pieces of illegal "one-day tour" billboards and 3 pieces of fake bus stop signs, investigated and handled 1789 various types of travel-related violations, and 181 cases were filed by various functional departments with a heavier fine of 4.48 million yuan and 111 travel-related illegal criminals were detained.
After rectification, the illegal "one-day tour" chaos has been basically contained, and the "one-day tour" market order has shown a steady and good trend.
According to the information, the city has continuously strengthen the force of illegal "one-day tour rectification in recent years.
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission accepted 1,612 complaints and 897 complaints of "one-day tour", a year-on-year decrease of 79% and 44% respectively. Though the crack down actions are contentiously implemented, the illegal "one-day tours" are still recurrent, forming the intertwined profit chains among the "six unlicensed" chaos of unlicensed ticket provider, unlicensed tour guide, unlicensed travel agency, unlicensed car, tourist trap and unlicensed website.
Specifically, "unlicensed ticket provider" is the person who attract customers on the street illegally, "unlicensed website" is the illegal website providing fake tourism information, "unlicensed travel agency" engaged in illegal "one-day tour" or an institution without business qualification of travel agencies, "unlicensed tour guide" is the tour guide without tourist certificate or practice illegally and employed by the "unlicensed travel agency", "unlicensed car" is the vehicle without tourist transportation qualification used by "unlicensed tour guide" or the vehicle with tourist transportation qualification used for providing passenger service to illegal "one-day tour", and last, the "unlicensed tour guide" will bring the tourists to the specified travel shopping store, that is "tourist trap".
In this special action, the city continued to increase the fixed inspection and flexible inspection of illegal "one-day tour". Focus on the illegal "one-day tour" with high frequency and influential tourist route points, the relevant departments assigned daily secret investigation teams to make investigations with the tour groups secretly, and strict investigation and treatment will be imposed according to the law, if violations are found.
Among them, "unlicensed car" and "tourist trap" have become the two focuses of the serious crack downs in the special action.
According to reports, without "unlicensed cars", the illegal "one-day tour" can not be completed, "unlicensed cars" are easy to be found, remembered and investigated, they are also fixed value with a hinger single value.
Relevant departments used road traffic surveillance cameras to increase the supervision of the tourist buses along the key "one-day tour" routes, and use intelligence measures such as technology prevention and physical prevention to find and investigate "unlicensed cars" in time.
"Tourist trap" during traveling has become a key focus due to its small number and operation in locality.
In order to strengthen the shock and attack on illegal "one-day tour", all the functional departments will impose heavy and strict punishments according to law, once they have verified the violation of laws and regulations.
In August of this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to illegal "one-day tour", and discussed means and methods combining administrative punishment with conviction of imprisonment.
The Municipal Tourism Commission said that in the future, more formal travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out Beijing "one-day tour" and increase the supply of formal "one-day tour" to further occupy the living space of illegal "one-day tour". The specific plan is still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has continuously improved the electronic travel itinerary information system of the tour group to ensure that each group is included in the electronic itinerary platform supervision.
From a tourist symbol to a symbol of digital economy, what has Wuzhen experienced in these years

After aggressive treatment, the survival rate of premature infants of 29 weeks and more gestation is 98% in China, which has reached the level of developed countries.
ECNS, Shanghai, September 30 (reported by Chen Jing and Luo Yanqian) -- Children's National Medical Center and Children's Hospital of Fudan University disclosed on September 30 that it had introduced the Canadian advanced method in the leading "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China".
The project result showed that after aggressive treatment, the survival rate of premature infants of 29 weeks and more gestation was 98% in China, which had reached the level of developed countries. However, the survival rate of premature infants of minimum gestation and the survival rate of premature infants without complications still needed to be improved greatly.
During the past 20 years, the Chinese government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborns.
Currently, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71‰, which is significantly lower than the national average level and has reached the advanced level of developed countries.
The "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China" has significantly improved the survival quality of premature infants through four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, the director of NICU of Children's Hospital of Fudan University told the reporter that it was of great significance for the improvement of premature infants' overall survival quality and population quality to pay attention to the reduction of premature infants' survival quality, reduce the complication rates, improve the neurodevelopmental prognosis, and improve the overall outcome of baby patients while improving the survival rate of premature infants. It was an important problem of concern to the pediatric and neonatal departments at home and abroad, and it was also a critical issue in this project.
The "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China" has included tens of thousands of cases of premature infants of 33 weeks and less gestation in China and has contributed to 1/3 reduction of the mortality rate of premature infants of minimum gestation and small birth weight through four years of unremitting efforts. At the same time, the severe complication rate of premature infants has been significantly reduced and the survival quality of premature infants has been greatly improved.
This project has established a set of complete, systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement methods, which are suitable for our domestic conditions and will collaboratively improve the prognosis of premature infants and improve the level of neonatal care by setting up the national collaboration network of national quality improvement, introducing the concepts of collaborative quality improvement, and combing 25 cooperative hospitals in China.
Children's Hospital of Fudan University is connecting the forces of neonatal departments across the country, and developing the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the experience accumulated in the project in order to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections.
It is reported that in the "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China", the pediatric hospitals has introduced the EPIQ methods into 25 large NICU in 19 provinces in order to solve the disturbing problem of neonatal infections in China NICU.
After more than 10 years of constant improvement, the survival rate of premature infants without complications in Canada has increased by about 1/3. Canada is now one of the countries with the best prognosis in premature infants in the world.
The EPIQ methods have been widely applied to all NICUs in Canada, and have been adopted by 6 other countries.
According to the pediatric hospital, the research results show that after implementing the EPIQ intervention for two years, the infection rate of premature infants will drop by 35%, and the usage rate of antibiotics will drop by 20%.
In the future, Children's Hospital of Fudan University will continue to promote and implement these methods in the whole country, aiming at comprehensively reducing the occurrence rates of all complications in premature infants and improving the quality of treatment for newborns in China.
At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are differences and inequalities in the level of treatment in various regions in China.
According to Professor Cao Yun's introduction, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role as an important construction unit of Children's National Medical Center. This project covers Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and many other western provinces, with the goal of gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal treatment throughout the country.
It is reported that Children's Hospital of Fudan University is connecting the forces of neonatal departments across the country, and developing the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the experience accumulated in the project in order to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections.
It has been revealed that the coordination center's Chinese Neonatal Network located at Children's Hospital of Fudan University will unite 63 hospitals across China to carry out the next stage of national quality improvement in 2019, with the goal of promoting the homogenization of neonatal treatment in China.
Wu Jinglei, the director of Shanghai Health and Family Planning Commission, says that Shanghai can become a central city in Asia center. Its research, construction of the entire service system, service quality and service outcomes should have a place in Asia, in order to truly reflect China's medical level.
Xin Shiping: Build the "monument of heroes" in the heart - written on the fifth Memorial Day.
On September 30, on the eve of the 69th birthday of the People's Republic of China, we ushered in the fifth Memorial Day. Xi Jinping and other Party and state leaders came to the Tian'anmen Square to attend the ceremony for presenting flower baskets to the people's heroes.
At this moment, please pay tribute to the heroes wherever you are.
The Memorial Day is not only for reviving, but also for awakening.
Look back the rich history, every martyr’s name represents a fresh life.
They also have fiery youth, sincere love and caring families.
However, for the belief that "the doctrine we believe in is the truth of the universe", and for the purpose to "spare the suffering of the next generation", they are willing to sacrifice everything.
"I would cry for China in each day of my life".
Through time and space, the heroes set up spiritual signposts to guide the way forward.
"Where do you come from and where do you go?"; "What kind of man you want to be?"; It's not hard to have the answers if you understand the heroes.
In memory of heroes, the most important thing is to build a "monument of heroes" in the heart.
According to the incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary wartime, around 20 million martyrs have died heroically for national independence, liberation of the people and prosperity of the country.
Due to various reasons, many martyrs don’t even leave their names.
Countless heroes and martyrs enrich ideals with blood, practice faith with life. To remember their names and inherit their spirit, is to protect the nation's root and soul.
This "monument of heroes" cannot be stained or damaged.
For some time, the historical nihilism, abused entertainment and other undercurrents emerge.
All sorts of actions that distort and disparage heroes and martyrs, challenge just conscience, derange value judgments, and cause the public indignation and vigilance of the whole society.
Heroes and martyrs cannot be desecrated, and heroes cannot be forgotten.
We cannot let actions that touch the bottom line drift. We must dare to show our sword and uphold the dignity of heroes with rule of law and justice.
On May 1, the law for the protection of heroes and martyrs came into force.
From the perspective of judicial practice, the verdict of some cases is to the satisfaction of the masses, which not only effectively maintains the glorious image of heroes in accordance with the law, but also releases the positive energy for respecting heroes and martyrs.
A nation with pursuits cannot live without heroes, and a country with ideals cannot live without pioneers.
It has become a common social consensus to recall the martyrs and call for heroes.
Currently, there are millions of memorial facilities of various kinds in China, and more than 100 million people visit the martyrs' cemetery every year.
The hearts of the people are the strongest footstones.
Let advocating heroes, defending heroes, learning from heroes and caring heroes prevail, and let the spirit of heroes merge into the national blood. The "monument of heroes" will stand firmly between sky and earth and deep in the hearts of the people.
Report of Reuters on September 28 in Brussels: The European Union took a non-confrontational stance against Italy on Friday after Italy looked down upon EU demands and surprised the market with a massive budget deficit plan. But if Italy stuck to a too bold goal, the EU might take a more radical stance.
The aim of Italian Eurosceptic government was that the budget deficit was equivalent to 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the next three years, suggesting that there was no debt reduction despite deficit reduction requirements.
Moscovici, the executive committee member of economic affairs of the European Commission, said on Friday, "We are not interested in the crisis between the European Commission and Italy," he responded cautiously since the proposals and sanctions of the European Commission might have little impact on Italy.
The officials and diplomats of the European Commission still hoped that market forces would persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy officially submitted it to the European Commission in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, while the Italian bond yields hit their highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit goal remained unchanged before the deadline in October, the European Commission might veto the Italian draft budget, which has never been done to any country by the European Commission.
Dombrowski, the Vice-President of the European Commission said at a meeting in Riga, the capital of Latvia later on Friday that current Italian fiscal plan "seems to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Convention", which was referred to the EU fiscal provisions.
However, he did not mention how this would trigger a response of the EU.
Bidders may submit their applications for participation in this open tender before October 26 this year.

Faced with the familiar teammates in the past, Zhu Ting, who played for the VakıfBank Sports Club, received a lot of restrictions in the first game of the day. Then she took the initiative to make changes and still played a strong offense.
"My opponents and I are very familiar with each other. It is normal to be marked by the opponent, but the Chinese team is playing to the extreme, and the block and the offense are playing well in the case of a bad first pass. "
Next, the Chinese women’s volleyball team will take a day off for physical and technical training; on October 2nd, they will face the third team in the group match, Canada.

The reporter learned at the observation meeting that the film-free cotton technology system with "Chinese Cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body has initially achieved the goal of film-free planting in cotton fields, reducing the pollution of the Xinjiang cotton field film residue to the ecological environment and raw cotton. And film-free cotton integrated technology’s research and demonstration have achieved significant progresses.
Academician Yu Shuxun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, famous cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the national modern agricultural industrial technology system’s cotton system, introduced the growth of film-free cotton for Zhou Guomo, secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang A&F University.
"The comprehensive technology of the film-free cotton developed by us can completely realize the cotton planting without the film, and can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and realize green cotton planting. "
Yu Shuxun described, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Xinjiang is China’s most important cotton-producing region. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the cotton planting area in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the national cotton area.
Since the introduction of mulching film in China in 1982, the filmed area of various types of crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million mu, and the annual use of mulching film is about 30 million tons.
Among them, cotton mulching film coverage rate reached 100%, and cotton field mulching film accounted for about 60% of Xinjiang film use.
Use film-free cotton for production measurement, and the cotton output can be fully realized from 320 kg to 350 kg per mu.
With the increasing amount of mulching film input in Xinjiang, the residual film recovery rate is low, the residual film volume in the soil is gradually increased, and the soil structure damages and other problems caused by residual film seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great influence on the quality of cotton fiber.
Currently, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, Xinjiang mechanized harvesting area is about 14 million mu.
In the process of cotton mechanized harvesting, a large amount of broken film on earth surface and the cotton plant are picked up. The broken film doped in the raw cotton is difficult to remove during the processing of raw cotton, and can not be completely removed in the subsequent textile processing process, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On September 28, the nationwide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Xayar County, Xinjiang.
In order to solve the cotton mulching film pollution, simplify the cotton planting technology and improve the cotton field efficiency, Yu Shuxun led his team to use 8 years to implement the "Chinese Cotton 619" film-free cotton technology planting, adding "advantages" to Xinjiang’s agricultural green development.
Yu Shuxun introduced, with the new idea of innovative breeding, they cultivate a new line of extra early ripening, saline-alkaline tolerance, low temperature resistant, and high yield upland cotton "Chinese Cotton 619".
" ‘Chinese Cotton 619’ has achieved a series of supporting measures such as film-free seeding machinery, improved seeding depth, shallow buried in drip irrigation zone, suitable seeding density screening, and reasonable chemical regulation under the condition of film-free cultivation in southern Xinjiang. "
At present, Aksu, Korla, Alear and other places have established a demonstration base for film-free cotton, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Film-free cotton planting has achieved high yield, cost savings, environmental protection and improved overall benefits.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at the Third Division of the Agricultural Science Research Institute of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through nearly six years of research and demonstration of film-free cotton cultivation techniques, the production of film-free cottonseed cotton can fully achieve 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, and may even be higher.
"The promotion of film-free cotton cultivation technology has great prospects. "
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, the film-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is still a certain gap between the current economic benefits and the cultivation of mulching film.
"The support of cotton purchasing price will be conducive to future promotion. "
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and large-scale promotion and application of the film-free cotton, making the industry of film-free cotton larger and stronger, and completely solving the problem of soil pollution caused by the film.

Wang Yi, the Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister made a speech at the Council of Foreign Relations on Friday, and said that currently, the China-U.S. relation came to a crossroad again. If both sides can actively treat each other with tolerance, expand and deepen the positive cooperation, and properly control differences and contradictions, they can open up a better prospect.
"The China-U.S. relation is our common asset which needs us to care about together. "
He said that it was expected that people of insight from all sectors of both countries took practical actions to maintain the healthy and stable development of the China-U.S. relation and jointly drove the China-U.S. relation to move forward in the right direction.
Wang Yi also emphasized again that China was certain to take a development road different from that of the traditional great powers.
This road with Chinese characteristics determined that China would not or can not repeat the mistake of a strong country becoming a hegemon, and determined that China would not become another United States, or challenge the United States, or even replace the United States.
Wang Yi made a speech with the topic of "Opportunity or challenge, partner or opponent" and said that currently, the profound crux of the problem is that some American friends believed that China would also make a mistake of a strong country becoming a hegemon, and even challenge and replace the leadership of the United States in the world.
"This is obviously a major strategic misjudgment. "
He said that this self-imagined suspicion was spreading, and had amplified the existing contradictions, giving rise to new doubts, and making it more difficult for China and the United States to solve specific problems and encounter more resistance.
Wang Yi pointed out that the road China was walking on was a road for peaceful development.
Chinese people have never had a gene for expansion.
It was believed that all countries can live in harmony, and make exchanges and mutual learning.
Regardless of past, present or future, China would never copy foreign models, or require other countries to copy China's practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with Kissinger, the former U.S. Secretary of State, in New York, he said that China-U.S. cooperation would be win-win and the confrontation would be necessarily lose-lose.
The Chinese side was always committed to developing the long-term, healthy and stable China-U.S. relation and achieving no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.

"Where can we take a taxi?
We'd like to go to the Golden Bauhinia Square to watch the National Day flag-raising ceremony! "
In the morning of October 1, Mr and Mrs Song, who specially flew from Ningxia to Shenzhen and transferred to the first train of Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link for National Day, accepted an interview of a reporter from China News at the West Kowloon station in Hong Kong and inquired such information.
In the morning of October 1, in order to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong SAR Government held a grand flag-raising ceremony at the Golden Bauhinia Square.
According to the statistics of the Immigration Control Point, as of September 30, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via the West Kowloon station of the high-speed railway have exceeded 300,000.
At the very time of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the West Kowloon boundary checkpoint predicts a peak of visitors to Hong Kong on October 1 and 2.
The reporter saw at the arrival lobby around 7:00 a.m. on October 1 that many mainland tourists took advantage of the National Day Golden Week, to take the high-speed rail and visit Hong Kong.
Mrs Song with light-footedness told the reporter that the National Day holiday was a rare long holiday in a year. It has always been her wish to come to the Golden Bauhinia Square in Hong Kong to watch the flag-raising ceremony. She felt very happy and excited to be able to accomplish this will on National Day.
But currently, the flights between Ningxia and Hong Kong are inconvenient. Thanks to the opening of the high-speed railway for the Hong Kong segment. Mr Song checked the train schedule and found that the first train could arrive at 7:03 a.m., and it was perfect timing for taking urban transportation means to the Golden Bauhinia Square.
He told the reporters, "the high-speed railway is very convenient, fast and on time! "
The 70 daily one-hour short-haul trains running between Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North, Futian and West Kowloon greatly facilitated the residents in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to visit Hong Kong.
After arriving in Hong Kong, Mr Liu, who lived in Shenzhen, was preparing to join his Hong Kong friends at the top of a hill in Central.
Mr Liu said, "both the mainland and Hong Kong have holidays on National Day. We intend to challenge ourselves and see if we can complete walking the 50-kilometer Hong Kong Trail! "
He explained that they would not dare to make such a long trek without the convenience and sufficient time brought about by the high-speed railway.
Mrs Yang, who came from Dongguan, took her 10-year-old son to come to Hong Kong to participate in the piano competition by taking the high-speed railway. She proudly told the reporter that her son had been studying piano for three years, and it was very meaningful to spend the National Day in this way.
She had previously come to Hong Kong by bus, but it was time-consuming and laborious. She was worried about affecting her son's condition. This time she came from Shenzhen by high-speed railway. The customs clearance was convenient and the time was reduced by half. She was more impressed by the trip in Hong Kong segment. She told the reporter, "it seems like taking the subway, which is very fast. I am not able to do take photos before arriving! "

A few minutes later, the train entered the Hong Kong segment of Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link. This was the first formally operated high-speed train in the Hong Kong segment.
The Hong Kong segment of the high-speed railway, which integrates the national 25,000-kilometer high-speed rail network and reaches 38 long-distance stations throughout the country, also welcomes mainland tourists from different provinces far apart from each other.
Mr Gao, who took advantage of minor vacation to visit relatives in Hong Kong from Changsha, told the reporter that previously, the high-speed railway could only travel to Shenzhen North, and he needed to take the subway to pass through Hong Kong, and then take urban transportation means. It was troublesome and time-consuming to make transfers. Now, he can travel directly to the center of Kowloon and have lunch which was made by his children when getting home. He felt very happy.
He said that the "one port and two immigration inspection" customs clearance procedure were very convenient beyond imagination, and "passing both customs within 10 minutes. "
The West Kowloon Station, which is close to the Airport Express and connects land and air traffic, has also become the preferred destination for many transit passengers.
Miss Wu, from Fujian Province, prepared to spend the Golden Week with her friends traveling from Hong Kong to Philippines. Pushing her luggage out of the gate on time in West Kowloon, she told the reporter without hesitation, "I was afraid of not catching up with the plane, but I didn't think it would be so fast and that was more than enough!

If Trump imposes a so-called "Chapter 232" tariff on cars for national security reasons, Mexico and Canada will have a tax-exempt quota of 2.6 million passenger cars exported to the United States each year.
According to the subsidiary arrangement, the pickup trucks manufactured in both countries will be fully exempted from tariffs.
If Trump imposes auto tariffs, Mexico will receive a tax exemption quota of $108 billion each year for auto parts, and Canada will receive a quota of $32.4 billion.
These two quotas are far higher than the current production levels of the two countries, and provide their exports with growth space.
Report of Reuters on September 28 in Washington/Mexico: Mexico said on Friday that after days of debates, the U.S. President Trump's government and Canada were making real efforts to resolve trade policy differences, raising hopes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would maintain the form of a tripartite agreement.
Despite lack of details, the obvious progress mentioned above is enough to prompt the Mexican and American governments to abruptly stop publishing the text of the two-party trade agreement and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the Mexican president-elect, told the reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government had made new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and said he would continue to urge these three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Ildefonso Guajardo, the Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs, said the time for submitting the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement to the legislation departments of Mexico and the United States had been delayed because the Canadian and American governments tried to reach an agreement "very seriously".
Guajardo said, "In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we will get a text of a tripartite agreement or have to publish the text of the two-party agreement. "
Guajardo said that the officials at the same level in the U.S. and Canada had "special requests" to postpone to publish the text.
The spokesman of the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the bilateral trade agreement between the United States and Mexico and the negotiations between the United States and Canada.
Officials of the Prime Minister's Office and the Office of Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
According to foreign media reports, it was hard for people to find anything unusual in two little lions playing in a conservation center located in the suburb in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, but they were absolutely unique.
University of Pretoria announced: "They are the first lions in the history, which are born by artificial insemination -- the first pair of lions in the world. "
The scientists of the university were committing themselves to studying the reproductive system of female African lions.
Ganswindt, the director of Mammal Institute of University of Pretoria, said that these two little lions born on August 25 were a female lion and a male lion. They were pretty healthy and quite normal.
After the intensive tests in 18 months, his team finally made this breakthrough.
Ganswindt said in a media interview: "We collected the sperms from a healthy male lion. "
Next, the researchers waited for the hormones in the female lion to reach a proper level so as to conduct the artificial insemination in it.
Ganswindt said: "Fortunately, the result turned out to be successful. "
He said that the researchers "tried many times, but to their surprise, it didn't take much effort".
He said that the above-mentioned research breakthrough could be verified repeatedly, and the scientists hoped to use this technology to save the endangered big cats.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature indicated that the lion had already become extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of survival wild lions had declined sharply by 43% in the past 20 years with only about 20,000 wild lions left.
The African lion was listed as vulnerable by this organization.
Ganswindt said: "This animal will be in danger of extinction if we do nothing for them. "
He said that with this kind of new technology, it's not necessary for the lions to be fed. The sperms could be injected into the bodies of female lions, just like the approach adopting on the elephants in captivity in North America and Europe.
The exports of South Korea fell the most in more than two years in September, but analysts put the blame of the decline on fewer working days and said that although the trade tension between China and the United States rose, the global demand for South Korean goods remained strong.
Indeed, the average daily exports of South Korea increased last month.
Moreover, the initial value data released earlier showed that the exports in first weeks of September during the long vacation had a double-digit increase.
The year-on-year drop of South Korean exports in September was the largest since July 2016, which was more than the decrease of 5.7% estimated by 11 analysts of Reuters surveys.
The initial value released on Monday showed that the amount of exports in September was $50.6 billion, lower than $51.2 billion in August.
Although the China-US trade disputes with intensifying concerns might cause other neighboring countries of China which depended on exports to suffer, Korean exports to China in September increased by 7.8%, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month.
Since the sales of oil products declined, Korean exports to America decreased by 11.8%.
Although the market worried that the so-called "supercycle" of chips might reach the peak, the overseas sales of Korean memory chips and oil products increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively.
"However, the influence of trade conflicts cannot be avoided, because Korean exports considerably depend on American and Chinese markets. "
The imports decreased by 2.1% to $40.8 billion, inferior to the increase of 3.1% estimated by the Reuters survey.
The initial value of trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, higher than $6.9 billion in August.
The Department of Industry said that thanks to America and the EU countries, the global manufacturing would maintain buoyant, which was a favorable factor for Korean exports.
The statement pointed out, "the increasing export price caused by the rise of the oil price will be beneficial to the exports in the second half of this year. "
"However, the trade conflict between the United States and China continues and the market fluctuation after rising U.S. interest rates intensifies, which are both negative pressure on exports. "
The average exports of each working day in September increased to $2.6 billion, while the amount in August was $2.1 billion.
The Mid-Autumn Festival in South Korea this year was from September 24-26 so that there were only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.
The Korean exports from January to September increased by 4.7% compared with that of the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers Index, activities of Korean manufacturing rose again in September which was supported by domestic orders, since Chinese and Japanese orders declined, which would probably cast a shadow over export prospects.
North Korean media criticized the United States for not easing the sanctions on North Korea.
North Korea's "Rodong Shinmun" published a signatured review article on September 30 to criticize the United States for not easing the sanctions on North Korea while seeking to have a dialogue with North Korea. The article said that it was a "self-contradictory" action.
The article said that Pompeo, the United States Secretary of State, indicated on September 14 that "the key to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was to impose the sanctions on North Korea" to emphasize that the United States would keep its position on implementing the UN resolution to impose sanctions.
In the North Korea-US Joint Statement of Singapore, the two sides promised to build a new North Korea-US relation, which complied with the two peoples' wishes of looking forward to peace and prosperity.
On one side, the United States increased the intensity of sanctions, but on the other side, it asked for the dialogue. Undoubtedly, its actions were self-contradictory.
According to the article, if it wanted to build a new North Korea-US relation, establish a permanently consolidated system of peace in the Korean Peninsula, and achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it would put building trust in the first place, start from what can be done, and solve the problems by stages.
The article also said that the United States should understand that it wouldn't work to impose sanctions on North Korea.
The article said that even the "Severodvinsk" preceded the "Kazan" was admired by the U.S. military.
The National Interest quotes the view of US Navy as saying, "we will encounter a strong potential opponent. It is enough to see the "Severodvinsk" submarine only. "
Foggo, the current commander in chief of the U.S. navy in Europe, also highly praised the "Severodvinsk" submarine.
He said, "this submarine is impressive. Look at the development of Russian navy and how they utilize resources and it will be known that their main efforts on the fields of research and development are firstly to strenghten the submarine fleet. "
However, the National Interest still considers the United States maintains the advantage against Russia in this field.
Foggo said, "I believe that western countries still have asymmetrical advantages. "
Previously, it was informed that the Russian navy would equip the "Kazan" submarine in 2019.
The multipurpose submarines of "Kazan", "Novosibirsk", "Krasnoyarsk" and "Arkhangelsk" are all of "Fraxinus-M" improved type, with displacement of 13,800 tons, depth of 520 m, staffing of 64, submerged speed of 31 knots. All the submarines will carry mines, torpedoes and "Kalibr" and "Onyx" cruise missiles.

Ignore the Threat of America!
EU may Reach Crude Oil Purchase Agreement with Iran
The US government announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November and even urge other countries to reduce imports of Iran oil.
However, the American allies did not seem to take the advice.
According to the US "New York Times", on 29th, during the interview, Zarif, Foreign Minister of Iran, revealed that although the United States threatened to sanction any country that does business with Iran, Tehran is approaching to reach an agreement on the sale of crude oil with EU.
The core purpose of this agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, which is to replace the dollar transaction in the form of barter or domestic currency.
The purpose of this approach is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from impeding financial transfers.
Meanwhile, although the EU is working on facilitating the agreement, some French and British officials are also worried that if the agreement is concluded, it will be the most overt confrontation between the EU and the United States against the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.
The US media said that in the one hour interview , Zarif’s words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement can "strip" the traditional American allies and effectively break the US’s attempts to cut Iran’s income.
"This can guarantee that we can sell oil and obtain benefits", Zarif believed. According to the agreement reached in 2015, each country has the legal rights to make trade contacts with Iran.
The head of Union for Foreign Affairs Policy, Federica Mogherini, also said recently that "no sovereign state or organization can accept other people to decide who they can trade with. "
However, she also predicted that before the US government carried out the next step of sanctions in November, US leaders could adopt a series of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries that have commercial intercourses with Tehran.
In May of this year, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that the agreement had deficiencies, saying that the agreement could not permanently prohibit Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US then threatened to ban companies that buy Iran oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.
This threat forced some companies to leave Tehran and made the Iranian currency dropped sharply.
Companies such as Airbus S.A.S. and French oil giant Total have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iran.
British and French officials said, the US government may "take the lead".
Unsurprisingly, according to a recent report by the Turkish media, the US sanctions did not seem to have a major impact on Iran’s oil exports.
Recently, Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh disclosed that no country other than South Korea has stopped buying Iran oil.
Both Zarif and Iran President Rouhani believed that the purpose of a series of US actions is to "seduce" Iran’s breach of the agreement.
Zarif also regarded the US serial blast as not worthy of consideration. When asked if the US would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed. "It is a regime change strategy, and this is the true purpose of the US. "

The reporter learned from the National Health Commission that the prevalence of malnutrition in our children and adolescents had reduced but the prevalence of overweight-obesity had significantly increased comparing to decades ago.
The expert pointed out that the most important concept to maintain a healthy weight was the "preventive treatment of disease". The scientific fitness and rational diet should be vigorously promoted.
According to the "Core Information on Health Education of Chinese Adolescents and Interpretation (2018 version)" released by the National Health Commission recently, the key to maintain a healthy weight was the rational diet and scientific movement.
The overweight, obesity and blind weight reduction were harmful to health.
The health hazard behind the "chubby children" couldn't be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, the head of National Institute for Nutrition and Health of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight-obesity could harm the adolescents' normal growth and development, have a negative impact on their mentality, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and even cause hypertension, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in children.
And the adolescents' overweight-obesity might continue into adulthood, which would increase the adolescents' risk of having chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes in their adulthood.
Ding Gangqiang said that the overweight rate was 9.6% and the obesity rate was 6.4% among Chinese children and adolescents of 6-17 years old according to the Nutrition and Health Status Inspection of Chinese Residents in 2010-2012. The sum of these two rates was 16%.
Meanwhile, the characteristics of overweight-obesity among children and adolescents were that the overweight-obesity rate was higher in boys than in girls, and it was higher in cities than in villages. The overweight-obesity rate had significantly increased in recent decades.
How would the adolescents deal with the overweight-obesity?
Zhang Li, the deputy director of Science Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of General Administration of Sport of China, indicated that the primary causes of adolescent obesity at present were excessive caloric intake and inadequate physical activity.
For this kind of simple obesity, we should lay emphasis on scientific movement and reasonable diet control.
Zhang Li pointed out that the most important concept to maintain a healthy weight was the "preventive treatment of disease", and an integral part of it was to conduct the all-round science popularization education of schools, parents and students, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity, and increase the adolescents' self-protection awareness.
The adolescents should take the periodic physical examination to monitor the growth and development index, such as height and weight, so that the problems of overweight and obesity could be discovered early and determined scientifically to take intervention measures in time.
For those adolescents who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gangqiang advised that starvation therapy or semi-starvation therapy should be avoided to control and lose weight in addition to the active and scientific arrangement of diet and movement since the adolescents are in a special physiological stage. They should not take drugs blindly to lose weight.

China News Service, Yichang, October 1 (reported by Guo Xiaoying and Liu Min) -- The newly revised "Three Gorges-Gezhouba Hydro Project Navigation Scheduling Regulation" (hereinafter referred to as "Scheduling Regulation") was officially enforced starting from October 1. After two years of navigation test, the Three Gorges ship lift was officially scheduled together with the navigation lock in a unified way.
On the first day of enforcing the new regulations, the navigation in Three Gorges-Gezhouba waters was in good order.
Three Gorges Navigation Authority released the first plan of security check at 21:00 on September 30, and carried out the security check on 160 ships, with 124 ships passing the security check.
The navigation authority arranged the first locking plan after the enforcement of new regulations at 14:00 on October, 1.
After the enforcement of new regulations, the plan of security check would be released once every day at 9:00 and 21:00, and the plan of passing dam would be released once every day at 14:00 and 20:00, so that the ships could flexibly arrange the plan of passing dam.
The "Classification Control" scheduling principle of ship passing dam was added in the "Scheduling Regulation". The priority of ship passing dam would be determined according to the functional localization of navigation lock and ship lift respectively. The short-term passenger ship passing dam would be adjusted to be in the same priority as the demonstration ship and integrity ship.
This is also the official scheduling of ship lift and navigation lock after the two-year navigation test of ship lift.
It was also the first time for big length-width demonstration ship and new energy driven ship of Chuanjiang River and Three Gorges Reservoir Region to be ranked in the priority.
At the same time, the "navigation scheduling management waters" were adjusted from the 180-kilometer waters close to dam to the 541.8-kilometer waters from Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to Shishou Yangtze River Bridge in the "Scheduling Regulation". And the "core waters", "water close to dam", "control waters" and "scheduling waters" were divided.
This action would help the ship choose the proper waters to wait for crossing the lock, avoiding excessive ships waiting for crossing the lock in the dam region.
The "Scheduling Regulation" also put forward the measures of integrity constraint for the rule-breaking ships according to the current characteristics of ship passing dam and waiting for crossing lock, such as canceling the declaration and delaying the time of passing dam for 24 hours.
After water storing of the Three Gorges, the navigation condition of the reservoir area was improved, accelerating the rapid development of shipping in Yangtze River.
According to data, the annual cargo throughput of Three Gorges ship lock and Gezhouba ship lock was increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 0.138 billion tons and 0.14 billion tons in 2017 respectively.
During the two-year navigation test of ship lift, 5767 ships and 0.1622 million people have passed, and the volume of goods transported was 1.7128 million tons.
Chen Dongyuan, the deputy director of Three Gorges Navigation Authority, said that the "Scheduling Regulation" played an active role in promoting the management of crossing lock in an honest way, relieving the pressure of ships waiting for crossing the lock in the dam region, and improving the navigation capacity.

Signed and approved by Premier Li Keqiang, the State Council printed and distributed the "Decision of the State Council on Further Reducing the Categories in the Catalogue of Industrial Products Subject to Production License Administration and Simplifying the Approval Procedures".
The "Decision" proposed to further reduce the categories in the catalogue of industrial products subject to production license administration, cancel the production license administration for 14 industrial products, and delegate the administration authority for production licenses of 4 types of industrial products to the quality and technical supervision departments of provincial people’s governments.
After this reform, the products that implement the industrial product production licenses administration will be reduced from last year’s 38 categories to the current 24 categories.
The "Decision" clearly simplifies the approval process for products in the catalogue.
First, the pre-certification product inspection organized by the issuing authority is changed to the product inspection conformity report issued by the qualified inspection and testing institution when the enterprise applies.
Second, in addition to dangerous chemicals, the products that have been licensed by the quality and technical supervision department (market supervision and management department) of the provincial people’s government shall be subject to post-site inspection. After the enterprise submits the application and product inspection conformity report and makes a commitment to ensure product quality and safety, the production license can be obtained after passing the formal examination, and then the on-site examination is accepted within the specified time.
Third, for enterprises produce different types of products in the production and operation catalogue, in accordance with the principle of "one enterprise, one license", when apply for a new license or apply for a license renewal, a license should be issued and examined.
The "Decision" requires that all regions and relevant departments should solidly promote the reduction of catalogue and simplify the examination and approval procedures.
Increase the commitment publicity of enterprises and post-site inspection work, strengthen credit supervision and restraint means, implement the responsibility of the main body of the enterprise, and revoke the production license for false promises and non-compliance.
For the products that cancel the production licenses administration for industrial products, it is necessary to strengthen the post supervision, and the products related to public health and safety, environmental protection, etc. can be converted into compulsory certification, list positive lists and publicize to the public, unify the certification standards and reasonably reduce and merge the certification and testing items, and the compulsory certification fees in principle should be borne by the financial institutions at all levels.
Take support measures to encourage enterprises to carry out voluntary certification and promote brand building and market expansion.
It is necessary to benchmark the international advanced standards and promote the quality of industrial products.
Give full play to the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality and safety of industrial products.
For products that retain industrial product production license administration, it is necessary to improve the standard system, give play to the advantages of industry supervision, strengthen the responsibility of "who approves and who supervise", dynamically assess product quality and safety risks, timely reduce catalogues, delegate approval authority or convert to certification administration.

Report of Reuters on November 5 in Nagoya: Haruhiko Kuroda, the president of the Bank of Japan said on Monday that the bank realized that the long-term implementation of ultra-easing monetary policy could squeeze the profit margins of financial institutions and destabilize the banking system of Japan.
However, he said that due to the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needed to maintain its large-scale incentive plans and pay close attention to the pros and cons of its policies.
"The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under the sustained monetary easing policy, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected," Haruhiko Kuroda said in a speech to the business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions were more active in taking risks to compensate for the effect of low interest rates on shrinking profit margins over the years, the banking system could be unstable in the event of serious negative impacts.
"Although these risks are not too big at present, the Bank of Japan will closely monitor the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take necessary measures," he said.
The minutes released by the Bank of Japan earlier on Monday showed that the policy committee of the Bank of Japan discussed the problem of rising costs of the long-term easing policy at the interest rate meeting in September.
The minutes showed that a member of the board said that if the economy continued to expand, "the Bank of Japan will have more flexibility in the aspect of policy in the future. "
The minutes showed that another member of the board said that due to the limits of policy duration, the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan can maintain the incentive policy.
Haruhiko Kuroda said that the Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks brought by the easing policy, and take into account the uncertainties centered on Japan's economic prospects, as China-U.S. trade frictions and rising protectionism might affect the global demand.
"The impact of such problems on Japan's economy is temporarily limited," Haruhiko Kuroda said.
"But if the problem persists, the impact on Japan's economy may increase," he added.
"It is necessary to sustain the strong monetary easing policy and consider both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner," Haruhiko Kuroda said.
Although the disadvantages of radical incentive plans were increasing, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, the low inflation forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Bank of Japan maintained the monetary policy last month; Haruhiko Kuroda ruled out the possibility of recent interest rate increase about the risks brought by the conflict of the global trade war.
On June 1, 2018, in Cardiff, the United States, the corporate identity on Tesla electric cars.
According to a settlement agreement, Tesla Motors and its CEO, Musk, had agreed to separately pay $20 million fines to the financial regulators, and Musk would resign as President of the company, but still held the post of CEO.
This settlement agreement would end two months of unrest in Tesla.
This settlement agreement on securities fraud charge released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Saturday would make investors relieved.
Investors were originally worried that the protracted legal battle would only further hit the electric car company, which was still losing money.
SEC prosecuted Musk for frauds on Thursday, saying that his tweet on August 7 misled the investors.
The tweet said that he was considering to privatize Tesla with $420 per share and had obtained financing.
SEC said that these tweets actually had no evidences and the volatility in market triggered by them had hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts said that this agreement could strengthen Tesla, which had been hit hard by Musk's recent actions.
Steven Heim, the leader of assets management company of Boston Common, said that this settlement agreement should let Musk receive more monitoring, but had not taken any "destructive" measures to throw him out of Tesla.
This assets management company held shares of Panasonic, the battery manufacturer of Tesla.
According to this proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint a independent president, two independent directors and a board committee to set out controls aiming at Musk’s external communications.
"This matter was resolved promptly according to the agreed conditions, which met the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
The charge on Thursday caused the market value of Tesla evaporate about $7 billion. The market value of this company was $45.2 billion, lower than $47.5 billion of General Motors.
SEC withdrew the requirement for throwing Musk out of the head position of the company.
Many investors said that this punishment would be catastrophic.
"I think it is the best possible result for all relevant staff," Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial Partners said. Feinseth gave a "neutral" evaluation to Tesla and said that the punishment of SEC was a "lighter punishment" to Musk.
"The fact that he still holds the position of CEO is very important to Tesla. "
Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the charge of SEC in the settlement agreement, or immediately replied to the request for commenting.
The settlement agreement still needed to get approval of the court.
Beijing Morning Post (reported by Wang Ping) -- The reporter of Beijing Morning Post learned from Beijing Construction Engineering Group a few days ago that the multi-colored ETFE jigsaw membrane structure would be adopted in the Performing Arts Plaza project of the International Horticultural Exhibition 2019 Beijing, which was one of the core building groups in the International Horticultural Exhibition 2019 Beijing park. The 5440-meter membrane structure would show 6 colors, including dark red, dark green, orange, blue, red, and green, and it would appear in the shape of "a butterfly flying up high" under the tension created by steel strand draglines.
According to the introduction made by Liu Changbao, the project leader of Beijing No. 5 Construction Engineering Group, the building area of the Performing Arts Plaza project was 4500 square meters, and the total amount of installed steal was 1182 tons. The steel roof was supported by the cantilever steel truss with a 26-beam umbrella arrangement. It would appear in the shape of "a butterfly flying up high" under the tension created by steel strand draglines.
"Taking a bird's-eye view of the Performing Arts Plaza, the colorful roof seems like a butterfly dancing among the flowers. And the bright colors will not fade even weathered rain and snow over time".
The single-colored ETFE membrane structure has been widely applied in the Bird's Nest, the Water Cube, and other projects, but this is the first time to use the multi-colored ETFE jigsaw membrane structure across the country.
The reported learned that every inch of the membrane structure was very "precious" since there were only a few suppliers capable of producing the multi-colored membrane structure around the world.
Liu Changbao said that the dragline head structure with "double ears" would also be adopted innovatively to aviod the problems of overlapping or "fighting" in the position of dragline head. A special fixed widget would be used to ensure the "fighted" dragline heads are packed in the correct position.
The construction of the International Horticultural Exhibition 2019 Beijing park is in progress at present.
The project of the International Hall has completed all hoisting construction works of "flower umbrella".
According to the plan, the project will be ready for arranging the exhibitions at the end of October.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private sector symposium, injecting a firm confidence into the broader stage of the private economy.
General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that "letting entrepreneurs unload their mental loads and march with light packs", which has a strong resonance among entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the magnificent course of the 40 years of reform and opening up, there are thousands of entrepreneurs entrepreneurship and innovation stories, the growth and expansion of entrepreneurs-group constantly push the Chinese economy to sail far.
For some time, some people in the society have published some remarks that negate and doubt the private economy.
The so-called "private economic departure theory" and "new public-private partnership theory" and other misconceptions have caused some entrepreneurs’ doubts and concerns.
Recently, some private enterprise have encountered many difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, the changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export enterprises; the rapid adjustment of the demand structure has brought about the pressure of transformation and upgrading; some policies are not coordinated with each other, the policy effects are superimposed in the same direction, or the working methods are simple, resulting in some policies with good original intentions have the opposite effect, etc.
All kinds of factors are intertwined, the private economy is facing difficulties, some private enterprises are facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety.
Under this context, it is particularly profound and practical to correct the cognition errors, let the entrepreneurs’ unload the mental load, let them develop wholeheartedly, make the government promote development devotedly and concern market confidence and development expectations.
This symposium once again emphasized the important assertion of the "Three no-changes": "There is no change in the role and function of non-public sector in our economic and social development"!
In recent years, from deepening the promotion of streamline administration and delegate more power to lower-level governments, establishing a power list system, and creating a legal environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, creating a market environment of fair competition and shaping the atmosphere of respecting entrepreneurs in the whole society, the Party Central Committee has attached unprecedented emphasis on entrepreneurs and institutional guarantees.
The symposium clearly stated the six aspects’ policy measures to vigorously support the development and expansion of private enterprises, and launched a series of pragmatic actions dedicated to the "march with light packs" of private enterprises.
These actions have greatly encouraged the entrepreneurial community and have given more expectations to the community.
The fog has been set aside, and the policy has been set. And the key aspect lies in implementation.
We must continue to create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve the difficulties in development, and help achieve China’s economic transformation and upgrading; let entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legal operations, and feel respected in social life, stimulate innovation and create potential.
The Chinese economy has stepped into a process of moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to display their ambitions and providing more spaces and stages for entrepreneurs to exert their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with further deepening reforms and removing obstacles, the private economy will greet better development prospects and opportunities and move toward a broader stage.
46 types of import and export supervision licenses in Inner Mongolia have all been verified online - China News
Report on November 5 in Inner Mongolia of China News (reported by Li Aiping): the Hohhot Customs said on November 5 that 46 types of local import and export supervision licenses were verified online from that day, except for confidentiality requirements and other special circumstances.
The enterprises in Inner Mongolia can declare relevant documents to the Customs in paperless way, so as to avoid the problems of rushing around on site, paper application, repeated submission, etc.
It was known that the preparation time of documents referred to the preparation time of various types of documents required for import and export before declaration, which was a major factor that affected the overall clearance time. In order to compress the clearance time and reduce the clearance costs, the documents must be reduced.
Previously, there were 86 types of supervision documents in the import and export process which required customs examination, involving 19 departments.
It was reported that according to the principle of "to cancel what can be canceled, to merge what can be merged and to withdraw what can be withdrawn from port inspection" this time and relying on the international trade "single window" platform, the Customs and other 16 license-issuing authority systems made docking and data interconnection, to achieve more data flows and less enterprise errands.
The customs said that in the past, enterprises had to go back and forth to the onsite office hall of the relevant authorities to submit paper applications. The process was long and it was impossible to track the verification status in real time.
Now the enterprise users can directly log into the "single window" portal to apply online.
Upon approval of the license-issuing authority, the electronic data of the certificate would be transmitted to the Customs, and automatic comparison and intelligent examination of the Customs declaration data would be done in the Customs clearance process. All the examination results would be sent back to the enterprise through the "single window", which can make the whole process of declaration, examination, customs clearance and feedback of supervision documents complete online.
Exports of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China surged 20 times in four years, which may be related to the increase of empty-nest youth - China News
Exports of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China surged 20 times in four years; analysis: it is related to the increase of empty-nest youth
According to the report on Day 5 of Yonhap, last year, the export sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China exceeded 100,000 US dollars, which surged 20 times compared with that of four years ago, in 2013.
The analysis suggests that this growth is related to the hot sales of convenience food driven by the increasing number of empty-nest youth in China, as well as the increasing attention of young people on nutritious meals.
This data is published by the Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corp (aT) on Day 5.
Last year, the export sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China was 100,339 US dollars and the weight was 21,859 kg, which surged by 2094% and 3668.8 % respectively compared with that in 2013.
The analysis suggests that the increasing sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup in China are related to the hot sales of convenience food driven by the increasing number of empty-nest youth in China, as well as the increasing attention of young people on nutritious meals.
By the end of this year, the number of one-person households in China have exceeded 200 million, and it is expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020. Local food enterprises are also aiming at the “eating-alone people" and launching various convenience food.
Moreover, the analysis also indicates that bird flu is the biggest factor which prevents ginseng chicken soup from taking root in the Chinese mainland market.
aT says that bird flu outbroke in South Korea from November 2016 to April of last year. Relevant departments comprehensively ban the export of ginseng chicken soup to China which leads to sharp reduction of export sales.
In 2016, the export sales of ginseng chicken soup in China was 840,000 US dollars. Due to bird flu, the export sales of last year plummeted to 100,000 US dollars.

A gateway flag-raising ceremony is held in Hekou port on China-Vietnam boarder to celebrate the National Day.
"I didn't expect to see such a spectacular flag-raising ceremony on the frontier. It is more amazing to watch the flag-raising here than in the mainland. "
In the morning of October 1, Mr Zhang, who came from Sichuan to visit Hekou port in Yunnan on China-Vietnam boarder, watched the gateway flag-raising ceremony together with more than 500 army officers and soldiers, local people, and Chinese and foreign tourists to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Hekou port is the biggest port on China-Vietnam boarder in Yunnan. It is located in Hekou county in Honghe Prefecture in Yunnan Province with just a river away from Lao Cai City in Vietnam. It is a first-class national port.
With the continuous enhancement of "One Belt and One Road" construction in China, as one of the most convenient passage connecting China and Southeast Asia, Hekou port has a steady growth of departure and entry flow.
At 7:30 in the early morning of the same day, a ray of sunshine just showed in the sky. The local people and Chinese and foreign tourists had gathered in the restricted areas in Hekou port very early to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 7:45, the flag-raising ceremony started on time. The members of gateway honor guard of Hekou Frontier Inspection Station were in high spirits and walked with vigorous steps escorting the national flag to the flag tower.
After the flag-raising command made by the commander, the flag raiser waved his arm hard to draw an arc. The bright five-star red flag stretched out like an "eagle stretching its wings", and rose slowly with the melody of the majestic and impassioned national anthem.
"It not only shows China's image, but also inspires the patriotism among people of all nationalities in border areas to held a flag-raising ceremony on every New Year's day, Spring Festival, National Day, and other time nodes of great significance. "
A member of the honor guard taking part in this flag-raising ceremony said.

From a 3-member flag-raising team to a large-scale honor guard, it has developed in more than 60 years. Since its establishment, it has performed more than 70 national-level tasks in foreign affairs as the honor guard.
The newly revised Individual Income Tax Law will adjust the criterion for resident taxpayers of China’s Individual Income Tax Law from one year to 183 days.
On 30th, the relevant principals from the Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China and State Administration of Taxation said that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new Individual Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
The principals expressed that the current effective Individual Income Tax Law’s enforcement regulations have special preferential provisions for taxation issues for foreigners. For individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived for more than one year and less than five years and earn incomes from outside China, their part of the payment by domestic units or individuals is subject to individual income tax.
The portion of the overseas payment does not need to pay personal income tax in China.
The Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China, the State Administration of Taxation, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Commerce also issued notices to expand the scope of application of no withholding income tax policy for overseas investors with distribution of profit investment.
For the profit distributed by overseas investors from domestic enterprises in China used for the scope of application of no withholding income tax policy for domestic direct investment, the foreign investment encouraged projects should be extended to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and fields.
During the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, the parties released some positive information for the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in related the "irreversible" denuclearisation determination as told by the DPRK and said that US President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of this year.
The US State Department subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompeo will visit the DPRK in October to promote the implementation of the US-DPRK leadership meeting in Singapore.
From the beginning of this year to the present, the DPRK and the ROK broke the ice and opened the dialogue, and the DPRK - ROK and the DPRK-US leaders held meetings. The general trend of the easing of the peninsula has been continued, and the dialogue’s principle of solving the peninsula issue has also been adhered to.
First of all, the fact that "the essence of the peninsula issue is a security issue" has not changed. The key to realizing peace on the peninsula is to resolve the reasonable security concerns of all parties in a proper and balance manner, instead of putting pressure on the other side and stressing own demands.
Secondly, in the dialogue to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned are still divided on the steps and ways to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula. Due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the game thinking of "who is first and who is second" is still strong.
At the public meeting of the UN Security Council Korean Peninsula issue held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of the parties around the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted the two points on the peninsula that have not changed.
Pompeo, US Secretary of State, insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula is fully denuclearized.
Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister, stressed the principle of "responding to action by action". He pointed out: "The weakening trend of sanctions should be in synchronization with the pace taken by North Korea on the road of gradual denuclearization."
Undoubtedly, all parties concerned should continue to implement the North Korea related resolutions of the UN Security Council in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner. However, pressuring is not an end. The implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are all requirements of the UN Security Council resolutions. The two cannot be neglected, and cannot only choose one
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in the DPRK-ROK and DPRK-US relations, China believes that it is necessary for the UN Security Council to consider launching reversible clauses in a timely manner, thereby encouraging North Korea and relevant parties to take a big move toward denuclearization.
Review the past, every development in the denuclearization of the peninsula and in the peace process requires the parties to demonstrate sufficient political courage.
At present, in the face of the international community’s increasingly high expectations for promoting a political solution to the peninsula issue, all parties concerned should demonstrate political courage, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve problems, and continue to take the opposite direction and advance peninsula denuclearization process and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula to jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.
A message from Ji County People's Government in Linfen City in Shanxi Province on October 1 indicated that the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River located in this county would maintain higher levels of water during the National Day holiday, so it didn't meet the requirements to be open to the public.
In order to ensure the safety, the scenic areas will be temporarily closed during the National Day holiday.
Hukou Falls of Yellow River is the second biggest fall in China, and the biggest yellow fall in the world.
The Yellow River flows here at great speed, and the stone walls on both sides are rising steeply. The river mouth becomes narrow like the spout of kettle, forming the situation that "a thousand miles of Yellow River seems like to be collected into a kettle".
The reporter learned that the flood season of yellow river would come in every June to October. Due to high levels of water, the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River in Shanxi Province had been closed one after another since July 12, 2018. Therefore, according to the accumulative calculation, Hukou scenic areas had been closed for nearly a month.
Ni Yufeng, the chief engineer of Hukou Scenic Areas Management Committee, said to the media that it was the longest time for the Yellow River to keep high levels of water during the past 20 years. "It hasn't been closed for such a long time. We closed it for four days in the flood season in 2017. However, it has been closed for nearly a month. "
It was learned that the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River in Shanxi Province had originally arranged extra staff and vehicle maintenance in advance in order to be well-prepared for the "National Day" golden week, and even the temporary staff had been hired.
According to the "Notice on Being Well-prepared for the Flood Control in the Yellow River during the National Day Holiday" issued in the "Office Telegram of Yellow River Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters", Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong were required to be well-prepared for the flood control in the Yellow River during the National Day holiday.
Currently, the flow of the main stream of the Yellow River is relatively large. The upstream river flow is maintained at 2000-3000 cubic meters per second, the midstream river flow is maintained at 2500―3500 cubic meters per second, and the downstream river flow is maintained at 3000 cubic meters per second.
The health center and the health station specially provide influenza vaccination services during the National Day Holidays
The health station has ordered 150,000 doses of the 2018-2019 four-strain flu vaccine this year and at this stage, free vaccination is preferentially provided for high-risk people. To facilitate the citizens to vaccinate with flu vaccine during the holiday, all the health centers and health stations under the Health Bureau will specially provide vaccination services from 9 am to 1 pm during the National Day Holidays ( October 1 through 2).
In addition to the above-mentioned convenience measures, all the health centers and health stations under the Health Bureau have extended their influenza vaccination service time to 8 pm from Monday to Friday. By 4 pm on September 30, 4,158 people had been vaccinated, which was more than that of the same period last year for 3,714 people.
Free vaccination objects include the following Macao residents: people under the age of 6 months to 18 years, people at the age of 50 and above, pregnant women, all patients with chronic diseases (including fat people, namely, the persons whose body mass index (BMI) is 30 or more), staff of institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools and middle schools, all the health workers and the Macao residents who work in the casino.
Meanwhile, for the other people who are considered to be necessary to vaccinate by the Health Bureau, including the personnel of the public sectors, the Health Bureau will take the initiative to contact the relevant authorities to obtain the list and then the health centers will arrange them for vaccination.
To facilitate the vaccinees and reduce the waiting time for vaccination, the Health Bureau will send medical staff to Macao middle schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries from October to December to perform collective influenza vaccination to the children, students, teachers and staff; in addition, the Health Bureau will also arrange staff to go to the institutions of the elderly and disabled, public sectors or other institutions with a large number of people to perform collective influenza vaccination.
Students and children who fail to participate in the collective vaccination can take Macao resident identity cards, user cards of the Health Bureau, influenza vaccination cards (if any), student identity cards, employee identity cards or occupational certificates to the vaccination station of the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário or health centers from December 3, 2018.
The Health Bureau reminds residents that people who vaccinated with the 2017-2018 flu vaccine during September 2017 and August 2018 still need to vaccinate with the new seasonal flu vaccine from September 2018, since the flu antigen composition of 2018-2019 flu vaccine in the Northern Hemisphere has been updated , which is targeted at the seasonal influenza in winter of 2018-2019 and summer of 2019 in the Northern Hemisphere.
The peak of influenza in Macao usually occurs from January till March every year, later than that of the temperate regions (such as Northern China and Japan).

Report of Reuters on October 1 in Tokyo: A quarterly Tankan survey report released by the Bank of Japan on Monday showed that the confidence of Japanese major manufacturers hit its lowest level in more than a year for that season in September, as raw material costs rose and a series of natural disasters affected production, putting pressure on enterprises.
This survey almost didn’t show that the escalating global trade frictions shook the confidence of large manufacturers.
However, risks of outbreak of an all-out trade war stuck the business prospects of enterprises, likely to threaten the business capital expenditure.
The active capital expenditure is a highlight of Japanese economy.
This survey raised questions about the view of the Bank of Japan on that robust economic expansion would help to accelerate inflation to the 2% target, although there were signs that enterprises were gradually shifting costs to the customers.
"With concerns raised by the global trade war, as exports slowed down and factory production weakened, the confidence of manufacturers tended to stagnate," said Takeshi Minami, the Principal Researcher of Norinchukin Research Institute Co., Ltd..
"Confident is still at a high level. And since corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to decline. "
The Tankan survey showed that the judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing declined from positive 21 for three months ago to positive 19 in September, worsening for the third consecutive quarter.
The median market forecast is positive 22.
The judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing declined from positive 24 researched in June to positive 22 in September, worsening for the first time for eight quarters.
The survey of Reuters was positive 22.
The survey showed that the judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing was expected to remain stable in December.
Investors were indifferent to the decline of the judgment index for the boom of Tankan enterprises. The Nikkei .N225 rose to a 27-year high spot on Monday as the continued depreciation of the yen helped improve the export profit prospects of Japanese enterprises.
The capital expenditure was robust.
Although the confidence of enterprises declined, the latest Tankan highlighted the robustness of enterprise capital expenditure plans, benefiting from the renewed capacity and increased investment in robots and automation to cope with the labor shortage caused by the aging of population.
The Tankan survey of the Bank of Japan showed that the capital expenditure of large-scale enterprise plans would increase by 13.4% for the fiscal year ended in March 2019.
It was 13.6% for previous Tankan survey.
Takeshi Minami said that the capital expenditure of all enterprise plans for this fiscal year increased by 8.5%, close to the pace of Japan’s bubble era.
He said, "considering that small businesses raise their profit estimates from now on, there is still room for further growth in capital expenditure, but that largely depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence. "
The Tankan survey showed that the ability of enterprises to pass on costs was enhanced. The output price index of large enterprises was positive 7, which was a 10-year high spot. It was an encouraging sign, reflecting that Japan had made progress in its efforts to combat deflation.
The index measuring the employment situation of large enterprises hit negative 23, which was the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.
Benefiting from the robust enterprise expenditure, Japanese economy rebounded from January-March shrink in the second quarter.
However, the escalation of trade frictions in summer and the disturbance of natural disasters on supply chains had casted a shadow over the prospects of Japanese economy which depended on exports.
In dollar terms, import and export of services increase by 16.4%.

Subsequently, the OPEC Production Cut Conference explicitly refused to increase production, giving market confidence to believe that the oil prices will move up steadily. "
Zhuochuang Information refined oil product analyst Zang Wengang said.

Report of Reuters on November 5 in Beijing: According to a press release released on Sunday by the China Foreign Trade Center, the Canton Fair showed that the situation of China's foreign trade was still complex and serious, with expectation of 80.6% of enterprises exports in 2018 to be better than or maintain at the same level as last year.
However, in consideration of the rising costs of domestic raw materials, labor force and other comprehensive factors, as well as the external environment of the increasing impact of Sino-US trade frictions, exhibitors also believed that the export situation of next year was not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, the deputy secretary-general and spokesman of the Canton Fair, and the vice-director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions of this Canton Fair had declined slightly compared with the same period of last year.
The number of buyers who attended this Canton Fair was 189,812 and they came from 215 countries and regions, with a decrease of 1.11% on year-on-year basis.
The amount of export transactions was 206.494 billion yuan ($29.86 billion), with a decrease of 1% on year-on-year basis.
From the perspective of the market, the transactions with Japan, the ten ASEAN countries, "the BRICS countries" and Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, while the transactions with traditional markets of the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively.
From the perspective of the industry, the transactions of transportation tools, machinery and equipment, building and decorative materials, electronic consumer goods, information products, and sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0% and 15.1% respectively, while the transactions with textile clothing and household appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer and weathervane of China's foreign trade, the buyers’ participation situation and the export transaction data of this Canton Fair showed that China's foreign trade development would still face many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the deepening of supply-side structural reform and the "six stability" policies and measures recently introduced by the state and local governments in succession, the new drivers for the development of China’s foreign trade was accelerating the accumulation, and the diversification of enterprises and markets had made new progress, all of which were the important foundation and strong conditions for the development of foreign trade.
"Taking all factors into consideration, it is expected that the imports and exports of China's foreign trade will maintain a steady growth throughout the year, with further improvement in quality and efficiency. " Xu Bing said.
The China’s General Administration of Customs published that priced in dollars, the exports in September increased by 14.5% on year-on-year basis, the imports increased by 14.3% on year-on-year basis, the trade surplus in September was $31.69 billion, and the export growth rate and trade surplus in September were the highest since February.
In despite of the escalating trade frictions between China and the United States, China's export performance in September still significantly exceeded expectation. Strong external demand, and the enterprises rushing to export before imposing tariffs in the United States and the depreciation of RMB exchange rate, might be the main supporting factors, and also showed the resilience of China's foreign trade to a certain extent. However, the impact of the Sino-US trade war on confidence and the industrial chain can not be neglected. Analysts believed that the challenges for China's foreign trade might emerge in the fourth quarter or next year.
Reuters surveys showed that the U.S. fund managers proposed to increase cash holdings and stood the cautious ground in September, since the United States and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs and there was no sign of dispute easing.
However, according to the suggestion of 12 fund managers who participated in this survey, the asset allocation in North America rose to the highest level since June 2017, while positions in Britain, the Eurozone and particularly emerging markets declined.
The average of global stock allocation accounted for 56.6% and the bonds accounted for 35.5%, which was basically consistent with the survey of last month.
The most obvious change was that the cash ratio rose to 5.1%, which was the highest proportion since December 2014.
A fund manager of a large fund company said, "Some economic data have brought confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so that it's better to get prepared to enter when the market falls after a rise. "
However, the fund managers still preferred stocks in September, especially American stocks, even though the price of American stocks were considered to be on the high side.
Today, in Shanghai, the opening-up landmark of China, China International Import Expo (CIIE), the world's first large-scale state-level exhibition with the theme of import, has officially opened in much anticipation.
An exhibition is like a "window" which can let the world know a city and a country better.
Through the "window" of CIIE, people can see the "opening-up China" which moves towards a higher level; with the help of the "window" of CIIE, we welcome the world and China which is "restarting from reform and opening-up", to achieve mutual benefits and win-win results.
"For a country, opening-up is like coming out of the cocoon and becoming a butterfly. There will be pain, but there will be new life. "
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of Open Road reveals an important reason "why China can do it".
Looking back on the past 40 years of reform and opening-up, China dares to plunge into the vast sea of the world market. Although it has encountered whirlpool and storm, it always faces all risks and challenges with an open attitude, constantly releases its endogenous driving force and continuously improves its competitiveness.
So to speak, China has fully demonstrated the value and significance of opening-up with its solid achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point, it is a major decision to hold an expo with the theme of import made by the Party Central Committee with the core of Comrade Xi Jinping with a view to promoting a new round of high-level opening to the outside world. It is a major measure for China to actively open the market to the world and is also a practical action taken by China to support the economic globalization and trade liberalization, showing a strong and clear will that "China's opening door won't close, but would open wider and wider".
Exhibitors from all over the world are eager to enroll in the exhibition, and "it is difficult to apply for a stand", which is the greatest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a larger scope, a wider range of fields and at a deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroad.
Some countries have built trade protectionist walls and retreated into the unilateralism, which increases anxiety of the international society about the prospects for free trade and adds much uncertainty to a recovering world economy.
Under such era background, this grand gathering along the Huangpu River demonstrates China's guard to free trade and shows the world China's confidence and responsibility to open its markets and share its future.
It is fast to go alone but it is further to go in crowds.
By embracing the world with an open mind, China has not only vigorously promoted its own development, but also brought about tremendous "China opportunities" to other countries and regions.
In recent years, by advocating and promoting the joint development of the "One Belt and One Road", initiating and setting up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and establishing the Silk Road fund... China has provided a series of international public goods, a solid export market, development opportunities and jobs, allowing companies of various countries to get a ride on the "express train" and take "hitchhiking" of China's development.
CIIE is also this kind of public goods and a big platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have made their debut with high-quality products and services with distinctive features, taking a new step into the Chinese market.
Apart from companies of various countries, the real beneficiaries are domestic consumers.
By building the platform of "selecting the best and importing the best", we can provide multiple channels of high-quality supply for consumption upgrading and meet people's personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs.
As China's opening-up door opens wider and wider, the goods flow is smooth and materials are put to good use, thus the pace towards a better life will be more solid.
From a broader perspective, the significance of CIIE has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade. It has the future in mind, conveys the concepts of openness, inclusiveness, universal benefit, balance and win-win, and forms a consensus to jointly meet today's challenges.
Only when the world is doing well can China do well; when China is good, the world is better.
We expect CIIE to make the world wonderful and complete; we are looking forward to the bright future that an "opening-up China" moving to a higher level and the world build a community of human destiny.
Foreign media report that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[Abstract] The content of the Agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and a temporary suspension of U.S. tariffs on the cars produced in Canada.
It is reported by foreign media that a Canadian source said in the evening of September 30 at local time that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It is revealed that the content of the Agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and a temporary suspension of U.S. tariffs on the cars produced in Canada.
On Day 27 of last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary principled agreement on updating the North American Free Trade Agreement while the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement before the deadline set by the American side of August 31 and extended the negotiation deadline to September 30.
Previously, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said that Canada would only sign a favorable agreement, and "the focus is on substance rather than timetables. We will continue to consult in the hope of reaching an agreement that is in line with the national interests of Canada. "
Over 90% of Brazilian female voters said that the presidential candidate did not consider women’s needs.
According to the Overseas Chinese News Network of South America, data released by Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) recently showed that more than 90% of Brazilian women do not think that the presidential candidate considers the needs of women.
According to the report, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million. If women from all over Brazil are brought together to form a country, the country’s population will rank 13th in the world, more than twice the population of Spain.
In Brazil, the number of the women voters accounts for 52% of the total number of voters, and men account for 48%. Although the proportion of women among voters is very high, the proportion of women in the National Congress of Brazil is only 10%.
Among the 193 countries in the world, Brazilian women’s participation in politics ranks only 154th, higher than that of Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of power struggle, Brazilian women still have not succeeded in obtaining their reserved rights.
According to Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori, the existence of this phenomenon is because of the combined effects of ancient patriarchal society, racialism, and capitalism values.
"Politics should be civil rights, identity, access to public goods, and the formation of the same society by multiple social groups advocated by citizens. But the politics of Brazil belong to a monopoly of a certain group, and most of the population is not represented. "
A previous study by the Locomotiva also pointed out that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that the politicians elected by the election can represent their rights, and 90% of Brazilian women disagree with the decisions made by politicians. 93% of women disagree with the current government policy.
"We need to reverse the problem of underrepresentation of women in National Congress, and Brazil’s political system is still affected by inequality. So far, there has been serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the political field in Brazil. " Natalia Mori said.
Although there is the lack of women’s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey shows that 76% of women believe they can make a difference in democratic elections, and 72% of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to expose women to less prejudice.

Although Barclays is optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy by the end of this year, the bank acknowledges that it is more difficult to predict the longer term.
"Under the circumstance that is lack of more sustainable investment growth to boost economic growth potential, current fiscal policy-driven growth will be unsustainable," Economist Barclays indicated in a research report.
"On the occasion of being lack of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing of economy in 2020 will rise," they said.

The Eurozone and American manufacturing surveys, which is scheduled for release next Monday, will be given attention and a service sector survey will be released on Wednesday.
However, the focus of data for next week will definitely be the American non-farm employment data, which will be released next Friday. This data will provide clues for whether the tight job market is driving large wage growth.
Its importance is not only for the reason that it is important for corporate profitability and consumer purchasing power, but also because wage jumps may cause overall inflation, which may upset the officials of the Federal Reserve Board.
"Salaries will be of great concern, as they may rise sharply again compared with the last month.
In September, the growth may not exceed 3% over the same period last year, but we can fully expect a breakthrough next month," ING economists wrote in a research report.
On the occasion that holidays in China and other regions of Asia lead to a bleak data for the region next week, the European political situation may become a source of market volatility.

ECNS, Qingdao, October 1 -- Affected by Typhoon Trami, the first race day of 2018 Qingdao "Mazarin" Cup powered by Extreme Sailing Series was postponed from September 30 to October 1, and the pre-game meeting was held before the race in Olympic Sailing Center in Qingdao. The captains of 12 hydrofoil catamaran teams from 6 countries and regions attended at the meeting.
Affected by Typhoon Trami, the strong winds constantly blew in the harbor basin and the maximum wind speed even reached 24 knots. The sailing signal was delayed by nearly 90 minutes from 1:00 pm on September 30. The wind speed was still not reduced, so the Race Director Anne Mallédant announced to cancel the race of the first day and postpone the race to the afternoon on October 1.
"The strong winds from the shore never seem to stop, and the state of the sea is so severe. "
Mallédant explained: "No one knows the time when the gust will blow to the racing boats as well as the scale of wind force.
Since the boat-sailing field is near the city, so far as it goes, the wisest choice is to cancel the race. "
The sailors still felt a little disappointed for everything was ready.
"The racing boats are ready, and we are in excellent condition. "
The helmsman of Qingdao Team Max Richardson said frankly: "But I know it is a right choice to change the race date. And I hope the wind will die down today, so that we can do some good. "
Micah Wilkinson, the "Hope Star" of New Zealand Team for 2020 Tokyo Olympiad, said: "Losing a day's time makes the race more interesting.
Because the race content will be increased today, and there will be only two days left for the race.
All of us will play hard. "
Though the sea wind blew violently, the helmsman of French ABM Team Pierre-Yves Durand told his warm memories with Qingdao at the pre-game meeting that he was accidentally injured in the Extreme Sailing Series 5 years ago, resulting in the muscular rupture, and fortunately, the local race medical team helped him deal with it so that he could stand here to take part in the race after 5 years.
It was learned that the Extreme Sailing Series started from 2007, and it was an ISAF game equivalent to the Volvo Ocean Race, the America's Cup and the World Match Racing Tour.
The hydrofoil catamaran of "FlyingPhantom" would be used in this race in Qingdao.
It is the 8th year of having this race in Qingdao, the "City of Sails". And it is the last race of this Series.
Although the turbulence in global financial markets continued, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the investment income of the Exchange Fund in the third quarter of this year fell by 97% annually, and it was better than that in the previous quarter, since overseas stocks rose and foreign exchange losses obviously narrowed under the China-U.S. trade war.
According to the latest data of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$1.6 billion from July to September 2018, significantly lower than HK$61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on the legislative session that at the beginning of the China-U.S. trade war, the share index in Hong Kong and emerging markets ran counter to the U.S. share index. By the end of September and early October, after the U.S. share index peaked in succession, the market sentiment began to reverse, since investors gradually realized that the trade war was also detrimental to the U.S. itself.
"It is good to have changes in the market sentiment. If the trade war only has unilateral effects, it doesn't help much for solving problems. "
He also pointed out that "if the trade war cannot be solved, the fluctuation of financial markets will continue to rise. "
In the third quarter of this year, the stock investment losses of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK$4.7 billion compared with the previous quarter, and the investment income of overseas stock increased by 17.2% to HK$12.8 billion; the foreign exchange losses was HK$16.2 billion and the bond yields was HK$9.7 billion, with a decrease of 24% and 31% respectively, mainly reflecting the general rise of the US dollar for exchange of major currencies in this quarter and the rise of the US coupon rate to above 3% in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund was mainly used for supporting Hong Kong dollars.
Hong Kong has implemented the linked exchange rate system for the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar since 1983.
As for the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that the uncertainty of the economic and asset markets increased and downside risks increased, but the financial system Hong Kong was robust, so that good defence were made and the earthquake-resistant capacity was abundant.
"The international investment position is abundant in Hong Kong, with a net external asset value of US$1.4 trillion, which is 4 times GDP, higher than 2.5 times in Singapore and 0.6 times in Japan. It is enough to cope with the financial downturns or reversal. "
The current daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to fall and the interest margin with US dollars expanded. Chen Delin pointed out that the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar rose more than 400 basis points on September 21. The markets generally believed that it was mainly related to the rise of the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars. And then the Hong Kong dollar hovered around 7.80-7.84 for exchange of the US dollar. Until recently, the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to fall, and the interest margin with US dollars expanded, which might attract more hedging activities to sell the Hong Kong dollar and buy the US dollar, triggering the opportunity of the exchange guarantee of the weak side again to increase compared with that of the previous period.
However, he believed that as the interest-rate rise cycle of the Hong Kong Bank began and the Hong Kong dollar interest rates were normalizing, the situation that Hong Kong dollar interest rates were lower than US dollar interest rates would change in the future.
"The trend of Hong Kong dollar interest rates and US dollar interest rates will be more consistent. Everyone must be more careful to manage risks and prepared to cope with market fluctuations. "
Since the funds of the Hong Kong dollar was abundant, the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars fell further. The three-month daily interest rates on private loan fell by 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, and the interest rate differential with the US dollar increased from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the one-month daily interest rates on private loan hit the bottom within five months, and the interest rate differential with the US dollar increased from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the spot rate of Hong Kong dollars was close to 7.85 with exchange of $1 most of the time.
During that time, due to factors of partial share offer gained outflows from Hong Kong dollars after the completion of interest arbitrage activities and large-scale share offer activities, causing that the exchange guarantee for the weak side was triggered for the first time in April, and for many times in May and August.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought Hong Kong dollars and sold Hong Kong dollars at the level of 7.85 according to the linked exchange rate system, in order to maintain the stability of the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought around HK$52.1 billion under the mechanism of exchange guarantee of the weak side from May to August.
Does foreigners can benefit from the new Individual Income Tax Law?
On 30th, the relevant person in charge from Ministry of Finance and State Administration of Taxation answered the reporters that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new Individual Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
Some reporters asked that the newly revised Individual Income Tax Law will adjust the criterion for resident taxpayers of China’s Individual Income Tax Law from one year to 183 days.
"May I ask if there are any preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, in implementing this new law?"
The principals responded that the current effective Individual Income Tax Law’s enforcement regulations have special preferential provisions for taxation issues for foreigners. For individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived for more than one year and less than five years and earn incomes from outside China, their part of the payment by domestic units or individuals is subject to individual income tax.
The principals said that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new Individual Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
The confinement center without "threshold": quality certification would promote the quality.
As the "two-child economic" develops and the maternal and child market thrives, various grades of confinement service centers appeared around China, from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to the 3rd and 4th tier cities.
The popular confinement service centers, which could satisfy the consumer's demands, charged from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan. However, they were in an awkward situation, because this kind of institution had no threshold at all, and there was still the There is still a blank zone in regulation.
Recently, the State Administration for Market Regulation carried out a series of activities of 2018 National "Quality Month". The reporter came to a five-star confinement center in Tianjin to explore the certification of maternal and child care services.
A common confinement center provided the services of newborn care, nutritious food, and postpartum reconstruction, etc.
The reporter found in this confinement center that the nurses would check the newborn breastfeeding each day, and the professional nursing workers would provide the newborns with the careful nursing services, such as bathing and touching.
In order to satisfy the new mother's demand, it would provide the wound care in the beginning of confinement, bodybuilding care in the middle and later periods of confinement, Chinese traditional cosmetic treatment and other nursing items to help the new mother restore her graceful figure.
A new mother there told the reporter that she had booked this confinement service center 8 months in advance.
The service items of confinement service center would directly impact the parturient's comfort and body recovery during the confinement. Some small confinement service centers could only provide some simple services during the confinement, but there were many problems and hidden troubles, including the irregular sterilization and sanitation, incidental cross infection, limited and unscientific diet, etc.
The responsible person of this confinement center said that they were the only one five-star confinement center in Tianjin, which had been certified as a Grade B service provider.
"Some customers didn't understand the meaning of the Grade B certification at first, but the fact forcing the enterprises to strictly implement the standardized process management through certification will benefit the customers. It is important for the long-term development of enterprises. " he said.
Pan Lifen, the deputy director of the Attestation Supervision Department of the State Administration for Market Regulation, said that the service certification was a new kind of certification system, which was based on the customers' perception and focused on the organizational quality management and satisfaction of service characteristics. It was an important part of the national quality infrastructure, and had a positive effects on increasing the proportion of quality services and enhancing China's international service competitiveness.
After more than 10 years of development since 2004, the service certification project in our country had gone through a process of developing from scratch. A series of influential service certification had appeared, including the financial service certification, mother and baby nursing service certification, after-sales service certification, electronic commerce service certification, and health care service certification.
According to the statistics of the State Administration for Market Regulation, there are more than 130 service certification institutions with over 2000 service certification staff and nearly 8000 valid authentication certificates at present in our country.
Pan Lifen said that it was necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually extend the coverage of service certification in the fields of health, education, sports, finance and electronic commerce, and boost the supply-side reform and quality enhancement in the service industry.
Report of Reuters on November 5 in Hong Kong: the property price in Hong Kong fell for two consecutive months after peaking. Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on Monday that it needed time to observe whether the property market had entered downturns. If confirmed, it can be considered to successively ease the tightening policy of counter-cyclical measures at an appropriate time.
Chen Delin also pointed out that if the property price fell, the first to be affected would be those who bought properties at the peak of the property market, but it was expected that there would be less opportunities to occur the situation like sharply falling property prices and the properties substantially sold by the citizens during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997.
When leading multiple senior leaders of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to attend the briefing session of the legislative session, Chen Delin said that if the property market was determined to enter downturns, the ease of measures can be made in succession at an appropriate time.
"However, since data of a few weeks only can currently be seen, it's still too early to ease, and it needs more time to see whether the property market is entering downturns. "
Since October 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has successively launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to substantially tighten the mortgages of various properties, including reduction of the number of mortgages, and that the mortgage applicants have to pass rigorous stress tests, in order to improve the bank risk management and shock resistance.
As Hong Kong formally entered the interest-rate rise cycle, the house price index of private houses in Hong Kong peaked for two consecutive months in August and September and then fell, and the monthly decline in September even expanded to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year was still 10.2%.
According to the data of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the household financial conditions for the ability of Hong Kong to withstand financial risks were measured to be healthy. In the second quarter this year, the percentage of households of self-occupation non-mortgage residence in Hong Kong was 66%, which was higher than the average of 60% in 2009-2011; the average loan-to-value ratio of the newly approved mortgage and the percentage of contribution and income of the newly approved mortgage was 47% and 34% respectively, with obvious improvement compared with 64% and 41% in 2009-2011.
However, Chen Delin said that high shock resistance didn’t mean the citizens who had bought properties wouldn’t be suffered damage of financial downturns, since the property valuation would fall, and those who bought properties at peak times would be the first to be affected.
Although the Hong Kong Monetary Authority tightened the lending of the bank to the mortgage borrowers, those who bought properties can also get a high-percentage mortgage loan by means of the mortgage insurance, the mortgage loan provided by the developer and so on.
Chen Delin said that currently together with the mortgage loan provided by the developer, the mortgage percentage of the borrower can reach 85-90%. If the property price fell by 10%, there would be negative assets (i.e. the market value of the property fell below the level of the total outstanding mortgage loan).
However, Ruan Guoheng, the vice president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority pointed out that the Authority estimated the total high-percentage mortgage loan provided by the developer to account for 2-2.5% of the total mortgage of the bank, with lower proportion.
At the peak time of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, with proportion of 22% in those who took mortgage.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative asset for seven consecutive quarters.

ECNS, Shenzhen, October 1 (reported by Zheng Xiaohong, Xu Dianwei & Liu Shumeng) -- It was the first day of the National Day "Golden Week" in the mainland on October 1. And it was also the last day of the National Day public holiday in Hong Kong. Many mainland residents used this holiday to travel and go shopping across the border, while many Hong Kong residents returned to Hong Kong after visiting Shenzhen. The passenger volume of Shenzhen ports was "full to bursting", and the ports in Luohu and Shenzhen Bay had newly opened 22 automated gateways. This would improve the clearance efficiency in ports and facilitate the passengers to be cleared by the customs effectively and rapidly.
According to the data provided by Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection, over 4290000 people and over 168000 vehicles had been transported across the boarder by 16:00 that afternoon. The ports had always been busy and orderly with a good order of entry and exit.
It was learned that there were an increasing number of passengers taking advantage of the National Day holiday to visit the countries in Europe and Southeast Asia to go shopping affected by many positive factors, such as there were more countries providing the visa-free policy for the Chinese citizens.
The passenger (car) flow peak in the exit direction in the ports in Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Huanggang, and Futian occurred in the morning of October 1. The passenger flow peak in Luohu port lasted from 9:00 am to 11:00 am, and the passenger (car) flow peak in Shenzhen Bay port lasted from 6:30 am to the noon at 13:00.
According to the introduction, in order to cope with passenger (car) flow peak across the boarder, Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection followed the unified deployment of the State Immigration Administration to start the service mode of passenger (car) flow peak period, arrange the policemen to work overtime to support those working in the front-line on duty, open enough passages for inspection and examination in advance, ensure that the queueing time of Chinese citizen's exit and entry would not exceed 30 minutes while taking into account of the foreigner's clearance efficiency; the order maintenance in the crowded was enhanced, and the customs clearance was ensured to be safe and orderly.
Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection also reminded the travelers across the boarder to pay attention to the expiry dates of their certificates, visas, and endorsements before their trips, make the travel arrangement in a reasonable way, try to avoid the passenger flow peak period and choose a right time and a right port to travel.
The passengers headed for Hong Kong via Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link must take their valid exit & entry documents, visas and endorsements. The high-speed rail ticket could be used as a proof of payment only, but not the exit and entry certificate. Anyone, who couldn't go to Hong Kong across the boarder due to the reasons such as the documents and procedures were not satisfiable, should follow the guide of the policeman on duty in the Frontier Inspection, and go to the designated site to wait for the staff of MTR corporation to guide them to go through the procedures of returning the mainland by train.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic and stubborn disease involving multiple organs of the body. It used to be considered as an "incurable disease".
Because its pathogenesis is unknown, diagnosis and treatment are difficult, and there is lack of effective treatment, it is hard to cure once and for all.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, and Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatism and Immunity Center at Peking University People’s Hospital, together with their teams discovered the existence of human immune globulin can increase the molecular variation of systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility, and this kind of variation is involved in the regulation of immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors and member of Peking University People’s Hospital, the team of Li Zhanguo collected nearly 2,000 large samples of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus to make study. It was found that patients with immune globulin variations produced pathopoiesis cells and a wide variety of numerous autoantibodies. The incidence and severity of nephritis, arthritis, orrhomeningitis vasculitis and other inflammations are significantly increased.
Through various research methods such as immune cell tracing, animal testing, and sequencing, Liu Wanli team found that the immune molecule variation activates the immune signaling pathway and the pathogenic mechanism of promoting B cells secreting various autoantibodies.
The reporter learned that the powerful combination between two teams gave full play to their respective advantages and achieved a close integration between basic research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli team is committed to B lymphocyte immune recognition and immune activation research, and the Li Zhanguo team has long been engaged in clinical research on systemic lupus erythematosus.
"This research is one of the results of years of cooperation between the two teams. It is also the first time in the academic community to recognize that immune globulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, which lays a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted therapy. "
This is not shield mistakes, but acting by law.
Lawyers took an axe to the court?
The news was really exciting at first glance, and it also caused a great disturbance in the legal circle.
Fujian Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court subsequently fined the lawyers for 500 yuan and proposed in writing to the Quanzhou Lawyers Association to investigate and handle.
According to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association issued a formal notice that the behaviors of the two lawyers did not involve violations of laws and regulations and were not punished according to law.
According to the multi-party reports, the handling of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is not a shortcomings protection or confrontation, but has been approved by the Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court.
An event that could have caused tension within the legal community was eventually resolved properly.
The reversal of the event stems from the more completed truth restoring: the axe carried by the lawyer involved is the same type and same model as the defendant’s weapon, but it is not put the first edge. It only serves as secondary evidence in the evidence-proven and cross-examination link, and there is no threatening acts or the subject intention of "endangering the court security".
Judging whether the behaviors of the lawyers involved is illegal or not, there are four very important details to be concerned. First, the local court has twice held the court and only showed a photo of the axe. From the perspective of defense, it is necessary to show the original axe. Second, the axe is purchased one hour before the court open. It is not that the lawyer is not willing to seek the judge’s consent, but it is not able to contact the judge objectively. Third, the axe has not been used in an excessive or improper manner. Fourth, the lawyers admitted the mistake in public and immediately apologized to the court.
Based on these plots, it can be seen that the lawyers who "took axe to appear in court" have nothing to do the devil things, but just to make defense.
After clarifying the whole facts, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association did not follow the societal discussion, but resisted the pressure and made a decision not to impose penalties.
And this decision can withstand the test of facts and laws.
As taking the axe as the controlled knife to the court without the permission of the court, it is easy to cause anxiety and misunderstanding.
For the sake of safety and cautious, Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court’s previous fine punishment and judicial advice are also understandable.
In order to maintain the dignity of lawyers and prevent several courts from finding excuses to purposely make difficulties for lawyers, the Supreme Law promulgated the "Rules on Security Checks by Judicial Policemen of the People’s Courts" in 2014, establishing the principles that lawyers do not need to conduct personal security check in court.
Since the issuance of the Rule, lawyers have set examples, and there have been few incidents endangering the court security happened due to the omissions of security checks.
In such a very rare case happened in Quanzhou, as long as we communicate in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding, misunderstanding is not difficult to eliminate.
As a self-regulatory organization in the lawyer profession, the Lawyers Association bears the dual mission of disciplining against law and safeguard the legitimate rights.
In the past, individual Lawyers Association organizations have been blamed for their emphasis on disciplinary action and their loss of safeguard.
The decision of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is worthy of praise both in terms of process and results, and it sets an example for more lawyers association to perform their duties correctly.

The taxpayer receiving the job salaries after October 1 can have the basic deduction of fees deducted based on the threshold of 5000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate schedule will be applied. Most of the taxpayers will enjoy different levels of tax reduction, especially the lower and middle-income people, who will see more significant tax reduction.
According to the tax reduction fact sheet of different income groups, for the people whose monthly income will be 8000 yuan, 10000 yuan, 20000 yuan, and 50000 yuan after deducting the "three insurances and one fund", the taxable amounts after the tax reform will be 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan, and 9090 yuan respectively. Compared with the monthly threshold of 3500 yuan, the corresponding tax reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, 18.8% respectively.
It is worth noting that due to holidays, the new basic deduction of fees and tax rate schedule can be applied to the salaries that should be paid by the units in October but have been paid at the end of September according to laws.
For this purpose, the withholding client software, which is uniformly promoted and used by the tax department, has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid during the statutory declaration period.
The second benefit: the gaps between grades of low tax rates will be obviously widened.
In addition to raising the threshold, the new tax rate schedule will be applied from October 1.
This time, seven grades of tax rates of job salaries are the same as before without any changes, but the gaps between grades of tax rates are obviously changed. The gaps between three grades of low tax rates in 3%, 10% and 20% are obviously widened, the gap of the grade of tax rate in 25% is slightly narrowed, but the gaps between three grades of high tax rates in 30%, 35% and 45% are the same as before.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the grades of tax rates for income from production and business operation, and the lower limit of the highest grade of tax rate in 35% has been increased from 0.1 million yuan to 0.5 million yuan.
This means that the individual businesses and personal exclusive investment enterprises will benefit from this tax reform.
"From the perspective of measurement and calculation of personal tax reduction for Shanghai taxpayers in the earlier stage, the broad masses of taxpayers will fully experience the benefits of the personal income tax reform, especially the lower and middle-income people, who will see more significant tax reduction. "
Lan Min, the head of Personal Income Tax Division of Shanghai Tax Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation, said.
The third benefit: the tax service will become more convenient and optimized.
Shanghai tax departments have carried out a series of comprehensive activities of tax propaganda since the announcement of the new personal income tax law.
On the one hand, they provided the policy guidance on "one-to-one & point-to-point" for the important tax sources and important enterprises.
Pudong New Area Tax Bureau has visited Apple Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Alipay (China) Network Technology Co., Ltd., Red Star Macalline Group Corporation Ltd. and other large enterprises successively. These enterprises have a large number of employees and a large amount of works in withholding and remitting tax, so the tax department actively provided coaching and answered questions; Xuhui District Tax Bureau has visited some large labor service enterprises, including CIIC Financial Consulting Ltd. and CIIC Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Ltd. within the district. It collected their concerned problems, responded to their appeals, and resolved their difficulties in a timely way.
On the other hand, they implemented the "comprehensive, multidimensional and stereoscopic" tax policy promotion for the citizen taxpayers.
They used Shanhai Tax official website, WeChat official account, MicroBlog and other resources to post the hot topics and ensured that the policy announcements were in place.
At the same time, Shanghai Tax WeChat official account has put the 12366 Intelligent Consulting Platform since September 28. It would carry out the "targeted" integrated intelligent services of personal income tax reform via the "Human+Intelligence" tax service consultation.

The United States, Canada and Mexico have concluded a trilateral trade agreement, and it will bring new opportunities to 500 million people.
According to foreign media reports, the joint statement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada Freeland and the United States Trade Representative Lighthizer, which was published on the Canadian government website, indicated that the United States, Canada and Mexico had reached a trilateral trade agreement, which was called "USMCA" (The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement).

The result of the Election of Okinawa Governor, which was conducted ahead of schedule because the former governor Onaga Takeshi had died of illness, was announced on October 1 local time. Denny Tamaki, who opposed the plan of relocating the US military base in Japan, was elected successfully.
This election was voted on September 30. The final result showed that Tamaki had 396632 votes, which was the most votes made in the history of the Election of Okinawa Governor. He had over 80000 more votes than his major opponent Atsushi Sakima.
A total of 4 candidates participated in this election, and the voting rate was 63.24%, which was 0.89% lower than that of the Election of Okinawa Governor in 2014.
Tamaki told the media on October 1 that the result of election showed that the Okinawa people didn't want to waste the former governor Onaga Takeshi's efforts during his lifetime, and he would carry out Takeshi's behests to make continued efforts in opposing the plan of relocating the US military base and the closure of the Futenma base to the Japanese government and the American government.
The Futenma base is located in Ginowan in Okinawa Prefecture, and it has been criticized all the time. The Japanese government and the American government have agreed to relocate it to Henoko in Nago, but the Okinawa people strongly oppose this action and hope to move the base completely out of Okinawa.
For the relocation plan strongly opposed by Okinawa people and the request to cancel the permit for land reclamation along the coast of Henoko, Tamaki said that he didn't stand on the opposite and divisive ground against the central government at the beginning. He hoped that both sides could fully exchange views, show the intention to solve the problems through negotiation.
Japanese President Shinzo Abe also told the media in the morning of October 1 that he would seriously accept this result and make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden on the base.
Yoshihide Suga, the Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan, said in the press conference on October 1 that the government's policy of relocating the US base as soon as possible had not been changed at all.
And he also expressed his intention to talk with Tamaki.
Tamaki will officially take up his duties as the governor of Okinawa.
Since the mid-2000s, with China’s increasing needs for oilseeds, Paul Thomas, a farmer in North Dakota, has grown more and more soybeans in his field.
This transition reaches the peak this year. He has grown 1,600 acres of soybeans in the 5,000-acre land, reaching an unprecedented scale
However, in 2019, Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch production to the staple crops in the former U.S. agricultural region, such as corn and wheat.
The area of soybeans grown by American farmers exceeds that of corn this year, which is for the first time in 35 years.
The reason why the farmers plan to switch production to other crops is that American farmers face difficulties in selling soybeans in the context of the trade war launched by President Trump against China.
China usually purchases around 60% of soybeans exported from America, but because of the trade war, the purchases of American soybeans are nearly zero in recent months, leading to a 10-year low in soybean prices.
Thomas plans to grow more wheats next year and hopes to earn more by reducing dependence on crops that rely on Chinese demands.
Thomas said that the soybean price "brings us a heavy blow".
He said that the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per bushel without Chinese demands, while the price needed for covering costs was $8.50.
The area of soybeans grown by American farmers hits a high record and the harvest is expected to hit a high record.
At such a vulnerable time, they are hit by the trade war.
As Trump imposed tariffs on the goods imported from China, China imposes tariffs on the soybeans imported from America in July.
The United States Department of Agriculture will release the first estimated report of cultivated area next year, which is expected to include consideration of tariff effects.
This estimate is expected to confirm the expectations of non-governmental organizations that the cultivated area of soybeans will be reduced.
According to a report seen by Reuters, on October 19, Informa Economics predicted that the cultivated area of corns would increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) and the cultivated area of soybeans would decrease by 7% to 83 million acres in 2019.
Informa also predicted that the cultivated area of wheats in America would increase by 4%.
The cultivated area of soybeans increases to 89.6 million acres this year before retaliatory tariffs are implemented, which is about 15 million acres higher than that of 10 years ago.
The cultivated area of corns has increased by less than 5 million acres to 89.1 million acres since 2008. The cultivated area of wheats is 47.8 million acres this year, which is close to the lowest level in 100 years.
The total cultivated area of the president of Illinois Corn Growers Association Aron Carlson’s family is 3,600 acres. He uses nearly half of the land to grow soybeans, but he plans to make reduction in the future.
He said that the cultivated area of corns in the farm in North Illinois would increase by 20% at most; this state is the largest soybean cultivation state in America.
The yields per acre of soybeans are lower than that of corns, but less fertilizer is needed, which makes the cost of soybean cultivation relatively low as a whole.
If farmers switch production to corns, the cost may increase. But the fertilizer seller of Andersons Inc and other enterprises may benefit from it.
Pat Bowe, the CEO of Andersons said to Reuters that he predicted that switching production to corns would be beneficial to fertilizer use.
Bayer also predicts to benefit from farmers switching production to corns.

The fifth "Month of vocalization for the disabled" comes; focus on the issue of sex education for disabled teenagers - China News
In recent years, the topic of sex education for Chinese teenagers has been widely discussed, but the challenge for sex education for disabled teenagers is still arduous.
Recently, the seminar on challenges and practical strategies of comprehensive sex education for the disabled was held in Beijing.
It is an major issue about how to carry out sex education for disabled children and young people in this seminar.
"The report of sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of Chinese disabled children and young people" released at the meeting reveals that the proportion of disabled children subjected to sexual harassment and abuse is higher than that of healthy children.
For disabled children and teenagers, what the society focuses on is the attention of "sexual protection".
This seminar aims at promoting the comprehensive sex education for disabled children and teenagers in China from three aspects of family support, school education and institution services, providing support to the disabled children and teenagers from the source, thus letting them enjoy the right of love as others do.
Experts believe that the Chinese public understanding of disabled groups has remained at a level that is not deep enough for a long time.
Being influenced by the traditional concept and other factors, the comprehensive sex education for the disabled, especially for the disabled children and teenagers in China, is not deep enough.
However, in recent years, with the support of the UNESCO and public-spirited people, the practice and implementation path of full-cycle comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education for the disabled in China have made gratifying progress.
"The report" shows that the children and young people with visual impairment, hearing impairment, intellectual impairment and physical impairment have more difficulties in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding intimate relationship than the ordinary people, but they have generally developed towards convenience and enrichment.
"The seminar on challenges and practical strategies of comprehensive sex education for the disabled" is held by the Shanghai Youren Public Welfare Foundation and supported by the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the Beijing Representative Office of the International League for Disabled Persons (France) and the UNFPA Representative Office in China. Its purpose is to explore the practice and implementation path of full-cycle comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education for the disabled in the context of grand strategy of healthy China, and promote the interested parties of policy makers, educators, researchers, social service organizations and parents’ representatives in the field of special education and integrated education to understand the international policy on comprehensive sexual education and the right to health of disabled children and young people; the practices, strategies, challenges and resources of sex education for disabled children and young people in China are widely exchanged, and the way of comprehensive sex education for disabled children and young people in the future is discussed and a blueprint is set up to form a support network.
Report of the Reuters on September 30 in Beijing - People's Bank Of China released its predetermined short-term net outflow of foreign currency assets on Sunday and showed as of the end of August this year, its short positions in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies remained zero for 12 consecutive months, and there were still no long position in that month.
Previous data from the People's Bank Of China showed that as of the end of August last year, the it had a total short position of $6.044 billion in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the short position in SDR (Special Drawing Rights) was 4.276 billion SDR.
Since then, the foreign exchange forwards short position of the People's Bank Of China remained zero.
People's Bank Of China released the data for the first time at the end of March 2016; the data showed that at the end of February 2016, its long positions in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies was US$2.438 billion and short positions was US$28.9 billion.
The data in September released at the end of October of the same year showed a net short position increase of $16.401 billion to $45.301 billion for the first time.
People's Bank Of China has previously said that the forward and futures short positions of foreign currencies vs local currencies mainly reflected the forward operations of foreign exchange carried out by the People's Bank Of China with commercial banks with the purpose of meeting the hedging needs of enterprises' foreign currency liabilities. It would continue to provide forward hedging products according to the principle of actual demand, and the forward operations of the People's Bank Of China would have minor impact on the scale of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, student Qiao, who was a junior in Zhengzhou, took the train to Hebi.
An elder uncle on the train bought a ticket without seat, but he took up her seat, and said: "you can take photos, whatever".
During the two hours of driving, the train conductor advised him for an hour, however it still had no results.
In the end, a male passenger in the same carriage could not stand up and pulled up the elder uncle.
From the public opinion, although the final result is mostly that the persons who forcibly occupy seats are condemned by the public, administratively punished by the public security department, and even included in the blacklist of integrity, the public still feels that it does not "vent their hates": Why can’t the persons who forcibly occupy seats be punished on the spot?
Why can’t stop immoral or even illegal behavior on the spot, but can only punish it afterwards?
And for the unreasonable behavior of "the elder uncle who forcibly occupy seats", why only a male passenger pull him up because of "Road see injustice"?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with railway policemen, and there is generally no railway policemen for short-distance trains; even if there is railway policemen, the passengers are more concerned about the possible rogue reactions of the persons who forcibly occupy seats and do not take compulsory taking away measures.
Repeated seats forcibly occupied events have made people realize that it is necessary to let the persons who forcibly occupy seats be forced to take away or even be punished on the spot.
This requires that our railway policemen should dare to take powerful measures in a timely manner. Trains that do not have policemen should make deployment as soon as possible to preserve and prevent illegal activities in a timely manner.
It is the first day of the National Day holiday in October 1. There is a surge in the vehicles heading for Mao County and Songpan County via Beichuan Qiang Minority Autonomous County in Sichuan.
Beichuan Traffic Police received a call for help at about 13:00 saying that a family member had a traffic accident in Songpan and was badly in need of being sent to Mianyang for treatment due to the limited local medical conditions.
However, the Huanhu Road of Tangjiashan quake lake in Beichuan was under one-way traffic control, so the caller hoped the traffic police would permit the 120 emergency ambulance to pass though the road.
After getting the call for help, the policeman on duty quickly reported this to the traffic police group. After understanding the general situation, the group leader Huang Xuemin immediately arranged the policemen on duty at the controlled site to contact with the help seeker and asked them to do the escort job well.
"There were more than 1000 vehicles having entered the controlled road segment at that time. After contacting with the 120 emergency ambulance, we estimated that it would arrive at Beichuan at about 15:00, so we implemented the arrangement and deployment immediately. "
The leader of Yuli Squadron of Beichuan Traffic Police Da Wei introduced that the emergency ambulance needed to bypass the Huanhu Road of Tangjiashan quake lake, and the road was steep and narrow. In order to prevent the vehicles in the road segment from running side by side, the traffic police implemented the subsection control of vehicles in the beginning, the middle and the end of the road an hour in advance and reminded all drivers passing through it to make a way for the emergency ambulance.
Later, the policemen of Leigu Squadron also stopped the vehicles entering the controlled road segment temporarily, and asked the vehicles to form a line to make a way for the incoming 120 emergency ambulance.
An emergency ambulance with a "Chuan U" license plate was driving into Beichuan at about 15:00, and Beichuan Traffic Police sent a police car to clear the way and escort the emergency ambulance into the controlled road segment by driving against the traffic.
It was learned that some places on Huanhu Road only permitted one vehicle passing through, and the police implemented the temporary control at these places so that the 120 emergency ambulance could successfully pass through.
It was impossible to give way in a road segment in Shilibei Village in Daxuanping Town, so the traffic police got in touch with the village party branch and village committee in advance to use the village road for bypassing and stop the social vehicles from entering.
"It only took 40 minutes from Beichuan Traffic Police met the 120 emergency ambulance to drive into the normal road of the 302 provincial highway. "
Da Wei explained that the overall passing time needed to be 4 hours under normal circumstances.
"This arrangement has successfully saved precious treatment time for the patient. "
It was learned that the critically ill patient was timely sent to Mianyang for treatment at 17:20.

Two suspected pickpockets were caught when they were picking pockets on No. 20 bus from Yongding Gate Station to Zhushikou Station at 8:05 yesterday morning.
These two male pickpockets cut the passenger's coat pocket, and stole 800 yuan cash from it. However, they were caught red-handed by the policemen, who had already waited nearby.
This is the first pickpocket case cracked by Beijing police during the National Day holiday.
The anti-pickpocket investigators of Beijing Police Mobile Investigation Corps arrived at the designated position at about 5:00 yesterday morning.
According to the previous experience, the places with massive human traffic, including the public transit hubs, bus and subway lines, and even the crowd watching the flag-raising ceremony in Tiananmen Square, are the key areas in their work.
In the crowd, the plainclothes policemen were calmly observing the people passing by.
The investigators, who were waiting at the bus station, found two suspicious man following a man to get on No. 20 bus from Yongding Gate Station at about 7:00.
On the bus, the two men standing on the left and right of the male passenger, and one of them tried to provide cover for the other.
But they didn't know that the plainclothes policemen standing by were paying close attention to their every movement.
"Catch the thief with the stolen goods". It was very critical for the plainclothes policemen to choose the timing of catching the thief. While waiting for the men to steal, the policemen had to keep their eyes on them, who were preparing for the pickpocket. As soon as they succeeded in pickpocket, the investigators caught them at one stroke.
The reporter of Beijing Morning Post learned that the policemen ferreted out 800 yuan cash from the suspected pickpockets.
"They took the money from the passenger's coat pocket. "
The policeman pointed to a broken coat pocket and said: "They cut it here, and stole 800 yuan cash from a Beijing tourist. When we caught them, they had just put the money into their pocket. "
The reporter learned that the plainclothes policemen had followed the suspected pickpockets for an hour in order to catch them. Finally, they caught them at one stroke when they were committing a crime.
Currently, the two criminal suspects were under the police's examination.
The plainclothes policeman told the reporter that it was easy for the policeman to recognize the suspects in the crowd.
"You will find out that the thieves' eyes and expressions were different from the ordinary passengers' when you have caught a number of thieves. In addition to staring at other people's pockets and backpacks, they also like to get into the crowd instead of avoiding the crowd. "
The policeman also told the reporter that the suspects were often purposeless while waiting for the bus. They liked to wander at the bus station and would follow the target to get on a bus.
"These are the voices of experience. If you have worked as a plainclothes policeman for a long time enough, you will know it quite sensibly. "
Furthermore, the policeman also reminded: "It is the most convenient to put things in the coat pocket, but it will be the easiest to be stolen. "
Mind your own property when you are traveling outside and taking a bus to avoid being stolen.

For activating rural consumption, it is necessary to rely on the normalization mechanism to purify the market, guide the demand for healthy consumption, and enhance the sense of gain in farmers’ consumption.
According to data, the consumption potentiality of rural residents has been continuously released. In the first half of this year, the retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5%, and the growth rate is 1.3 percentage points higher than that of towns.
During the visit to a poor village in a western county, there is only one convenience store in the whole village. Stepping into the store, some items are the brands we familiar with, however there are lots of fake good, such as "金龙鱼" is labeled as "金龙油" and "旺仔" labeled as "旺奶".
Over the years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed. Some rural fake and inferior products imitate famous brands, they have similar names and packages to mix the false with the genuine, which is really hard to prevent.
A consumer survey report released by a city in the west shows that rural shopping malls and supermarkets have a serious problem of fake products, and 66% of users have bought fakes in supermarkets in villages and towns offline, of which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant departments claim to rectify the rural markets every year, while, why the phenomena of fake products still occur repeatedly?
Different from the urban markets, farmers’ awareness of rights protection is relatively weak, and many villages are in remote locations within the blind areas of inspection force can’t reach, so that the fake and inferior goods have a breeding ground.
One product has more than one regulatory departments, some are responsible for price, some are for production, and others are for markets, so the functions are overlapped. Strong measures against fake and inferior products have been taken every year, however the central management can only last for a period of time. On one hand, the fakes escape the crack down trend and slowly emerged, on the other hand, the previous fakes just have been dealt and the new fake came out.
Some unscrupulous traders have initiated the idea of "going to the mountainous areas and the countryside" and some rural areas become the "waste elimination markets", both of these problems are because of long-term supervision mechanism, difficulties in purifying rural markets, low illegal cost and higher profit.
From food and clothing to well-off, the majority of farmers are moving towards development type consumption.
A few days ago, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Some Opinions concerning Stimulating the Consumption Mechanism to Further Encourage the Consumption Potential of Residents", which proposed to promote the level upgrading of the consumption of rural residents. The purpose is to make the majority of farmers to "have ability to consume", "have willing to consume" and "dare to consume" to let the rural consumption really flourish.
On the one hand, we must deepen reforms, eliminate drawbacks of market management policies coming from multiple departments and regulate by more than one departments. According to local conditions, improve the food safety, product quality supervision network, and constantly reduce the space for rural fake products manufacturing and selling.
On the other hand, it is necessary to intensify law enforcement and open up the supervision of each department, and never allow the fake and inferior commodities to breed in the countryside.
It is the protection for farmers to severely punish the behavior of entrapping farmers. No matter how concealed the counterfeiters hide, it should not be the reason for the breeding of the fake and inferior commodities. Relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, and the grassroots supervisory powers should go down. If there is a problem in any part, it is necessary to investigate the responsibility and let the counterfeiters and selling persons have nowhere to hide.
Strictly control the market access, implement strict qualification examinations for production operators. Keep the market circulation, let the products have clear sources and outlet markets. Think of ways from the source and the roots, let the legal dealers operate with peace of mind, and let the farmers buy with confidence.
Activate rural consumption, guide the demand for healthy consumption.
As consumption upgrading, many farmers not only pursue of well fed and eat well, but also go after for high quality life with culture and healthy. Thus, rural markets are not equal to "low quality" and "low price".
This needs to promote the extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, connect the urban and rural two-way linkage sales channels, promote the combination of offline industry development platform and online e-commerce trading platform, support the new forms and new modes of consumption to expand into the rural market; promote qualified villages and towns to combine trade logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, and product processing dynamically; improve the rural modern circulation network system, optimize the integration of stock facilities resources, and effectively reduce rural circulation costs.
Create a clear and reassuring market environment for the rural areas, so that farmers can afford to buy, so that the rural consumption can become more and more prosperous and the farmers’ senses of gain and happiness can be enhanced.
Our country will reduce the MFN tariff rate for some goods from November 1, and the general tariff level will be reduced to 7.5%.
According to the decision of the 26th executive meeting of the State Council, the Tariff Commission of the State Council announced on September 30 that the MFN tariff rate for some goods would be reduced from November 1, 2018.
According to the "Tariff Commission of the State Council's Announcement on Reducing the Import Tariff for Some Goods", the MFN tariff rate for some goods, including the industrial goods, would be reduced from November 1, 2018 in order to adapt to the industrial upgrading, reduce the enterprise costs, and satisfy people's demands of multilevel consumption.
There were 1585 taxable items in total for the tax reduction goods, which accounted for about 19% of total taxable items in our country. The average tax rate was reduced from 10.5% to 7.8% by an average of 26%.
This tax reduction mainly involved the textiles; stones, ceramics, glass products; some steel and base metal products; electromechanical devices and parts, such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, electric transmission and transformation equipment, electrical appliances, instruments and apparatus, etc.; resource goods and primary processed goods, such as non-metal ores, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, gemstone and jade, etc.
Meanwhile, with the reduction of general tariff level, especially the import tariff reduction of medicine and consumer goods, the taxable items and tax rate for import tax on imported goods would be reduced accordingly.
In order to implement the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, our country had implemented the zero tariff on most imported drugs since May 1 this year, had reduced the import tariff for automobiles and parts and some consumer goods since July 1, and had implemented the third step of tax reduction for products in the extended scope of Information Technology Agreement.
The reporter learned from the Tariff Commission of the State Council that the general tariff level in our country was reduced from 9.8% of the previous year to 7.5%, by an average of 23% after several continuous independent adjustments.
Proper tariff reduction would be beneficial to accelerating the balanced development of foreign trade, promoting the higher-level opening to the outside world, overall planning and using the international and domestic resources, and boosting the domestic supply-side structural reform.
The relevant responsible person of the Commission said that this year was the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening-up. Taking the initiative to reduce the general tariff level was the practical action of implementing the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Boao Forum for Asia, and our country's important measure of further opening up and actively expanding imports based on our demand for high-quality development. These action and measure showed that China would unswervingly pursue the mutually beneficial opening-up strategy, strengthen the motive of self-development, and deliver benefits to the world through its development.
On September 29th, the regional public brand launch event for the "Huanxiangren" agricultural products of Huan County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District, Tianjin.

"Create a regional brand of "Huanxiangren" has effectively solved the development bottleneck of agricultural products in the Huan County, which is ‘more but not centralized, small and weak’, and it has become a powerful carrier for poverty alleviation." On September 29th, the regional public brand launch event for the "Huanxiangren" agricultural products hosted by Huan County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District, Tianjin.
Huan County is located at the junction of the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia. It is known as the "National Grain Production Advanced County", "China’s Minor Grain Crops Township" and "China’s Shadow Puppets Township". It has a long history and rich resources.
Local snacks such as lamb meat, yellow millet wine, buckwheat noodles, and oat noodles are the flavors that people often think of when they are away from their hometown.
As the level of urbanization in China continues to increase, the urban population has increased rapidly, and a large number of rural young people have left their hometowns to start urban life.
Yang Qiaojia, an expert on agricultural brand research in China, said: "Currently, urban life is fast-paced and stressful. More and more people are beginning to miss their rural life when they were young. However, ‘the place that cannot go back is the hometown, and the most beautiful memory is from the country’, the brand design of ‘Huanxiangren’ is named after the provincialism and homesickness of the wandering people of Huanhuan County. "
The climate conditions in Huan County are special, the sunshine time is long, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the conditions for planting special minor grain crops are richly endowed by nature.
There are more than 20 kinds of minor grain crops in the county. It is the hometown of China’s minor grain crops, and its output ranks first in Gansu, and its quality is front ranked in the country.
Wang Xiaoli is a Huan County girl who went to school in Tianjin. She participated in the promotion meeting as a volunteer. She said: "The people in my hometown are the most dear people, and the taste of the hometown is the most beautiful. The brand of ‘Huanxiangren’ has evoked too many homesickness and memories. What I have never forgotten is the food at childhood. I hope that the brand of ‘Huanxiangren’ will go further and further and become bigger and bigger. "
Dr. Tan Bin, a researcher at the Academy for National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration, said that through the detection of more than 900 sets of indicators, the detection data of agricultural products such as buckwheat, tartary buckwheat and black beans in Huanxian County are outstanding, and many physiological activators in miscellaneous grains are high. "Huanxiangren" has the inherent advantage of seizing the domestic high-end miscellaneous grains market.
Chai Chun, secretary of the County Committee of the Huan County, said that through the publish of the "Huanxiangren" brand, it can further improve the quality, standardization and scale of innovation and development of quality agricultural products in Huan County, which is conducive to shaping the good overall image of agricultural products in Huan County and rapidly increasing its popularity, competitiveness and added value.
The gross domestic product (GDP) of Canada grew by 0.2% in July compared with the previous month, with a higher-than-expected growing rate, raising market expectations that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If it does, it will be the fifth time in a bit more than a year that the bank raises interest rates.
The analysts of Reuters who made an interview previously forecasted a 0.1% increase.
The Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 of the 20 industries had achieved growth.
The data is noteworthy for the reason that the Bank of Canada predicted earlier this month that temporary factors could drag down the third-quarter GDP data.
Poloz, the president of the Bank of Canada, promised on Thursday that the bank would continue to gradually raise interest rates and pay close attention to the economic data.
The Bank of Canada will announce its next interest rate decision on October 24.
The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017 as the Canadian economy has strengthened and the unemployment rate is close to record lows.
Stephen Brown, the senior Canadian economist at Capital Economics, said that the country's third-quarter GDP was expected to grow at an annualized rate of around 2%.
"This will be 1.5% higher than the expectation of the Bank of Canada, which will be another reason to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month," he said in a report.
Overnight index swaps show that the market forecasts for probability of risings of interest rate of the Bank of Canada in October rise from 76.46% to 78.27%.
North Korea and South Korea jointly inspected the entrance of Han River for the first time over the past 65 years
On Day 5, the South Korea Defense Ministry confirmed that on the same day, North Korea and South Korea launched joint inspection in the water area of the entrance of Han River and Imjin River.
This action is early-stage preparations to ensure the free navigation of civilian vessels for both sides.
The notification provided by the South Korea Defense Ministry to the media on the same day showed that this was the first joint inspection of the entrance of Han River for both sides since the signing of the Korean War Armistice Agreement in 1953.
North Korea and South Korea signed a military agreement in September, and agreed to jointly inspect the entrance of Han River and other water areas from November, in order to ensure the environmental protection, tourism development and other aspects in such water areas in the future.
In October, North Korea and South Korea planned a joint inspection of the water areas during a general-level meeting.
On November 5, the joint inspection of the water areas of North Korea and South Korea was officially launched.
The joint inspection delegation consisted of 20 military personnel and experts from North Korea and South Korea.
According to the introduction of the South Korea Defense Ministry, during this inspection, personnel from both sides didn’t carry arms and were forbidden to use the words and deeds that could irritate the other side.
"Since there is no military demarcation line near the entrance, this area was once an accident-prone region. But through joint inspection, it will become a new peaceful area in the future. "
The total length of the water areas which were jointly inspected by North Korea and South Korea was about 70 km and the total area was about 280 square kilometers.
The South Korea Defense Ministry said that South Korea would send six inspection vessels to explore the depth of the sea water to provide basic information for the safe navigation in such water areas; after the investigation was completed, navigation maps would be provided for civilian vessels.
In October 2007, North Korea and South Korea held a summit talk in Pyongyang and reached an agreement on the joint use of the entrance of Han River and Imjin River, while subsequent negotiations deadlocked due to tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed by South Korea and North Korea in September, vessels of both sides only need to inform the other side in advance before sailing in common waters in the future.
Report on November 5 of China News: the website of the Chinese embassy in Mongolia reported on November 5 that Chinese citizens Guo Yuqin and Mao Runxin had been missing when traveling in Mongolia, .
It was understood that these two people were members of the Blue Sky Rescue team. On October 19, they contacted their relatives and friends in China and said they would immediately explore the mountains near the Khovsgol Lake. They shared their location via WeChat and then went missing. It was suspected that they had headed for the no man's land.
The Chinese embassy in Mongolia always paid high attention to the protection of the lawful rights and interests and safety of Chinese citizens in Mongolia, as well as the consular protection and assistance.
After being informed of the information about the two tourists going missing, the embassy immediately activated the contingency plan for consular protection, strived to seize the prime time for rescue and spared no efforts to work.
The embassy maintained close communication with the two tourists' families, assisted them in immediately reporting the case to the Mongolian police, and provided them with a list of interpreters for their choice.
The embassy made an appointment with the heads of the Mongolian Foreign Relations Department, the General Bureau of Police and the General Bureau of Emergency at first time to report relevant information. The embassy requested the Mongolian side to carry out the search and rescue operation as soon as possible and maintained close communication with the Mongolian side during the search and rescue process to ensure to keep up the latest progress.
Meanwhile, the embassy assisted the family members in publishing the notice for missing persons in Mongolia, and extensively mobilized overseas Chinese and Chinese-funded enterprises in Mongolia to actively participate in searching the missing persons, provide effective clues. The embassy also provided relevant assistance to the members of the Blue Sky Rescue team who went to Mongolia for assistance.
Under the strong boost of the embassy, the Mongolian side immediately sent a rescue team and promised to exempt the search and rescue costs.
The General Bureau of Police and the General Bureau of Emergency of Mongolia instructed the police and emergendy department of Hovsgol province to spare no efforts to search and rescue the missing persons.
Since Khovsgol Lake was located at the border of north of Mongolia and Russia, its location was in remote, and it was a vast territory with a sparse population of which transportation and communication was extremely inconvenient. Meanwhile, Mongolia has currently entered the winter, and the temperature was as low as around -20 degrees. The local police and emergency department overcame great difficulties, almost to mobilize all forces and stimulate the local herdsmen to carry out the carpet search and rescue operation around the wide range of the position where two people lost for days on end through the ways of horse riding, walking, and visiting the herdsmen.
Meanwhile, in view of special conditions in the pastoral areas, the Mongolia side has been circularly publishing the notice of missing persons through the radio for days.
Relevant staff of Chinese Blue Sky Rescue team have also come to Mongolia to actively participate in the rescue work together with the Mongolian side.
The safety of the two missing persons has always affected our hearts.
To date, the two people have been lost for more than 10 days. The embassy successively received some clues, but still cannot find them. The search and rescue operation was still under way.
The embassy would always follow the principle of "people first", sustain attention to this matter, push the Mongolian side to continue the all-out search and rescue operation and provide maximum assistance to the two persons' families.
The embassy appeals to the compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia to contact the Chinese embassy in Mongolia at first time for any relevant clues.

The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a report on the 26th stating that Iran has started to use advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, further violating the nuclear agreement reached with world powers in 2015.
Summarizing foreign media reports, the IAEA report states that Iran’ s Natanz Nuclear Facility’ s advanced centrifuge is “accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium”.
Since the US President Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement in May last year and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran has been gradually violating the restrictions on nuclear agreements reached with major powers in 2015.
The agreement stipulates that Iran can only use first-generation IR-1 centrifuges to refine uranium.
The other signatories of the agreement, Britain, China, France, Germany, and Russia, have been trying to save the agreement, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
On the afternoon of the 25th, local time, Japanese Foreign Minister Motegi Toshimitsu held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York, where Motegi was paying a state visit, and they confirmed that they will push ahead negotiations for concluding the peace treaty covering the territorial issues of the Four Northern Islands (the disputed islands between Japan and Russia; Japan calls these islands the “Four Northern Islands”, Russia calls them the “South Kuril Islands”), as well as develop bilateral relations across a wide range of political and economic issues in the future; they also concluded that Motegi will pay a state visit to Russia as soon as possible, Kyodo News Agency reported.
This is the first time that Motegi spoke with the Russian side as the person in charge of negotiations for concluding the peace treaty after taking the post of Foreign Minister.
Motegi said to the Russian side, “We hope to pursue negotiations on bilateral issues including promotion of common economic activities across the Four Northern Islands.”
According to the Japanese government, the territorial issues were not detailed at the talks.
The Russia-Japan Summit Talks in December 2018 confirmed the policy of pushing ahead negotiations by appointing the two foreign ministers as the delegates in charge of the issue.
At the talks, the two foreign ministers also recognized the progress made in the negotiation on common economic activities in the fields of tourism and waste disposal.
Motegi expressed his hopes for the trial tourism business scheduled to be implemented in October, “I look forward to its successful implementation, so we can take the next step. ”
Moreover, the talks also confirmed that Lavrov will pay a state visit to Japan during the G20 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Nagoya in November.

Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team Expected to Defend the World Cup Championship in Advance!
On September 27, the Chinese team lost one round to the Dutch Women’s Volleyball Team after winning two continuous rounds, and finally defeated them with a score 3:1, thereby welcoming its ninth successive victory.
As the World Cup comes to a close, the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team can’t ignore the Serbian Team, but the Chinese team will soon defend its championship.
In the first two rounds against the Dutch team, the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team performed as aggressively as before, and won two rounds at 25:19 and 25:16, until encountering a setback in the third round.
As they fell behind, the Dutch Women’s Volleyball Team became more aggressive in their serves and attacked the first passer of the Chinese team, and meanwhile, the Chinese team members were only eager to attack, thereby making more and more mistakes, and finally, the Chinese team lost the round at 21:25 to their opponents.
Lang Ping said in an interview after the race, “In the third round, we lost about 8 points due to mistakes. ”
Of course, the Dutch Women’s Volleyball Team is not to be underestimated, and the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team was prepared to meet the challenge before the match, so Lang Ping wasn’t surprised when the team lost one round, “It’s normal to win or lose a match against a powerful team, and it’s also normal to play five rounds, so we told our team members to work hard”, said Lang Ping.
In the fourth round, the team members actively adjusted their tactics: Zhang Changning attacked with full force, scoring 8 points in a single round and contributing greatly to the team’s victory.
To date, only 2 rounds in 11 of match play remain, and the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team nearly has the championship in hand, but the race against the Dutch team has truly sounded an alarm for the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team: the more critical the moment, the more effort should be made.
In another match on September 27, the Russian and American women’s volleyball teams played 5 rounds, and the American team failed to score 3 points from their opponents, thus, the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team can defend its championship by one round in advance, as long as it scores three points in the match against Serbia.
All things are currently going in the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team favor.
The six primary players of the Serbian team will be absent from the match, but this does not necessarily mean they will easily lose three points to the Chinese team.
Judging from the current league table, it is essentially impossible for the Serbian team to win the cup, which means that they will feel no stress in the match against the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team, but they will also make every possible effort to attack the Chinese team, while the Chinese team, in contrast, will feel pressure to defend the championship, which could possibly affect its state.
Besides, the Serbian team, now consisting of backup players, is absolutely not a lamb for anyone to slaughter; in an earlier match against the Dutch team, the Serbian team played five rounds, and finally the Second Serbian Team turned the situation around and defeated the Dutch team, which was composed entirely of first line players, at 3:2, reflecting a very powerful lineup.
Before the matches at the third stage started, Lang Ping noted that neither the Dutch team nor the Serbian team was easy to handle, “The matches in Osaka will be very tough, so we should still prepare properly as usual. ”
Now, the team has sounded the call to defend the championship, and the match has entered its “white-hot stage”.
The Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team has prevailed over its rivals in both ability and lineup, but we still need to wait and see whether the members of the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team can perform at their normal level and unleash the full extent of their powers on the court.

"For 70 years, the containment and defensive measures of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have been based on maintaining technical advantages," Stoltenberg said in the United States Military Academy (West Point). "
He said, "But times are changing."
Stoltenberg said:” The competition we are facing is getting fiercer and fiercer.
So, we should double our efforts to ensure that no one will surpass us. "
He said, "Some new technologies were not developed by the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but in authoritarian countries.
Chinese companies are studying 5G networks.
Russia is developing an independent internet and investing heavily to develop the next generation of weapons, such as hypersonic missiles. "
Stoltenberg said, "The future security of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization depends on our ability to understand, accept, and apply the latest advanced technologies."
On September 24th, the "Take me on a trip with a cruise ticket" event was held in Juzizhoutou, Changsha, for which more than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to board the Star of Juzizhoutou cruise ship to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Xiang River, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the republic of China.
Most of the more than 100 disabled people who participated in the event had never boarded a cruise ship before.
56-year-old Zhao Zhengang is a physically handicapped person who rarely travels due to his inability to use his feet.
He said, "This is my first time on a cruise, I’m very excited to be able to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Xiang River up close and feel Changsha development pulse, and I won’t ever forget this. "
Volunteers from the Changsha Fukang Social Work Service Center and the Blue Sky Rescue Team provided outstanding services for people with disabilities.
For those with severe physical disabilities, volunteers carried them on and off the cruise ship.
The relevant manager of the Fukang Social Work Service Center said that in the past 70 years, with the support of the party and the government, the cause of disabled people in Changsha has continued to develop and make progress, and more and more disabled people have truly become participants and contributors in the economy and society, while caring and helping the disabled and supporting the disabled cause have gradually become widespread social consensus.
As China is about to celebrate the 70th anniversary of its founding, the media is turning its spotlight on the heroes who we barely notice in daily life so that they dazzle under the spotlight, because they are the ones whose brilliant efforts bring us warmth and light, and improve all of our lives.
However, the heroes who walk by our side appear to be ordinary, just like you and me.
Like an old farmer strolling in the fields, Yuan Longping, who devotes himself to hybrid rice research and cultivates a high-yield hybrid rice strain to prevent nationwide starvation; or Nan Rendong, a chief scientist who strives to open China's "eyes" (the world’s largest telescope, FAST), who has concentrated on one thing throughout his entire life, and who, as he eats dry steamed buns in the mountains of Guizhou, a remote area, looks similar to the old men who have experienced the hardships of life in that small village; or Zhou Ruchang, China's leading scholar of the classic novel A Dream of Red Mansions, who was once a rural boy who received a very late education and still had an innocent heart in his old age, and though he possesses a thorough knowledge of both China and the West, he doesn’t act like a scholar at all, instead appearing to the world as a man with disheveled white hair who laughs heartily when he encounters valuable ideas; or Qin Yi, whose fame as a filmmaker is overwhelming in China, and who still frolics in the grasslands for six or seven hours a day for rehearsal despite being over 90 years old, and was willing to perform as an anonymous old maid in “Legend of the Devil Cat”.
They seek their own virtue and live a simple but persistent life, and their passion ignites as they are immersed in careers which outsiders do not understand but which they themselves cherish, regardless of high position and great wealth.
Just like the floor-sweeping monk in the Sutra Pavilion of Shaolin Temple in Jin Yong's novel - though he is exceptionally skillful in martial arts, he is neither arrogant nor vainglorious, neither happy nor sad.
Behind every "floor-sweeping monk" and every innocent heart, one can see their deep feelings of love and responsibility for the country.
The responsibility to develop our country lies not only on the shoulders of heroes, but on hundreds of millions of Chinese.
Once the words of a female middle school student were popular among netizens, "When a hero passes by, someone has to sit roadside and applaud, I don't want to be a hero, I just want to be the one who sits roadside and applauds. ”
In fact, there is no contradiction between being a hero and applauding a hero.
People who applaud by the roadside are also giving us warmth and light, because they themselves are bright-burning stars.
Ordinary people also sometimes have moments in which they become heroes, like Zou Bihua, an excellent judge in Shanghai who shouldered the important task of judicial reform.
But at the annual meeting, he asked the old master of the reception room to come on stage and tell his story, and it turned out that the master sent and received countless newspaper and letters in a whole year without a single mistake, to which Zou Bihua said, "It isn’t easy to do simple things perfectly," and then led the judges in a round of applause for this "floor-sweeping monk".
This is the kind of respect one hero pays to another.
The floor-sweeping monk has the Sutra Pavilion of Shaolin Temple; Yuan Longping has his vast experimental rice fields; Nan Rendong has FAST; Qin Yi has her stage; and Zhou Ruchang has a pulpit…it takes more than just our own efforts to become a hero, it also takes a good environment and positive incentives.
Take, for example, things like FAST, which looked at today, seem like a miracle.
In the 1990s, China's scientists were still struggling to combat difficulties, and the novelist Liu Cixin had not yet started to write The Three Body Problem.
At that time, the largest telescope was at Arecibo, a single-aperture radio telescope in a Puerto Rico valley of the United States, with a diameter of 350 meters, and was considered to be an "unsurpassed" world landmark.
The diameter of Chinese telescopes was less than 1/10 of that.
Nan Rendong, who enjoyed world-class scientific research conditions and salary in Japan, insisted on returning home with an almost crazy idea: to build a new generation of "radio telescopes" in China to receive more messages from outer space!
With so much waiting to be done in China, why would it invest money to listen to stars?
However, the motherland trusted Nan Rendong, and thus began the FAST project.
It took 12 years to select the site and another 9 years from the establishment of the project to its completion.
With a diameter of 500 meters, China’s "eyes" are now open, and that’s how China created an unprecedented second-to-none scientific project.
This is how FAST and all the scientists like Nan Rendong is amazing, as well as how China, which has foresight, stands high, and looks far, is also amazing.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, those like Nan Rendong can become pillars of our country and the courage of our people.
Young talents and white-haired heroes walk by everywhere as people applaud gently by the roadside: what a beautiful and harmonious nation!
Garbage classification introduced to kindergarten in Jilin for the first time
A kindergarten in Jilin City, Jilin Province, launched a garbage classification education class to teach children how to distinguish between recyclable garbage and other types of garbage on the 27th.
It is reported that this is the first time for garbage sorting to be introduced in local preschool education.
Nine departments in Jilin Province jointly issued the Work Plan of Promoting Garbage Classification in Prefecture-level Cities in Jilin Province.
Based on the experience of compulsory garbage classification in Changchun in 2019, the government decided to carry out it in prefectural-level cities.
Jilin City is one of them.
We hope that through this activity, children can affect their family, while the kindergarten itself can persuade all of society to take up garbage classification to protect the environment.
Said Liu Lijuan, executive head of Haifaner International Kindergarten, which held the event.
The director read out the environmental protection proposal, hoping that children would take the lead in sorting garbage.
After performing dance called "Low-carbon Baby", children were divided into groups to play garbage sorting games.
Their instructors also issued labels with words like "Recyclable Waste" and "Other Waste" to children for them to stick on the trash cans and suggested that they shoot a short video when they get home.
Liu Lijuan said the kindergarten has always advocated the concepts of low carbon and environmental protection, and that environmental protection lectures are held on a regular basis.
Sortable trash bins are also placed inside the kindergarten, which bear symbols of garbage types.

Preliminary statistics show that Jilin Province created around 5.4652 million tons of solid waste in 2018, and that all of it was processed at domestic waste plants.
3.2929 million tons were landfilled, 2.0923 million tons were incinerated, and 80,100 tons were utilized in various ways.
After years of effort, all cities and counties in the province now are capable to process domestic garbage in a non-damaging manner.
The issued document, Work Plan for Promoting Garbage Classification at the Prefecture Level in Jilin Province, requires the introduction of garbage classification on campus, in textbooks, and in classes through the creation of garbage classification songs, ballads, comics, and micro videos, as well as strengthening interaction between students and parents, which the government believes is the best way to universalize this concept, ”educating a child to influence his family, then the community, and finally the next generation".
According to data released by Mazda on September 27, global sales in August were 117015 units.
Due to the impact of insufficient launch of new models and reduction of price, sales in China dropped by 21%.
Domestic sales in Japan decreased by 6%, and the need to get on the last bus before the increase of consumption tax in October was limited.
Mazda sold 17729 vehicles in China in August.
Sales in August of 2018 also decreased by 13% from the previous year, and continued to decrease.
Sales of the CX-4, the most popular SUV in China, decreased by 14%.
It has been a long time since the "CX-4" launch in 2016, and the influence of new cars has declined.
The decrease of price reductions due to a long-term strategy to increase brand value has also been reported to have a significant impact on sales.
Mazda’s sales in the U.S. increased by 7% year-on-year to 27482, which was an improvement after 14 months.
In August, the fact that sellers had one more business day than the previous year, together with the "promotional activities such as improving publicity" (Mazda), made the sales of SUVs such as "CX-5" increase.
Domestic sales in Japan fell by 6% to 14422 units.
The company said that the urgent rush to buy before the tax increase "was not as intense as the last time (2014)."
Sales of small cars such as "Demio" decreased.
Jacques Chirac passed away, left a long-lasting political legacy
On the 26th local time, former French President Jacques Chirac died at the age of 86.
At a time when the world was undergoing great changes, much of the political legacy left by this French politician when he was in power are still worthy of our praise.
Chirac served charismatically as president of France for 12 years.
He inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of Gaullism, firmly supported European integration, and is a representative figure in the pursuit of the "European Dream".
As a politician with strategic vision, he vigorously advocated for a multipolar and multilateral world.
For this reason, the French media described him as "an outstanding representative of France on the world stage".
One of Chirac's most widely known decisions is his staunch opposition to the US-led Iraq invasion.
Under his leadership, France, together with Germany, withstood pressure from the United States and stood at the forefront of the anti-war movement.
One year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would aggravate terrorist activities and make the world increasingly dangerous.
Later, Chirac's warning proved to be quite correct.
Now the European integration is bowing in the midst of a raging storm, and as American unilateralism is becoming increasingly prominent, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices in international politics and global affairs is undoubtedly of enlightening significance.
Chirac is also a French politician who is familiar and well-liked by the Chinese.
He is one of the advocates of and creators of the "Golden decade" of Sino-French relations; after being elected president of France for the first time in 1995, he used his position as a politician and his strategic vision to promote the rapid development of Sino-French relations.
China and France soon established a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2004, and the bilateral exchanges between China and France entered a brand-new phase.
During his presidency, the bilateral trade volume between China and France increased rapidly, while the two nations have made spectacular breakthroughs on cooperation in aviation, nuclear energy, railway transport, and other fields.
The “Chinese Culture Year” advocated by Chirac created a novel model of cultural exchange unique in the history of China and France.
Chirac's ardent and life-long love for Chinese culture was particularly impressive.
A Chinese diplomat who knew him well said that Chirac could recite some poems written by Li Bai and Du Fu, and could even accurately judge the historical age of Chinese bronzes.
Chirac has a well-known quote: "One hasn't really been to Egypt without visiting the pyramids; one hasn't really been to China without visiting the Terracotta Warriors.”
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency, Chirac said, "The West has concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems which have emerged during China's economic growth, and China's political status in the international arena.
However, I myself have full confidence in China.
I regard it as a country with long history of civilization, and its experience is enough to help itself establish the concept of harmonious development and assume its own responsibility on the world stage in the long-run. ”
The renaissance of China will bring vitality and creativity to the world’s culture, as well as enrich it.
He is gone, but the political heritage and enlightenment he left to the world will last forever.

Councilors of the Establishment Camp in Hong Kong SAR Legislative Council Countersign against US’ Hong Kong-related Act
On September 27, some councilors of the Establishment Camp in Hong Kong SAR Legislative Council signed a joint declaration to voice their strong opposition against the “Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019” passed by the US Congress Committee on Foreign Affairs.
The declaration, countersigned by 40 councilors from the Establishment Camp, stresses that the rights enjoyed by Hong Kong are conferred by the Basic Law on the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, including maintaining its status as a free trade port and separate customs territory, conducting trade, cooperation, and relations development with different countries/regions worldwide under the name of “Hong Kong China”, and signing and performing bilateral and multilateral agreements.
These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislative authority.
Hong Kong has always strictly observed international protocols, international rules, laws, and commercial ethnics, traded with different countries and regions, and participated in the cooperation covering a broad range of areas, and Hong Kong has made outstanding achievements visible to all people.
The declaration asserts that the US Congress Committee on Foreign Affairs has no need to pass related act, and the act is only a means to echo its role as a troublemaker to Hong Kong, make a tough intervention in the internal affairs of Hong Kong, and seek political chips for their agents who disturb Hong Kong in the region.
The councilors of the Establishment Camp feel deeply regretful of the US Congress’ move and strongly oppose it.
The declaration points out that Hong Kong is an important trade partner of the US and its largest source of trade surplus.
Hong Kong is a good destination for American companies do business thanks to its good legal governance, free and fair business environment, and clean society.
The passing of the act by the US Congress will further worsen China-US relations, harm both the US and China, and will not bring any benefit but only damage to the interests of both Hong Kong and the US.
The declaration notes that Hong Kong will carry out the “one country, two systems” guideline as usual and without change, will continue to enjoy the rights vested by the Basic Law, and will effectively perform its obligations.
Hong Kong will continue to make its due contributions to the international community as well as international trade and commerce, as it has in the past, does so in the present, and will do in the future.
The French National Assembly and Senate will discuss reforms to immigration policy next week, European Minutes reported on the 26th.
French President Macron recently commented with regard to this topic that France cannot “accommodate everyone”, but will strive to make a “proper accommodation”.
According to the report, Macron is attempting to find a compromise in immigration, so there will not be a sharp impact on the brewing debate.
“We hope to propose a dual-track solution in immigration policy, and find the balance between humanitarianism and efficiency,” Macron said in an interview during the General Debate of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Macron said, “To make a proper accommodation (of immigrants), France cannot accommodate everyone.”
Macron enumerated four key points of immigration policy: granting the right of asylum to refugees who need protection as soon as possible; promoting the integration of immigrants more effectively; accommodating and protecting all immigrants entering France; re-accommodating illegal immigrants entering French more effectively.
Whether illegal immigrants should be under the protection of National Medical Assistance (AME) is a topic debated hotly by all circles.
Macron said he hoped to “evaluate” and put a certain restrictions on, but not cancel, this system.
After Macron made such comments, Le Pen, the leader of the far right “National Alliance”, tweeted that Macron indulged in empty talk.
Larcher, a member of the right-wing Republican Party and the President of the Senate, also said that the immigration policy should be discussed in a “moderate” but “realistic” manner, indirectly criticizing Macron.
Vallaud, a senator of the left-wing Socialist Party said that France should accommodate more immigrants and do it better, and criticized Macron for “manipulating” this issue.
As reported, the new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act has been enacted for a year, leading to dissension within the ruling party and failure to appease the right-wing opposition party.
In the next election in 2022, the topic of immigration policy will again become a flashpoint for the far right, and Macron needs to make a difference on this topic, despite the risk of irritating the left wing within the ruling party.
The French National Assembly will enter into a debate on immigration policy from September 30, and the Senate will debate it from October 2, said the report.
There are signs that China’s A shares are ushering in a “buy-back tide”, and many listed companies are vigorously buying back their corporate stocks.
As of the 27th, the total amount of A-share listed company buy-backs in 2019 has been over RMB 100 billion, far exceeding buy-backs in previous years and hitting an all-time record, according to statistics from Eastmoney.com, a financial data service provider.
The overall valuation of the A-share market is low this year, and by buying back at a low price, the listed companies can improve their capital usage efficiency, which also reflects their desire to actively manage market value and their abundant cash flow, which can boost investors’ confidence, said Xu Yang, the chairman of Shanghai Maikerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd.
Moreover, the continuously improving share buy-back system has also promoted listed companies to actively buy back their shares.
For instance, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued detailed rules for buying back shares, providing standards and guidelines for listed companies.
According to some media statistics, since this year, many listed companies in fields such as capital construction, real estate, IT, and electronic equipment manufacturing, have implemented overweighting and buy-back plans.
There are 6 listed companies with buy-back amounts over RMB 1 billion this year.
Out of these companies, Yili Shares is ranked first, with a buy-back amount over RMB 5 billion.
What impact will the listed companies’ buy-back have on the market?
The buy-back, on one hand, shows that the listed company is economically strong and financially healthy, and has the capacity to stabilize its share price and give investors confidence, but on the other hand, it also means that the listed company and its controlling shareholders are responsible for the company, the market, and investors, said Zhao Xijun, the deputy dean of the School of Finance, Renmin University of China, in an interview by China News Service.
The former is based on the company’s good business performance, while the latter requires the listed company and its controlling shareholders to be of high quality.
All of these are the important and fundamental elements for the capital market.
Stock buy-backs by listed companies can give investors more confidence, and support the stock price of listed companies.
The Orient Securities’ research report calculated that A-share market capital will increase up to RMB 150 billion due to buy-backs this year, based on the buy-back amounts predetermined by A-share listed companies at the beginning of the year and the average closing cost of stocks that have been bought back.
After almost 2 months, the restoration of the large mural Drawing of Miracles of Mazu in the Tianjin Temple of the Queen of Heaven, a key cultural relic under state protection, ended on the 26th, and will reopen during the National Day holiday this year.
The Drawing of Miracles of Mazu is a large traditional mural that fully reflects Mazu's life.
With the approval of the relevant departments of China, it was painted by Cai Changkui, the former curator of the Tianjin Folklore Museum (Temple of the Queen of Heaven) from 1991 to 1994.
It is understood that this mural was drawn on the south and north walls of the main hall of Temple of the Queen of Heaven with a total of 32 meters length and 2.6 meters in height; the mural is divided into upper and lower parts, and it makes use of over 30 stories, such as the birth of the queen of heaven, crossing the sea on a seat, and flying to heaven by growing feathers, as well as 358 characters to reflect life stories of Mazu.
Cai Changkui said that it has been rainy in summer and dry in winter in Tianjin in recent years, and that this kind of “wet and dry” weather caused the mural to crack, such that cracked portions cover 60% of the entire mural.
In order to protect and restore the mural of Mazu's stories, the Ancient Culture Street Management Committee in Nankai District of Tianjin and Temple of the Queen of Heaven started the restoration of the main hall and murals in the temple.
The restoration project was led by Cai Changkui and four famous Chinese painters were invited to participate.
The restoration is in line with the principle of “restoration to past condition”, however, the original mural was partially adjusted, and additional restoration was carried out on imperfections in the original mural.
During the restoration, we also made innovative attempt in color, material, ink, and other aspects.
After the restoration, the features, spirituality, spirit, and art style of the original mural were intact.
The Temple of the Queen of Heaven was built in 1326, was formerly known as Tianfei Temple, and is commonly known as Temple of the Queen; after being rebuilt many times, it is the oldest building group in Tianjin and it is also one of the earliest Mazu temples in China.
On September 25th, a grand opening ceremony was held for the Beijing Daxing International Airport.
The Beijing Daxing International Airport terminal is shaped like a “phoenix spreading its wings” and is honored as the first of the “New Seven Wonders of the World”.
Currently, Beijing Capital International Airport is overloaded with traffic having carried over 100 million passengers last year, making it the second airport in the world to handle more than 100 million passengers in a year after Atlanta’s airport in the United States.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to handle 45 million passengers by 2022, with international flights accounting for 20%, and 72 million by 2025, with international flights expected to be above 30%.
So, how cool is this "new gate to the nation"?
Beijing Daxing International Airport, located between Daxing District of Beijing and Guangyang District of Langfang City, Hebei Province, with a straight-line distance of 46 kilometers from Tiananmen Square, is the largest newly built airport in the world.
The projected area of the steel roof of its terminal on the ground is 180,000 square meters, the same area of 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is the world's first terminal which has two arrival floors and two departure floors -- F1-F4, respectively, are international arrivals, domestic arrivals, domestic departures and international departures.
The two-level bridge outside the terminal connects to both the highway and the airport, F3 and F4 of the terminal -- the upper level goes to international departures, while both levels connect to domestic departures.
The first flight from Beijing Daxing International Airport initiated Beijing’s "two airports" era.
The new airport is positioned as a major international aviation hub, a new driving force for national development, and as an integrated transport hub for Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei to support the construction of the Xiongan New Area; to date, 66 airlines have expressed interest in flying from Beijing Daxing International Airport, including 20 domestic airlines and 46 airlines from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and foreign countries, for which the flight schedule applications are slowly undergoing approval.
In winter and spring of 2019, Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, including 101 domestic routes and 15 international routes, which cover 112 destinations around the world, including 97 domestic destinations and 15 international destinations.
It forms an internationally competitive first-class “two-hub” airport layout alongside Beijing Capital International Airport through coordinated development and moderate competition, which not only reduces the close-to-capacity operating pressure currently felt by Beijing Capital International Airport, but also better meets the urgent need for rapid growth of air transport in Beijing and its surrounding areas, and thus enhances the international competitiveness of China's civil aviation.
To secure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daxing International Airport has fully considered its geographical location, and the relationship between the airport and the surrounding airspace and operation environment: its airport runways arranged in an "omnidirectional" layout for the first time in China, it uses the largest air traffic control system in the world, and contains the largest terminal control area in China, which maximizes aviation operational efficiency.
It’s the first time for an airport in China of such size to use automatic baggage handling and an information management system made in China, and the airport uses an innovative baggage transfer model to improve the efficiency of the baggage handling system.
The first flight from Beijing Daxing International Airport symbolizes a phoenix spreading its wings to take off.
The new airport, which has created over 40 global and national “firsts”, and which is more than 98% made in China, will certainly exert direct and indirect economic influences on the surrounding industries, and will inject the airport’s vitality into Beijing's economic development.
MCA tentatively plans to hold a conference in November, plans to lower party’s minimum age to 16
MCA tentatively plans to hold a central representative conference in early November, intending to revise the party constitution and lower the party’s minimum age to 16.

He also explained that the purpose of convening the Central Committee yesterday (26th) was to finalize the date of the representative conference and amend the party constitution, however, it happened to coincide with the unfortunate death of Datuk Mohammad Faree, Bersatu Tanjung Piai Parliament member, thus it has been joined with the agenda for this by-election.
Wang Boxiang, Former Party Secretary of Shouguang County in Shandong Province, Xinhuanet
Wang Boxiang was born in February 1943 in Shouguang, Shandong Province, started work in 1967, and successively served as the secretary of the township party committee, secretary of the county committee, and mayor.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang was appointed as the Party Secretary of Shouguang County in Shandong Province, and at that time, Shouguang was a poor county in Weifang.
During his five-year tenure in Shouguang, Wang Boxiang, who had a desire to serve the people, concentrated on doing three things: first, promoting vegetable industrialization; second, developing the salt marsh in the north of Shouguang; and third, laying the foundation for industry to succeed so that the people of Shouguang could fill their pockets and live with dignity.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables, and also have learned lessons from the practice.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers had abundant harvests of vegetables, but the vegetables could not be sold and rotted in the field.
Through research, Wang Boxiang found that the key to the vegetable industry is to improve circulation.
Shouguang took the lead in establishing a vegetable wholesale market, which was the start of its market economy development.
Party members and leaders should take the lead, because if they fail, the whole county bears the losses.
In 1989, 17 Party members, including Wang Leyi in Sanyuanzhu village, set up 17 winter-warm vegetable greenhouses with the support of Wang Boxiang, and 17 “double 10000-yuan households” emerged in the village that year.
Then the county set up a promotion group, and mobilized by Wang Boxiang, Wang Leyi carried out traveled to various villages and towns to offer guidance; in the first year, more than 5000 vegetable greenhouses were constructed, and then, like a prairie fire, the greenhouses spread to the whole county and even the whole country.
For thousands of years, 1.6 million-mu of land in the north of Shouguang has been shoals, except for a salt marsh.
Life was very hard for the local people.
The south of Shouguang had vegetable greenhouses, so what was the north of Shouguang to do?
Wang Boxiang organized tens of thousands of people to hold a general meeting and then camp at the salt marsh for 40-50 days.
Wang Boxiang and other county leaders lived and ate on the construction site, pushed carts and carried loads alongside the ordinary workers, and went through the rigors of living in the wilderness; the common people gave them a thumbs up sign when they saw them, and admired them from the bottom of their hearts, while at the same time, 150,000 mu of shrimp ponds, 200,000 mu of salt fields, and 600,000 mu of cotton fields were developed in the north of Shouguang, creating a “cornucopia” in the salt marsh.
In July 1986, Wang Boxiang participated in the Weifang Industrial Conference for the first time as a secretary of the County Committee.
During the conference, a “comparison table of industrial economic figures in 12 counties and cities in Weifang” was issued, and at first glance, the total industrial output value of Shouguang was not bad, ranking fourth.
However, if the raw salt was not counted, the pure industrial output value of Shouguang was only 119 million yuan, ranking third from the bottom.
Wang Boxiang took an experience learning group of more than 70 people and went to other places to seek new ideas.
Less than a year after returning, 150 million yuan had been invested in 77 new projects throughout the county.
After that, they organized “experience learning groups” to travel to places such as Shenzhen, Dongguan, and Shanghai to learn more.
Shouguang lacked enterprises, and even lacked entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang held a special meeting to resolve this problem: 40 enterprising and able people stood out from the public selection of factory directors and managers, and were promoted to the frontline of industry.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the top 100 counties in the country, and Wang Boxiang was transferred to serve as vice mayor of Weifang.
What he left behind was more than 200,000 vegetable greenhouses, 120,000 mu of cotton fields, salt fields, and shrimp ponds, 4854 enterprises, more than 100,000 “10,000-yuan households”, and cadre teams approved of by the common people. Shouguang people still affectionately call him “our Secretary Boxiang”.
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi hosted the China and Security Council African Member States Conference of Foreign Ministers at United Nations Headquarters in New York on September 26 local time.
African current Security Council Member States Cote d'ivoire’s Foreign Minister Tarnow, Equatorial Guinea’s Foreign Minister Oyono, and South Africa’s Foreign Minister Pandor, as well as candidate Member States Niger’s Foreign Minister Kara and Tunisia’s Foreign Minister Jessnawi attended the meeting.
Wang Yi made four suggestions on strengthening cooperation between China and Africa in the Security Council.
First, obtaining strength through unity.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, and the direct consequence is that the basic norms of international relations are challenged, the role of the Unite Nations is impacted, and the interests of a large number of developing countries and middle and small countries, including African countries, are harmed.
China and Africa need to work hand in hand and side by side to meet this challenge, because only through unity can they have strength.
In the Security Council, when the three African countries speak with one voice, the focus is not just on their three votes, but the entire African continent.
When China and Africa stand together, it adds up to more than four votes, and instead leads other countries to follow up, and thereby influence and shape the Security Council agenda.
In 2018, China established the “3+1” coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council, so we must make full use of this coordination mechanism.
Second, we must resolve disputes through negotiation.
China has always advocated the political resolution of hot-button issues, and Africa has a good tradition of negotiation, as well as the experience of successful mediation by regional and sub-regional African organizations.
For many complex problems in the Security Council agenda, especially hot-button issues in Africa, most are the legacy of colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.
We should jointly make good use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and give full play to the role of the United Nations in mediation, conciliation, etc.
Third, we must seek self-improvement autonomously.
African countries and people know best about Africa’s problems, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
When dealing with hot-button issues in Africa, the Security Council should pay attention to listening to and respecting the wishes of Africa, should allow regional and sub-regional organizations to play their role, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is willing to strengthen coordination with Africa and firmly promote capability building for autonomous peace operation in Africa.
Fourth, resolve root conflicts through development.
China and African countries are both developing countries, we must persist in putting economic and social development first and mutually support the development path chosen by each nation.
China is willing to closely link the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative with the 2063 Agenda of the African Union, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries to enhance their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflict.
We will jointly push the United Nations to increase investment in the development of Africa.
The Ebola epidemic outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has restarted, and China has and will continue to fully support and provide human and material help with our power; China is also willing to coordinate its actions with African nations to mobilize the institutions such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization to expand assistance and give full play to the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Multiple Departments (Including the Neonatology Department) Saved a Little Life Together.
Breathtaking!
A pregnant mother delivered her second child, a 32-week-old premature infant, in the passenger seat of their car as her husband was driving on the way to the hospital.
Fortunately, the obstetricians and neonatologists provided timely treatment, and together saved this little life.
Coincidentally, the Obstetrics Department and Neonatology Department of the Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital in Hubei received three premature infants delivered in this matter three days in a row on the 19th, 20th and 21st, but the other two babies were both 29-week-old and delivered in the 120 emergency hotline ambulance.
Ms. Cheng, whose delivery of her second child was imminent, felt stomach pains at 7:00 am on September 19, so she packed up all maternity items and prepared to take a shower and then go to the hospital, in consideration of the fact that she was 32 weeks pregnant and her first child was also premature.
After 9:30 am, Ms. Cheng was ready, and her husband drove her from their home in Xudong to the hospital.
But unexpectedly, soon after they took to the road, the baby was delivered in the passenger seat.
20 minutes later, Ms. Cheng and her baby arrived at the Obstetrics-Gynecology Building of Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital in Hubei.
Seeing the flustered couple and the baby, the security guard informed the Obstetrics Department immediately, and quickly , the associate chief physician, Zhang Huan, three other doctors, and the midwife Liu Yanyan grabbed the maternity package and umbilical cord tray rushed downstairs to them.
“She was sprawled in the passenger seat, with amniotic fluid and blood under her body, and next to her there was a baby boy with the umbilical cord connected. ”
Zhang Huan was informed that the baby was a 32-week-old premature infant, and as the parents had no time to cover the baby with a blanket in their rush to get there, in the cool morning of the early autumn, the baby wasn’t crying, and had a sickly pallor, limp arms, and cold legs.
Liu Yanyan rushed to treat the umbilical cord while Zhang Huan got into the cab and covered the baby with layers of sterile towels and swaddle from the maternity package, and then cleared the baby’s respiratory tract (as shown in the photo), and then, after this careful treatment, the baby was taken to the Neonatology Department on the 12th floor.
Upon being informed, the neonatal doctors and nurses rushed to the nurse station and rescued the premature baby on the spot.
The baby was black in the face and asphyxiated at times, so the doctor used tracheal intubation immediately, and in less than a minute, the baby’s heartbeat was restored, his skin turned ruddy, and the resuscitation was successful.
After admission, the 32-week-old baby was treated with an invasive ventilator, and the continued rescue effort finally allowed the baby’s breath to be steady and smooth, after which the ventilator was removed the next day.
After a week of treatment, the baby now has stable vital signs, regular breathing, and has begun to suckle.
Coincidentally, the hospital’s Obstetrics Department and Neonatology Department received three premature infants delivered on the way three days in a row on the 19th, 20th and 21st; the other two babies are both 29 weeks old and were delivered in the 120 emergency hotline ambulance, and they are now being treated in the Neonatology Department.
Sun Guoqiang, the director of the Obstetrics Department, said, “In recent years, our hospital has received many babies delivered in subways and private cars, but without proper care, both the baby and the mother will be in mortal danger.”
Mr. Sun suggested that once an expecting mother experiences stomach pains, rupture of membranes, or sees blood, she should go to the hospital immediately.
If the baby is being delivered at home or on the road, the mother should lie on the back and put a blanket under the buttocks to prevent the head of the baby hitting the floor, and the newborn baby should be kept warm and brought to the nearest hospital.

"The most beautiful unmarried princess in the world" is engaged!
According to the British "Metro News", Buckingham Palace announced on the 26th that British Princess Beatrice and Mozzi were engaged.
It is reported that Mozzi is a 34-year-old Italian billionaire, mainly engaged in real estate development.

Up To Three Points Per Free Throw?
On the 27th (GMT+8), the NBA Gatorade League announced the new free throw rule - one free throw will be worth one, two, or three points depending on where and when a player is fouled on the shot.
The NBA star Shaquille O’Neal has a low free throw percentage.
Under the new rule, a foul on a made shot will result in a usual free-throw shot worth one point, a foul on a missed shot in two-point range will result in one free throw worth two points, and a foul on a missed three-point shot will result in one free throw worth three points.
The rule will not apply in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter or for the entirety of any overtime period.
This rule is only an experiment in the NBA Gatorade League in the new season, but fans are more concerned about what impact it will bring on players if the new rule is enforced in NBA.
Many people think that the new rule may be good for James Harden, but bad for LeBron James, as his free throw percentage is less than impressive.
Wuhan offers subsidies of up to 20 million yuan to promote the smart transformation of industrial enterprises
As this reporter learned from the “Appreciate New China and Welcome CISM Military World Games” press conference, held by the Information Office of the Wuhan Municipal Government on the 27th, since the beginning of this year, Wuhan has accelerated smart transformation of industries, and will grant a transformation subsidy of up to 20 million yuan.
To date, demand for smart transformation has been recorded from more than 800 above-scale industrial enterprises.
Zhang Hong, deputy director of the Wuhan Economy and Information Technology Bureau, said that starting from this year, Wuhan will launch an action plan for the smart transformation of industrial enterprises, providing free consultation and diagnosis services and solutions for industrial enterprises above a certain size in need to comprehensively promote a new round of technological transformation to create advanced enterprises.
Wuhan will publicly select a number of professional diagnostic service institutions every year based on this plan, and will conduct a general demand survey for all industrial enterprises of above a certain size in Wuhan through media forums, questionnaires, door-to-door reports, etc.
So far, smart transformation requirements from more than 800 above-scale industrial enterprises has been collected, accounting for nearly 1/3 of above-scale industrial enterprises.
Five municipal diagnostic platforms have organized teams to enter enterprises in batches, which will then carry out well-targeted on-site evaluation and scheme demonstrations.
Zhang Hong said that at present, 373 smart transformation projects are being arranged and implemented, with a total planned investment of 29.76 billion yuan, and that pioneering smart workshops and smart factories are initiating such projects, such as Hongxin Communication's first 5G smart production line in central China, Motorola's leading smart mobile phone production line, Wuhan Siemens unmanned transformer factory, CASIC's first batch satellite production line, Hvsen’s world-leading smart production line for new veterinary drugs, and Oubon’s IoT smart production line.
Beyond this, Wuhan has also increased financial and fiscal support for smart transformation projects.
Industrial enterprises carrying out smart transformation will receive investment according to their actual completion, including equipment, hardware, and R&D investment, with a transformation subsidy of 8% and a maximum of 20 million yuan.
At the same time, the municipal government has proactively joined forces with the Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Commercial Bank Wuhan Branch, and other financial institutions to provide personalized financial services specifically for industrial enterprises involved in this project to alleviate their financing pressure.
Will wearing blackface pose an obstacle for Trudeau’s reelection plan?
It was Trudeau himself who dug the pit he fell into this time.
Recently, the Canadian media have exposed a number of old photos of the current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which his face was in dark make-up.
This was considered an obvious act of racial discrimination and immediately caused an uproar in Canada.
Afterward, Trudeau apologized to the public.
But it seems that the Canadians aren’t so easily placated.
Trudeau lifted a rock only to drop it on his own toes.
As pointed out by political commentator Riley, since the rise of the "anti-blackface movement" in the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been accused the opposition or dissidents of their own party of such violations, repeatedly declaring that "whoever makes a mistake like this should be fired immediately".
To put it simply, it was Trudeau himself who dug the "big hole" into which he fell.
Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, is young and handsome, and has been extremely popular since he became involved in political circles.
Despite his lack of experience in political elections, he achieved an unexpected outcome in the 2015 Canadian federal legislative election after taking over the Federal Liberal Party, and the Federal Liberal Party won the valuable right to form a separate cabinet with more than half of the seats in the Federal House of Commons.
At that time, Trudeau espoused many enlightened political slogans, such as "ethnic and gender equality", "ecological environmental protection", "economic revitalization", and “anti-corruption”.
But the truth is, during his five years of governance, he has come to a dead end in almost all of the above-mentioned aspects and little progress has been made.
Despite the "blackface" incident, he only paid lip service to "ethnicity and gender equality", causing indigenous groups and leaders to move protest tents to the gates of Capital Hill on the 150th anniversary of Canada.
In terms of anti-corruption, Trudeau was involved in the "SNC Lavalin incident" at the end of last year.
It was exposed that SNC Lavalin, a construction and engineering company in his hometown, had engaged in favoritism and committed irregularities, and instead of punishing the offender, Trudeau breached ethics rules by pressuring the former justice minister to ensure SNC Lavalin avoided a corruption trial.
Once the matter grew in significance, Trudeau became angry with the official who disclosed the corruption case, Jody Wilson-Raybould, the Attorney General of Canada, who was the first person to disclose the fraud case and directly handled it.
Although doubts still remained in the case itself, his interference is undeniable.
Observers point out that the collapse of Trudeau's reputation after five years in power was primarily caused by his own deeds, and that now he is paying the penalty for falling to fulfill his promise and exercising loose self-discipline.
According to Canada's most authoritative Angus-Reid poll, the number of respondents who supported Trudeau has slipped from more than 60% to just over 30% since 2015, while opponents have soared from less than 30% to more than 60%.
Although other opposition parties and their party leaders have performed poorly, and a considerable number of voters are still willing to vote for the Federal Liberal Party, the voters are dismissive of the head of the ruling party.
On October 21st, when the new Canadian federal legislative election is about to begin, will Trudeau be able to reproduce his victory five years ago?
The answer may disappoint him.
The establishment of Beijing Daxing International Airport has a far-reaching and positive effect on enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration, and the integrated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area.
Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially opened on September 25.
This Beijing News reporter learned from the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission that the Beijing Capital Airport is already oversaturated, and the opening of Daxing International Airport will greatly improve Beijing’s aviation service capacity.
Beijing has become the second city with two airports after Shanghai, in that similar to the model wherein Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport mainly serves domestic aviation, while Pudong Airport mainly deals with international shipping and aviation, Capital Airport and Daxing Airport will also provide differentiated services to serve domestic and international aviation in the future.
The opening of Daxing Airport is beneficial to Capital Airport from a business development perspective.
In 2018, the passenger throughput of Capital Airport exceeded 100 million, ranking first domestically, but its transport capacity is not enough to cope with the rapid growth of demand, especially the demand for international routes.
In order to better serve domestic and foreign passengers in their tourism and business trips and keep up with Beijing’s trend of internationalization, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large hub for international flights, and it is estimated to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million while also offering mail transportation handling volume of 4 million tons.
Therefore, the two airports play separate roles, target different customer groups, and have sufficient market space.
From the economic perspective, Daxing Airport will obviously help to produce win-win result, ease the tense situation of Beijing’s aviation capacity, accelerate the growth of passenger and cargo throughput volume, and achieving dual-track growth for the capital’s aviation industry.
For users, the opening of Daxing International Airport gives them another option beyond Capital Airport, and also perfectly resolves problems caused by the excessive concentration of routes, such as long transit guarantee time and slow boarding speed of passengers, which may indirectly increase the stay time of aircraft and passengers at the airport and make airport operation less efficient, thus, by alleviating burdens of the Capital Airport, the new airport also improves the travel experience for passengers.
Based on media reports, we have calculated the time and cost of various transportation routes to this airport: 1) 50 minutes’ drive by taking the Jingkai Expressway directly to Daxing Airport Expressway from the South Fifth Ring Road, which will cost 40 yuan in total, with the highway tolls being 15 yuan; 2) take Daxing Airport Subway, for which the distance varies from 20 km and 30 km, and for which the ticket price is 10, 25, or 35 yuan; 3) take the Jingxiong Intercity Train, which takes only more than 20 minutes from Beijing West Railway Station to Daxing Airport Station.
On the whole, a variety of means are available for citizens to reach the Airport, and the cost and time are reasonable.
From the perspective of overall development trends, Daxing Airport is positioned as a Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei transportation hub, meaning it is positioned a little far away from Beijing, but it strengthens Beijing’s connection to Hebei and Tianjin, makes it easier for more people to travel, and is of great significance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
Passengers in Hebei and Tianjin will enjoy more international air route services provided by Daxing International Airport, which is expressed in its traffic planning.
Daxing Airport’s supporting transportation facilities are well-equipped, and beyond the new airport line from downtown Beijing to Daxing Airport, a number of highways also connect Daxing Airport with the surrounding areas.
Just like passengers in Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan, and other cities near Guangdong can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport through the Guangzhou-Foshan and Guangzhou-Shenzhen expressways, residents of Langfang and Xiongan New Area will also benefit from Daxing Airport and have access to convenient and efficient aviation services.
Therefore, the opening of Daxing International Airport is not only about extra runways and aircraft, it has far-reaching and proactive impacts on enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration, and the integrated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei; it is not only related to the long-term layout and development of Beijing's logistics industry, but provides more travel options for the vast number of residents in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, promotes the service quality of Beijing logistics industry, and also promotes the development process of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei integration and the economic and trade development of the areas around Daxing Airport.
So, as we take account of the opening of Daxing International Airport, we should look beyond the mere benefits to individuals and see its greater benefit to society’s overall development.

2019 Vietnam Forum on Economic and Social Issues held in Thua Thien-Hue Province
Ruan Dejian, Deputy Director of the Economic Committee of the Vietnamese Congress, revealed that at the beginning of this year, Vietnam’s economy and society presented many new improvements and continued to maintain a trend of growth.
This forum focused on the prominent economic and social issues in the first few months of 2019, and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and in 2020.
At the forum, the participating delegates exchanged in-depth opinions and views on 4 topics, which included economic development in 2019, the impact of some free-trade agreements, some prominent issues of the Vietnamese economy, society and culture in 2019, and predictions and suggestions for economic and social development in Vietnam in 2020.
Delegates generally believed that in the first few months of 2019, global economic growth had slowed down, and that risks and challenges had increased.
Trade frictions between major economies had further contracted global trade and investment.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), despite the fact that global economy is full of uncertainties, and 70% of the world ’s economies are in a state of stagnation, Vietnam’s economy has still achieved many gratifying developments, the macro economy in Vietnam has been operating smoothly, and inflation has been effectively controlled in the first half of 2019, while the consumer price index increased by an average of 2.64%, which is the lowest increase in the past three years.
In the first half of 2019, the GDP of Vietnam increased by 6.76%, and although the rate is lower than 7.05% in the same period last year, compared with the same period in the 2011-2017 period, the growth rate is still relatively high.
When making predictions about Vietnam's economic development trend from 2019 to 2020, Deng Deying, Deputy Director of the National Economic and Social Prediction Center of Vietnam, said that in the context of world economic turmoil, the Vietnamese economy in 2019 showed strong growth.
It is estimated that by 2020, Vietnam's macro economy will continue to be basically stable, the implementation of various free-trade agreements will help promote trade, but as economic restructuring and the improvement of the business environment will be further strengthened, due to the impact of trade friction, Vietnam's export activities will show a downward trend.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen monitoring and risk warning mechanisms, proactively seek trade remedy measures for Vietnam's export commodities, look for opportunities to expand new export markets, and create convenience for the export of various commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, the inflation rate should be kept at a reasonable level to promote the development of auxiliary industries, and the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture, and ecological agriculture should be supported.
Liu Zhijie, director of the Consular Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia in Siem Reap, held a reception in Siem Reap on the 26th to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Peoples Republic of China.
During the 70 years since the founding of the Peoples Republic of China, China has actively participated in international affairs, offering Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to improve global economic governance and common development, and thus has made important contributions to world peace and development, and has brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic growth, as well as people's livelihoods and well-being, said Liu Zhijie.
Liu Zhijie said that as the world's second largest economy, China is responsible for more than 30% of world economic growth, and especially thanks to China's "Belt and Road Initiative", China's local provinces and cities on one side and Siem Reap and its neighbors on the other have made substantive headway in their cooperation.
He said that this is the 61st year of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia, and that as the two countries share brotherly friendship, their mutually beneficial cooperation will become the driving force for local economic and social development.
Tea Seyha, governor of Siem Reap Province, spoke highly of China’s great achievements over the past 70 years, and congratulated both sides for accomplishments made throughout friendly cooperation between China and Cambodia.
Tea Seyha hoped that the two sides would continue to work together to promote Sino-Cambodian friendship, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit, and continue to improve people's living standards.
Tea Seyha said that the friendly exchanges between Siem Reap and China’s provinces and cities are noticeable, in that Siem Reap has established friendship-city relations with 28 provinces and cities in China so far, and collaboration projects including large-scale cultural tourism complexes, namely "Angkor Smile" and "Angkor Dynasty", the Siem Reap-Guangxi agricultural demonstration park, the Siem Reap new international airport project, special training courses for Siem Reap provincial government officials, scholarships for Siem Reap students studying in China, free rural clinics, construction and improvements of urban roads, as well as a public welfare project for cataract treatment called "Guang Ming Xing", have proved fruitful, and in which the people of Siem Reap have become the direct beneficiaries.
Khim Bun Song, the secretary of the Ministry of National Defense (Cambodia), the president of the Siem Reap Provincial Council, the governors of five provinces, representatives of the Siem Reap Branch of the Council of Sino-Cambodia, volunteer teachers, representatives of the Chinese Siem Reap Branch of Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, representatives of Chinese enterprises, and diplomatic representatives of foreign nations in Siem Reap attended the reception.
Witnessing the decade of digital China in Cloud Town—Xinhuanet
If the 2009 local website forum is regarded as the starting point, the 2019 Cloud Town Conference held in Hangzhou from the 25th to the 27th has gone through a full decade.
From a visional concept to a "cloud" practice, big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies supporting China's economic development, social management, and public services in the past 10 years.
In the CHNT New Energy Photovoltaic Cell Workshop in Haining, Zhejiang, recently, a new “colleague” loaded with Alibaba's artificial intelligence was placed beside the quality inspector.
It works 24 hours a day, the recognition speed is more than twice that of manual checks, and the accuracy of quality inspection is stable at more than 95%.
According to the company's director, the "quality inspector" with the camera has concentrated on learning from more than 40,000 defective samples, and with the power of cloud computing behind it, it can quickly convert infrared images into binary language and sort out defective batteries.
The company is just one example of how cloud computing is helping to transform manufacturing today.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the Guide to Promote the Cloud Implementation of Enterprises (2018-2020) in 2018, and proposed that by 2020, they will strive to achieve a noticeable increase in cloud awareness and enthusiasm for enterprises, as well as a significant increase in the proportion and depth of cloud adoption.
Alibaba Cloud founder Wang Jian said that data-centric cloud computing has built a bridge and opened the way for the digital economy where data is a key element.
At the same time, in the past 10 years, the scale of China's cloud computing industry has continued to expand.
According to the White Paper on Cloud Computing Development (2019) released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology in July this year, the total market size of China's cloud computing in 2018 reached 96.28 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2% over 2017.
In addition to being a key technology supporting industrial transformation and the development of digital economy, the invisible "cloud" has also imperceptibly changed urban management and social life.
In this year's Cloud Town Conference, the "city brain" presented for three consecutive years is still attracting people’s attention.
According to Alibaba Cloud, the current urban brain has become a city management hub from a traffic management tool, and related cooperation applications have been expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception and artificial intelligence algorithms, the city brain can realize new city management service functions such as “stop and pay”, “real-time perception of visits”, and “tourist route design” through powerful computing capabilities.
In the field of government service, “One Cloud” is used to connect with “One Affair”, and “Office on Mobile” and “Service on Mobile” are jointly promoted, cloud computing has brought convenience to both ends of the government services.
At present, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform across the province through government affairs on the cloud.
As of September 11, this platform has covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province, and collected 19.08 billion pieces of data in 3066 categories.
Zhejiang's government departments make an average of 12 million calls and share data every month, and each additional call on the cloud may mean less people running errands.
Be Cautious about Making Tea with Plastic Tea Bags!
The Central News Agency reports that the latest Canadian research has found that one plastic tea bag may release billions and even tens of billions of plastic particles, which is significantly higher than the number of plastic micro-particles a person takes in throughout the year, however, no evidence so far proves that the intake of plastic particles is a danger to humans.
According to the report, the researchers of McGill University found that after soaking in a cup of hot water that is almost boiling (95 Celsius degrees), it will release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanometer-size plastic particles in the cup.
This quantity is significantly higher than the number of plastic micro-particles a person takes in throughout the year.
Earlier research published in 2019 reveals that generally, a person consumes at least 50,000 plastic particles and aspirates the same amount of plastic particles.
In this study, which was published in the Environmental Science and Technology Journal, the researchers tested four different types of commercial plastic tea bags collected at stores and cafes in Montreal, opened the tea bags, cleaned them, soaked them in water that was almost boiling for 5 minutes, and then analyzed the particles with an electron microscope and spectrograph.
According to their research, a single tea bag can release more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, “which is higher than the plastic load of other earlier foods by several magnitudes”.
According to the report, most tea bags are made of natural fibers, but many tea bag brands which use natural fibers still seal the bags with plastics.
Some brands no longer use paper tea bags, but have turned to plastics, and it is these plastic tea bags that the researchers tested.
Plastic particles are tiny fragments of plastic, and researchers have defined the size of these plastic particles at 100 nanometers to 5 centimeters, which are produced mainly from the decomposition of plastic garbage.
Researchers have found the traces of plastic particles in the air, soil, and rivers across the world, as well as in the deepest oceanic trench, and these plastic particles also can be found in tap water, bottled water, sea foods, and beer.
In October 2018, researchers first detected plastic particles in human feces samples collected in several countries of different regions worldwide.
To test the potential toxicity of the plastic particles released from the tea bags, this Canadian research team put water fleas into polluted water and found that these plastic particles affected the behaviors of these fleas and caused them to suffer developmental malformation.
So far, there is no evidence proving that the intake of plastic particles threatens humans, says the World Health Organization (WHO).
However, the WHO points out that we should perform more research to fully understand how these plastic particles spread in the environment and how they affect people.
The researchers surmise that these tea bags release a large number of plastic particles possibly because after contact with the boiled water, these plastic bags, even “food-grade” plastic, may decompose or leach toxic substances after they are heated to above 40 Celsius degrees.
Guterres said that the climate emergency is the largest threat to the survival of small island countries.
There, natural disaster will erode their development achievements within one generation.
The disasters in Barbuda, Dominica, and the Bahamas, which have been hit by hurricanes, serve to illustrate this point.
About a quarter of people in small island developing countries live at an attitude of 5 meters or less above sea level.
Relocation may seriously affect their society and lifestyle, and may even cause problems with aspects of sovereignty and national identity.
At the Climate Action Summit on Monday, small island countries worked together to realize carbon neutral 100 percent renewable energy before 2030, becoming leaders for the world to move in the right direction again.
Guterres said, "The climate crisis is stacking new injustices over old injustices.
Although contributing little to global warming, small island developing countries have paid the highest price.
Since these countries are middle-income status, many are caught in accelerated and unsustainable cycles of disaster and debt.
The world must take action, for now is the time to make big decisions and make large investment in small island developing countries. "
Today’s high-level meeting issued a political declaration calling for seeking a method to help small island developing countries to manage their disaster risks, invest in basic facilities with climate adaptability, and transition to renewable energy, and also urged international organizations to help small island developing countries, especially debt-ridden middle-income countries, to obtain funding.
Small island developing countries are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the earth’s lifeline--the ocean.
The latest special report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week confirms that the ocean is suffering from "sweeping" serious consequences of the climate crisis.
According to this report, once-in-a-century sea level rise may occur in many regions by the middle of this century.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable if significant funding is not invested in adapting to the problem.
Pollution, overfishing, and acidification have caused huge losses.
The world has lost half of its live coral in the past 150 years, and plastic pollution has been increased by 10 times in the past 40 years.
Demand from industry, shipping, mining, and tourism is leading to reduced resources, including the fish stocks necessary for maintaining many island communities.
Small island countries also faces high costs of transportation, energy, and basic facilities.
They depend heavily on certain external markets and are subjected to price fluctuation.
Some countries are struggling to deal with the security implications of illegal trafficking in persons, weapons, and drugs.
Guterres said, "If a problem can be solved in the most challenging environment, the problem can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing countries to realize the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons, and examples for the world to learn from. "
He emphasized that the small island developing countries were special cases of sustainable development.
They need long-term attention and investment from the entire international community.
India’s financial system has sufficient liquidity, says its Finance Ministry.
Driven by holiday spending, India's economy is expected to grow again in the second half of the current fiscal year, as the financial system has sufficient liquidity, Finance Minister Sitharaman said on the 26th.
Sitharaman made the above statement after meeting with representatives of private banks, non-bank financial institutions, and housing banks in India.
Sitharaman did not indicate the relevance of these remarks.
Earlier, some Indian and overseas media attributed India's sustained economic slowdownto the current tight liquidity of non-bank financial institutions.
Citing the decline in auto sales, Sitharaman denied that liquidity was the main reason for the drop.
Sitharaman noted that the decline in auto sales was largely driven by cyclical factors.
And he expected growth to resume in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday spending.
India's annual shopping season starts in September and runs until the end of the year.

Shinzo Abe Posted a Video to Celebrate the 70th Anniversary of the Founding of New China and Presented a Congratulation Speech in Chinese
On September 26, local time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe posted a video to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good evening, I’m Shinzo Abe.
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, I would like to, on behalf of Japanese government and people, offer my warmest congratulations.
In June, the G20 Osaka Summit was held successfully through the joint efforts of China and Japan, and the Summit also endorsed G20 Osaka Leaders’ Declaration, which declared to the world the G20’s unbreakable will.
Moreover, at the Sino-Japan Summit talks and dinner before G20 Osaka Summit, we agreed that President Xi Jinping will pay a state visit to Japan next spring, and unanimously determined to open up a new era for China and Japan.
China and Japan share a great responsibility for peace and prosperity of Asia and the world.
I firmly believe that we should cope with regional and global issues, and make contributions to the international community together, which is what will help us build a new model for Sino-Japan relations in the future.
Finally, I wish us a flourishing relationship and my friends a prosperous career.
“Over-age migrant workers on some construction sites may account for more than half.
Where can we find young workers?
Though we do not want to use so many 'old people' on the construction site, there is nothing we can do about it. ”
Zou Kui sighed, who has worked as an engineering contractor in construction industry for many years, because recently, quite a few over-age migrant workers (over the retirement age) are working on construction sites.
Recently, the university where this writer is located has been carrying out rain and pollution diversion project, which means many migrant workers work inside the campus, and if we pay attention, we notice that many of them are over-age migrant workers.
They do not work because they feel bored at home, they do so out of necessity as they save money to solve pension and medical issues, or to finance their children; these are the driving forces for these senior citizens, who should be retired and enjoy their later years.
It’s not as easy as we might think to ensure those workers be well taken care of.
Raising children, supporting the elderly, paying for their children’s education, helping the next generation build houses and buy cars, and helping them to them get married and settle down, and raising their grandchildren are the ”life tasks” for these workers, and when these migrant workers have completed their "life tasks", their pockets are empty, or they may even incur heavy debts, causing most of them have little savings.
To support their children and save more money for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "working until they can't anymore".
Younger migrant workers, like those born in the 1980’s, 1990’s, and 2000’s, are unwilling to engage in secondary industries or low-end service industries that are difficult and require heavy labor, resulting in a structural "labor shortage", which in turn means these unattractive jobs provide opportunities for over-age migrant workers.
Due to the lack of skills and the decline of physical function and working ability, a great deal of over-age migrant workers are doing jobs with heavy physical demands, low income, high risks, and few guarantees.
Behind their attitude that “every day and every cent count”, the difficulties surviving faced by these “tireless” over-age migrant workers must not be ignored or disregarded.
Their living conditions can be enhanced through guaranteeing their right to get paid, improving labor protection, reducing safety risks, and increasing labor income, because despite the fact that they "can save themselves", it is also important to have institutional protection and humanistic care from the public sector.
Some scholars have pointed out that over-age migrant workers are unlikely to be able to rely on farming in their hometowns to resolve their pension and medical problems, and that they have to find other ways to support their families.
Understanding the helpless mood and strong character of these “tireless” over-age migrant workers will help us to better understand their love and pain.
The public sector, the market, and society need to share responsibility and work together to create beneficial interactions, so that as we notice these over-age migrant workers and hear their plight, we can think of ways to ensure they genuinely are taken care of when the return to their hometowns.
Chemezov said that Russia would not export the system in the next five years, because “it must supply our army firstly, and only then can be produced for export.”
This practice fully conforms to international practice.
The main producing countries of weapons and military equipment always ensure their own defense needs before processing export orders.
Earlier, Yuri Glekhov, deputy commander in chief of VKS, said that the development of the system was about to completed.
The S-500 system was developed by the “Almaz-Antey” air-space defense Konzern.
This is next-generation air defense system, which adopts the destruction of ballistic and aerodynamic targets as its working principle.
The main function of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles; the S-500 can intercept missiles within a range of 3500 kilometers.
In addition, according to some data, the S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles, aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft and hypersonic missiles with speeds exceeding 5 times the speed of sound, even targets located in near space.
This weapon also can be integrated with other air defense systems, especially the S-400 system, to form a unified network, which is very important from the perspective of national defense.
Sergei Chermezov paid special attention to the S-400.
He said that there was currently great demand for the system in the world, but the Russian army also needs it, including in the Arctic region.
The S-400 air defense system was put into service for the Arctic air defense group.
According to the news on September 15, the modification of the S-400 air defense missile system by the Arctic air defense group in Novaya Zemlya has been completed.
This is not Russian militarization of the Arctic region.
The Russian Ministry of Defense said that this was entirely part of a transition process to more advanced defense tools in the northern strategic direction.
The Russian Northern Fleet News Service said, “With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controllable airspace of the Arctic region is significantly increased. "
It is critical that the system is used successfully in the Far North and Arctic regions, according to the military’s assessment.
The officers and soldiers of the air defense group were trained for the new system and ready for combat duty.
S-300 long-range air defense systems were provided there previously, and one part of that systems remains at present.
The air defense system must have weapons capable of destroying various aerial targets, no matter whether the targets are flying at high speed in the outer atmosphere at high-altitude or are neglected targets close to the protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 “Triumph” system developed by the “Almaz-Antey” air-space defense Konzern is designed for attacking strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets, and other air attack weapons.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within the range of 400 kilometers, and can shoot down the ballistic target flying at 4.8 km/s within a range of 60 kilometers.
Russia has never concealed that it will supplement and deploy air defense forces in the Far North to ensure the airspace safety of the Northern Sea Route.
The first 12 sets of “Tor-M2DT” air defense missile systems were delivered to the Russian arctic region not long ago, and together, they were sufficient to form an air defense battalion to strengthen the air defense system in the Arctic region.
At the time, the Russian Defense Ministry said that the Arctic “Tor” army would be expanded to a complete brigade-level system in the future.
Together with the S-400 long-range systems newly deployed in Novaya Zemlya and the “Pantsir-SA” short-range system deployed in the Far North, these advanced air defense weapons form a powerful defense for Russia’s polar sky.
It will be difficult for enemy aircraft, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicle missiles to break through this defense.
According to the ideal of the Russian government, the flagship store will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, and thus avoiding the complicated and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
Epinduo Company, as an operator of Russian goods store, focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
Epinduo has online stores on China’s largest trading platforms such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, ShouQ, and multifunctional instant messaging software Wechat, and has its own online platform Epinduo.com, as well as Russian goods retail chain stores.
The Russian Export Center, in partnership with Epinduo, will develop store market strategies and participation standards, and will screen enterprises which put products on virtual shelves.
The store plans to open at the end of this year, and to place products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers on its shelves.
Data from the Russian Export Center shows that there are up to 1 billion total monthly visits to Chinese e-commerce platform.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been showing steady growth since 2014, exceeding 1 billion USD in 2018.
At present, Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia, and Singapore within the global import strategic framework.
According to Alexei Kozevnikov, the new store will display goods from enterprises with a sales volume of at least 5 million rubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and the sales volume of 5 million rubles is not enough.
We all know that Chinese customers have a very positive attitude towards Russian goods and regard our goods as high-quality and green products. "
Kozevnikov said that competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and intensifying.
He said, "Our goal is ambitious, because we will launch 500 enterprises through the store within three years. "
Meanwhile, the platform will put products from enterprises in the Russian Far East on its shelves.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, professor of Trade Policy Foundation Teaching and Research Section of Plekhanov University of Economics, Russia, said, "This is a political project representing the image of both sides, because the Russian Export Center is a state-owned institution rather than privately owned institution.” "
"I haven’t seen a large amount of highly competitive Russian goods on the market." "
He thought that the project would probably not be implemented, but it would help strengthen the relationship between the two countries.
According to RIA Novosti, Andrey Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Center, said during Eastern Economic Forum that product information from more than 170 Russian enterprises has been published on the largest international wholesale online platform Alibaba.com, and the products can be purchased both in China or in other countries.
Another model of cooperating with the Alibaba Group is a project to train Russian enterprises by experts from Taobao University, the first seminar of which was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Center will organize the participation of Russian enterprises in industry exhibitions and commercial projects at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November this year.
A large exhibition will be held in a 1000-square-meter exhibition hall, which will be the center for holding commercial project activities, agreement signing ceremonies, and promotion conferences, as well as meeting with Chinese enterprise representatives.
Currently, about 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Information Service of the Russian Export Center said, "In addition to agricultural exhibition stands, well will definitely hold business conferences, which will arrange direct contact among entrepreneurs. "
"This is another direction in our efforts to support enterprises and ensure to arrange dozens of special meetings for them. "
In addition, master classes, cooking contests, as well as Russian food tastings cooked by Russian famous chefs and of the "Exploring Russian Food in Shanghai Station" project will be held at the Expo.

Xinhua Commentary: Follow firmly our own path without hesitation
The white paper, China and the World in the New Era, released on September 27th, states: Over the past 70 years, China has achieved great success, and the ultimate reason is that China has found and will continue on the right path – socialism with Chinese characteristics.
It is the choice of history and the choice of the people for China to follow its own development path.
In modern times, China was reduced to poverty and weakness, as well as threatened by domestic strife and foreign aggression, and generations of people with lofty ideals have sought a path to save the country and the people.
However, "They thought it over and tried constitutional monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentary system, a multi-party system, and a presidential system, but all failed. "
It was not until the Communist Party of China and the People’s Republic of China that the Chinese people gradually opened up the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The path China has taken is the path to happiness for the Chinese people, the path to rejuvenation for the Chinese nation, and the path to common development for China and other countries in the world.
Only by following the right path can China run its own affairs well, become the world's second largest economy, contribute the most to the global economic growth, and benefit the world through its own development.
As the white paper says, China’s development path conforms to reality and the requirements of the times, and will look to ever brighter prospects as time passes.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how difficult it is to find the right path; and looking around the world, the Chinese people appreciate the right path even more.
The Chinese know oranges change with their environment, and understand that what is suitable for others may not be suitable for themselves, but only what is suitable for themselves is the best.
It is with this confidence in its path and strategic determination that China has created a globally recognized miracle.
In the twists and turns of mankind’s time on earth, the "theory of the end of history" was popular in the world for a time.
Today, the success of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics declares the end of the "theory of the end of history", the collapse of the "theory of the collapse of China " and the failure of the "theory of the failure of socialism".
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries that they build a prosperous country with a strong and powerful people, has expanded the methods for developing countries to modernize, and provided experience and references for countries and nations who wish to speed up development and maintain their independence to follow a path suitable for their own national conditions.
We live in a diverse and interesting world.
China has always respected the right of all countries to choose a development path suitable for their national conditions.
China doesn’t "import" foreign models, nor does it "export" the Chinese model, and China will unwaveringly follow its own path, maintain its own continuous development, strengthen governance exchanges with other countries, and make its due contributions to jointly realizing good governance.
A Foodworks supermarket owner has been slammed for the “disgraceful” sacking by text of a 66-year-old female worker after the Fair Work Commission found he dismissed her because he preferred to hire employees from Asian-speaking backgrounds.
The commission said the treatment by owner Jianbin “Eddie” Wang of Gail Ayton, who had worked at the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, was “grossly unfair” and represented a breach of anti-discrimination laws.
Ms Ayton told the commission that Mr Wang, who took over the store in 2016, had been “trying to get rid of me” because she was not Chinese.
During the case, commission deputy president Peter Sams conducted an internet search and found “a number of past job ­advertisements by Mr Wang on various Chinese Australian job forums”.
These posts listed the job requirements, with one stating “Asian Lady preferred” while another said, “Asian staff preferred”.
A third post said he “more preferred overseas people (sic)”.
Mr Wang sacked Ms Ayton via text message in April this year, later claiming it was due to her ­absences from work and alleged minor cash shortages ranging from $5.10 to $30 from the cash register.
But Mr Sams said Mr Wang’s reasons for sacking Ms Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
She had been absent for just one shift in three years and the “shortages” amounted to a few dollars.
He said Ms Ayton’s dismissal was “not, in truth, related to her conduct or performance”.
“In my view, supported by the job advertisements posted by Mr Wang, the respondent’s real ­motive for dismissing her was Mr Wang’s preference to hire staff of Asian-speaking backgrounds,’’ he said.
“Mr Wang’s conduct constituted a breach of anti-discrimination laws and/or the ­applicant’s dismissal was for an unlawful reason, pursuant to s 772(f) of the (Fair Work) Act. ”
Mr Sams said he did not consider reinstatement appropriate given the “appalling” treatment of Ms Ayton by Mr Wang.
He will consider compensation to be paid to Ms Ayton, who was employed as a casual, earning $26 an hour.
Given the potential breaches of anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation, Mr Sams said he would send his decision and files to the commission general manager to consider whether Mr Wang’s conduct should be referred to other agencies to investigate potential state or commonwealth law breaches.
He said Ms Ayton was not given any opportunity by Mr Wang to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
“In my view, the respondent adopted a hopelessly unfair and biased process to dismiss the ­applicant, whereby Mr Wang ‘waited’ for an opportunity, which he believed would ‘justify’ terminating the employment of the ­applicant,’’ he said. ”
“He was mistaken … the ­respondent’s complete disregard in affording the applicant any natural justice when dismissing her was astounding for its brazen and appallingly perfunctory unfairness. ”
Mr Sams said while the Foodworks store was a small business “it must be bluntly said that no employer with any sense of common decency, would have effected a dismissal in the hopelessly unfair and perfunctory manner admitted to in this case. ”
He said that “it was disgraceful and grossly unfair. ”

Six people deny sale of fake Malaysian birth certificates, case to be heard by the High Court
Six men suspected of forging and selling passports, birth certificates, and identity cards, including an assistant director of the National Register of Names and a Dato-class businessman, went to court on Thursday; the district court judge approved the allegations of anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking in migrants, and the case was referred to the High Court.
Among them, the defense lawyer who originally represented the Dato-class Chinese defendant Li Zhenhua, also a member of the parliament of Jelutong, applied to the judge to withdraw from the trial on behalf of the case, that is, he would no longer be the defendant's representative lawyer, and this was approved in court.
He said that he had been criticized by political opponents for representing the defendant, and that his democratic action party was also implicated.
He emphasized that he was not afraid of any threats, but he did not want to be used by irresponsible entities to stigmatize the DAP and the Pakatan Harapan government or other Pakatan leaders, so the decision was made after careful consideration.
He also said that there was no conflict of interest between the defendant and his role as a member of Parliament, and that he was not legally prohibited from representing any of the defendants, and to date, the defendant Li Zhenhua has not been convicted.
The six defendants were charged in court on September 12 this year, and facing a number of charges against Article 26E of the Anti-Human Trafficking and Anti-Trafficking in Immigration Act and Article 466 of the Criminal Code (forged documents), they all pled not guilty, which were not approved by the court and are pending trial.
On Thursday, two district court judges, Noshaha and Mazlan, approved the prosecution's submission for transferring the six defendants’ charges against the Anti-Human Trafficking and Anti-Trafficking in Immigration Act to the High Court, and as for the allegations of falsification of documents, they will appear in the court on October 3, pending the prosecution's transfer of documents to the defense.
Earlier, the six defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (SOSMA), and thus the judge did not grant bail.
Marching Together with the Motherland - A Sketch of a Certain Parade Unit of the People's Armed Police Force
On a training field for the military parade in this golden autumn, an armed police force formation composed of officers and soldiers with an average height of 1.83m was busy rehearsing.
Their shining bayonets and singular olive green and bright red shoulder boards jointly formed an eye-catching scene.
This journalist recently visited the unit, and deeply felt the armed police officers’ and soldiers’ determination to be loyal guardians of the Party and people forever, as well as their sentiment and their pursuit of “honor first”.
“The dream illuminates a splendid life, and authors an immortal miracle in the new era...” is the song written by the formation members - “Marching Together with the Motherland”.
This song was the motto of every member of the unit.
Qi Xiaoguang, at 1.92m tall, was particularly eye-catching in the formation.
As a flag bearer of the former National Flag Guard of the People's Armed Police, he understood the honors all the more deeply.
The honor of servicemen comes from bitter, difficult training.
As the flag bearer, Qi Xiaoguang always followed high standards and rigorous requirements of training.
He practiced his posture by binding sand bags on his legs, practiced the pace by setting a chronometer, practiced the step length by covering his eyes, and practiced stability in strong winds.
He considers one scene from his career as a flag bearer to be unforgettable.
A heavy rain came all of a sudden during a flag raising ceremony, but none of the tourists who came to watch the ceremony left.
At the moment when the national flag rose, Qi Xiaoguang deeply felt the honor represented by the five-starred Red Flag on his shoulders.
In 2019, Qi Xiaoguang was selected to take part in the military parade as a pacesetter.
The motion standards for the pacesetter and the flag bearer are different.
The marching step frequencies of the flag bearer and the pacesetter have a difference of just over 20 steps, but he still had to make greater efforts in his training, according to Qi Xiaoguang.
The pacesetter is the first in the first row, and directly determines the uniformity of the entire formation.
After intensive training for the military parade began, he practiced kicking his legs every day, and finally succeeded.
During a demo, his accurate step length and pace won successive applause from his teammates.
Almost every officer and soldier in the formation feels the same as Qi Xiaoguang.
The father of soldier Zhu Xudong participated in the military parade in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the New China 20 years ago.
To follow in the steps of his father and become a formation member, he suffered one setback after another, but he never lost heart.
He said, “It is the greatest honor of my life to march across Tian’anmen Square, and accept the inspection of the Party and people as my father did, so I am willing to bear any hardship. ”
When entering the unit’s Honor Room, this journalist first saw an eight-character banner - “Elite Force Keeps the Stability of the Capital”.
Political Commissar Wang Qian from the unit said that all members come from the People's Armed Police Beijing Corps - a group that takes pride in its glorious traditions, and that has taken on many significant tasks, including the founding ceremony of the New China, past National Day celebrations, security at Party National Congresses, anti-terrorist fighting, and stability maintenance in the capital, it has produced many personal and collective heroes, and more than 50 units and individuals have received honorary titles conferred by the State Council, the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China, and the People’s Armed Police Force.

The Gaoligong Tunnel is 34.538 kilometers long and is the longest tunnel of China's railway.
The TV series “Hunting” reproduces the demeanor of front-line police detectives
The criminal investigation TV series “Hunting”, which covers the transnational pursuit of fugitives, was recently filmed at Tianjin Airport, in which actors such as Wang Kai, Wang Ou, and others performed key scenes such as escorting fugitive economic suspects back to China, and the production of which was supported by China Southern Airlines.
The “Hunting” crew filmed the key scene at the airport that best demonstrates the achievements of “Hunting Action” - members of the Hunting team brought fugitives back to China, escorted them off the plane, and signed arrest warrants.
The crew took shots of the tarmac, crossing points, aircraft cabins, and hatch doors, recreating the arduous journey and professional demeanor of China's front-line economic police detectives and hunting heroes who cross over many nations to arrest fugitive criminals.
To complete shooting, the creative team did a lot of early preparatory work and repeatedly confirmed every detail to ensure that the most authentic and striking visual effects could finally be achieved.
It is reported that the TV series will also be filmed in many places abroad.
Vietnam should seize the opportunity for the development of artificial intelligence.
The four criteria used to evaluate and rank the level of cities' readiness for the AI wave include prospects, realization ability, asset base, and development direction.
Singapore ranks first, followed by cities in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an organization expert, responded to the reporter's interview for Maxine Pewana, "When reviewing and evaluating cities such as Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, I found it meaningful.
In general, I believe that Vietnam's future is very bright in light of its high growth rates, strong economic development strategy, and rapid talent building.
I think Vietnam is on the right path and doing a good job.
It is important that Vietnam knows how to use the opportunities brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to promote more economic development. "
Artificial intelligence is completely changing the way people work, communicate, and live.
It brings greater efficiency, but it also generates the threat of exacerbating social, economic, and technological inequality.
However, according to a global study organized by Oliver Wyman, only any city in the world today is ready for the breakthrough brought about by the era of artificial intelligence.

The approximately 800 million tourist trips during the National Day holiday reflects booming demand and supply in Chinese tourism industry
There will be approximate 800 million tourist trips taken in the upcoming “National Day” golden week.
Big data from a number of tourism platforms shows that China's tourism consumption market is booming in terms of both supply and demand.
Ctrip’s National Day tourism report predicts that, based on previous National Day tourism statistics, it is expected that the number of domestic tourist trips during the National Day holidays this year will be close to 800 million, and the number of overseas tourist trips will exceed 7.5 million.
Currently, tourists from more than 500 cities have booked package tours, self-guided tours, customized tours, local entertainment, and other products through the platform in 100 countries and regions.
According to the estimate of the China Tourism Academy, the country received 726 million domestic tourist trips during the National Day holidays last year, a year-on-year increase of 9.43%.
This year’s National Day holiday will not only see a new high in the number of tourists, but also witness consumption upgrade as the "theme" of trips taken.
Ctrip’s report says that the average cost of domestic cross-provincial trips during the National Day holidays is more than RMB 3,000 yuan per person, up from the same period last year, which is because tourists generally choose products with a better user experience, such as higher-rated brand hotels, no-shopping tours, customized small group tours, exclusive vehicles, and exclusive guides.
Booking data from lvmama.com shows a similar trend: "private tours" of less than 10 people in comfortable vehicles for the whole journey for long-distance trips are more popular this year than in previous years.
Data of springtour.com shows that its consumers prefer "leisurely and slow travel" focused on experience, service, and differentiation.
Fliggy’s data indicates the number of tourist bookings in China's fourth-tier cities and below has grown fastest, with a year-on-year growth rate of 30%, reflecting the upgrading of residents' consumption in more regions in China.
Personalization is a major feature of this year's "National Day" golden week tourism.
Ctrip’s data reveal that the vehicle rental road trip orders during the National Day holidays are expected to increase by nearly 60% year on year, and as short-distance self-driving travels to explore surrounding niche routes continue to be touted, those ordering private tours will increase by 155% year on year.
To share happiness has become the main purpose of travel and leisure.
According to Ctrip, 28% of tourists during the National Day holidays are parents and children, 25% are couples, and 23% are colleagues and friends.
As for the age of tourists, those born in the 1980s and 1990s account for more than half of the total.
It is worth noting that even though outbound tourism grew faster in previous golden weeks, this year's inbound tourism market performance is more "eye-catching".
According to Fliggy’s data, the number of people booking inbound cultural and tourism routes during the National Day holidays this year has increased by 42% compared with the same period last year, growing faster than outbound tourism.
An industry analysis shows that while demand is high, the reform of the tourism supply side all over the country provides tourists with more abundant "grand cultural and tourism banquets".
For example, the General Administration of Sport and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism have jointly released the "2019 National Day Golden Week Quality Routes for Sports Tourism", the ongoing 2019 Shanghai Tourism Festival has launched 100 cultural and tourism activities in 7 sectors to attract Chinese and foreign tourists, and as the golden week approaches, Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong, and other provinces have reduced the price or exempt tickets to their scenic spots.
Ctrip’s booking data shows that destinations with unique natural scenery or cultural features in China are the most popular, and that Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xi 'an, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Tianjin will be the most popular domestic destinations.

China may emerge as Australia's largest beef export market.
China faces a severe shortage of pork after the outbreak of African swine fever and is expected to become Australia's largest beef export market, said an animal protein analyst at Rabobank.
After the outbreak, which has led authorities to incinerate the corpses of pigs, Chinese consumers are switching from pork to other animal protein, and in the past year, the number of live pigs in China has halved while the pork price has almost doubled.
China produces and consumes 2/3 of the world's pork.
Chenjun Pan, a senior animal protein analyst at Rabobank China, said that China’s demand for other meats, including beef, has increased; China, the world's largest importer of animal protein, currently accounts for 27% of the world's pork imports and 24% of the world's beef imports.
China's beef imports from Australia increased by 65% in the first half of this year, and China overtook the United States and Japan to become Australia's largest beef importer, said Ms. Pan.
The Chinese government said yesterday that it would release more pork from emergency reserves before celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party of China.

Wang Yi: China Never Absent from Helping Africa Achieve Peace and Security
At Sept. 26, local time, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) open debate on peace and security in Africa at the UN headquarters in New York.
Wang Yi said in his speech that China and African countries are good friends, brothers, and partners.
China has never been absent from helping Africa achieve peace and security.
At the moment, more than 2,000 Chinese peacekeepers are safeguarding peace in five UN missions in Africa.
The Chinese navy has been conducting escort missions in the Gulf of Aden and waters off the Somali coast for more than a decade, escorting over 6,700 ships in more than 1,200 missions.
Wang said that China supports Africa in strengthening its capacity to safeguard peace and security.
In September 2015, President Xi Jinping announced the establishment of the China-UN Peace and Development Fund, which gives priority to supporting peacekeeping, counter-terrorism and sustainable development in Africa; so far, 34 Africa-related projects have been launched through the fund, making it a new platform for trilateral cooperation between China, Africa, and the United Nations.

Listed company repurchase scale hits record high of over 100 billion yuan during the year—Xinhuanet
In order to stabilize company stock price and maintain the company's image, listed companies have frequently repurchased shares in the past two years; through directional repo, collective bidding, and other means, companies hope to send the message that the company's value is underestimated to the market, thereby stabilizing the stock price and enhancing investor confidence.
Data from Oriental Fortune Choice shows that the funds used by listed companies to repurchase shares were 7.9 billion yuan in 2017, and soared to 51 billion yuan in 2018, and since 2019, the total amount of A-share listed companies' repurchase implementation has exceeded 100 billion yuan, setting a new record for the amount of funds for A-share repurchases, and far exceeding previous years.
From the perspective of the purpose of repurchasing, the repurchased shares of companies and the increase in major shareholders seem to be the same, but there are great differences in implementation, capital sources, repurchase purposes, and stock equity.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Maikerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said in an interview with Securities Daily that the Opinions on Supporting Listed Companies to Repurchase Shares, issued in November 2018, has repaired the problems with the previously existing system, such as the narrow scope of share repurchases, complicated decision-making procedures, and inadequate inventory systems, and stated that because listed companies have been encouraged to repurchase shares through policy, the phenomenon of repurchasing shares increased significantly that year.
In January of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange formally issued the Implementation Rules for Listed Companies Repurchasing Shares, the introduction of which has broadened the sources of repurchase funds of listed companies, appropriately simplified implementation procedures, guided and improved governance arrangements, and encouraged all kinds of listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee stock ownership plans.
After the publication of the regulation, share repurchasing by listed companies is applicable in more situations, the repurchase process is simpler, and there is greater enthusiasm for share repurchases.
Buying back shares at a relatively low position is also beneficial to improve the efficiency of capital use for listed companies, so as to increase the level of earnings per share, improve the return on equity, and reduce the pressure on the profitability index of the companies.
Compared with the shareholding increase of major shareholders, it is more meaningful for listed companies to buy back shares, and it also reflects the willingness to conduct active market value management and the abundant cash flow of listed companies.
Xu Yang believes that the main factor in buybacks by the listed companies is the undervaluation of share prices; the share price of companies doesn’t reflect the companies’ future development prospects, so such companies deserve investors' attention, but can’t be invested in blindly, meaning that it is required to focus on the financial reports and the specific operating conditions of such listed companies.
Listed companies with massive buybacks at least show the development confidence and capital strength of the companies.
The buyback enthusiasm of A-share listed companies is heating up, which is normalizing buybacks; data shows that there are nearly a thousand listed companies that have implemented share buybacks this year, and the leading companies in all walks of life have become the main force in the repurchase market.
In the process of its recent disclosure on buyback progress, Ping An stated that the company has already bought back 57.59 million A-shares, accounting for 0.315% of the company's total capital stock by centralized bidding transactions, with RMB 5 billion of total funds paid (excluding transaction costs); the repurchased shares will all be used for the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, including but not limited to the long-term service plan that has been reviewed and approved by the general meeting of shareholders.
Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group has paid RMB 5.792 billion for share repurchases, and recently adjusted the use of repurchased share, which will be changed from the original plan, “all repurchased shares will be used as the stock source for implementation of stock equity incentive in the future” to “it is to repurchase 183 million shares in total, of which 152 million shares can be used as the stock source for implementation of stock equity incentive, and the remaining 30.49 million shares can be used for writing off to reduce registered capital”.
Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group expressed that writing off part of the repurchased shares would be in favor of further increasing the level of earnings per share and effectively improving the return on investment for company shareholders.
The notice on repurchase progress issued by the TCL Group on September 25 showed that TCL Group had repurchased 3.59% of the shares of the company in total, at a total cost of RMB 1.65 billion.
The office of the board of the TCL Group told the reporters of Securities Daily that repurchased shares would be used for the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, equity incentives, or converting corporate bonds issued by listed companies that can be converted into stocks.
The TCL Group has insisted on its existing business strategy, continuously improved its competitiveness, and developed steadily and healthily.
On the basis of confidence in the company’s future development and the maintenance of investor interests, the company plans to repurchase shares of the company using its own funds, self-raised funds, and other means of financing, combined with the performance of the secondary market of the company's shares over the past year, and taking the business condition and financial condition of the company and other factors into consideration.
Yang Delong, chief economist of First Seafront Fund, said that on one hand, listed companies buying back shares could reduce the number of shares circulating in the market and increase the earnings per share of the listed companies, which would be an important factor in favor of the stock price in the secondary market; on the other hand, the listed companies were willing to put up money proactively to repurchase the shares from the stock market for writing off, which greatly boosted market confidence.
The repurchase of domestic listed companies has been increasing in recent years, especially among blue chips, and it is both a good way to boost investor confidence by repurchasing shares and a practice worthy of affirmation and encouragement.
Hu Henghua, member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and Secretary of the Changsha Municipal Party Committee, and the four leaders of construction machinery manufacturing in Hunan Province - Zhan Chunxin, Liang Wengen, He Qinghua, and Liu Feixiang, around the theme "Changsha changes from construction machinery to intelligent manufacturing", have established a “small goal” - build the construction machinery industry cluster to a globally leading level within 3-5 years.
To build a globally leading construction machinery industry cluster in Changsha is, in modern terms, to build an "invincible industry".
As an inland provincial capital city, what gives Changsha the courage to declare such ambitions?
It comes from domineering and abundant strength.
The four Hunan construction machinery enterprises participating in the dialogue are powerful companies whose business covers all fields of sky, earth, sea and land; for example, the light aircraft of Sunward Intelligent, the concrete delivery pump of Zoomlion Heavy Industry, the all-terrain crane of Sany Heavy Industry, and the tunnel shield machine of Railway Construction Heavy Industry, provide "hard power" that are preeminent and unparalleled in the world.
There was a time when China had little say in the field of construction machinery.
But there have been rapid changes over time, and by adhering to the dual strategies of “bring in” and “go out”, alongside the drive provided by the One Belt and One Road Initiative, and by carrying out acquisitions, mergers, plant establishment, and other actions at the same time, Chinese enterprises have become leaders in the global construction machinery industry.
Among them, the output value, market share, sales and other major economic indicators of companies like Sany Heavy Industry, Zoomlion Heavy Industry, Railway Construction Heavy Industry, Sunward Intelligent, and other leading construction machinery enterprises have been significantly ahead of similar enterprises.
This relies on the ability to seize opportunities.
The four leading Hunan construction machinery enterprises are the best in the construction machinery industry cluster in Changsha, and also leaders in the global construction machinery industry.
In the global industrial environment, whoever survives and operates well, has the authority to speak confidently.
In the early years, the global construction machinery industry suffered a bitter winter, and many internationally renowned construction machinery manufacturing enterprises collapsed, but the construction machinery manufacturing enterprises in Changsha went for “winter swim” instead of trying to escape the winter; they pressured themselves, achieved original breakthroughs, and have transitioned from manufacturing to smart manufacturing through the transformation of industrial structure, and so have not only survived, but also become more robust.
This is all thanks to the joint effort of governments and enterprises.
To develop competitive industries requires both enterprises to be aggressive and the government to be proactive.
Changsha has gained the reputation of "the capital of construction machinery" because it has converged the whole industrial chain, both upstream and downstream, created many correlative industrial clusters, and lowered the costs of research, development, manufacturing, and sales for enterprises by optimizing the business environment, improving supporting services, simplifying the approval process, and taking other measures to streamline administration, delegate powers, strengthen regulation, and improve services.
This good business environment has attracted a large number of construction machinery manufacturing enterprises.
The tide of history has propelled Changsha to the forefront of building the world's leading level of construction machinery, and it is time to act and to make every effort to move ahead.
Whether government, enterprises, or even relevant linked fields including industry, universities, research, and business, all should seize and take advantage of the opportunity, keep firm objectives, strive persistently, and contribute Hunan‘s efforts to the building of a manufacturing powerhouse.
Wang Yi Presided over the Foreign Ministers' Meeting between China and African Members of the United Nations Security Council.
Wang Yi expressed that China and African countries are good brothers and partners.
China has always stood firmly with its African brothers, in the past as it does in the present and will in the future.
We advocate the holding of this Foreign Ministers' Meeting as a specific measure for implementing the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and the leaders of African countries at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in September of last year for enhancing solidarity and cooperation between China and African countries at the Security Council and for pushing the international community to provide better support to Africa to achieve peace and development.
Wang Yi said that Africa is China’s most important and most trusted partner.
As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China’s vote on the Security Council has always belonged to the world’s many developing countries, including African countries.
Faced with the new situation, China is ready to work with African countries on the Security Council to strengthen solidarity and coordination and to safeguard common interests.
The two sides should grow strong through solidarity, resolve disputes through consultation, be self-reliant, and consider development to be the fundamental solution to problems.
The foreign ministers of the African countries who attended the meeting extended their congratulations on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
They said that Africa-China relations are based on equality and mutual respect, and that Africa and China have always been each other's most reliable partners.
Africa appreciates that China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has played an important and positive role in African affairs, effectively promoted the fair and reasonable settlement of African issues, and made great contributions to safeguarding African interests and boosting peace and security in Africa.
At present, Africa faces the threat of terrorism and extremism, and only by addressing these security issues can Africa truly achieve long-term peaceful development.
They expected to further coordinate with China and strengthen solidarity and cooperation on the Security Council.
Wang said that an important consensus was reached at the meeting.
All parties were supportive of safeguarding multilateralism, strengthening the authority and role of the United Nations, upholding the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and opposing unilateralism and bullying; all agreed to enhance mutual support and cooperation between China and Africa in UN and Security Council affairs, and to safeguard the common interests of China, Africa, and other developing countries; furthermore, it was supported by all that African countries should resolve African issues in the African way, and that the UN should provide financial support for independent peace operations in Africa; the concept of “cooperation for development and development for peace” was also supported by all, which will help African countries achieve independent and sustainable development, and all parties at the meeting were firmly committed to safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries, as well as opposing any country creating obstacles for developing countries or depriving them of the right to development.
Qingyang, Gansu Province: Hu sheep provided “experience of eliminating poverty”.
The beauty of September in autumn is draped over the loess plateau.
In the Yimin Breeding Specialized Cooperative in Yima Town, after filling up the food trough in the sheepfold with the last shovelful of forage, Xia Weili, a 58 year old villager, stayed by the trough and watched the white Hu sheep chew carefully.
“Only when Hu sheep eat more forage, when they get fat in autumn and winter, do they sell at a good price. "
Xia Weili said he feeds the sheep “a special nutritious meal” every day, cleans and disinfects regularly, and served them carefully without neglect.
Xia Weili has raised sheep for over 20 years, but it was not until he came to work in the cooperative that he knew how extensive sheep herding used to be.
Xia Weili is from Xialaochi Village, Yima Town, Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His neighbors were all sheep farmers, but they stuck to traditional free-range breeding, so the quality of sheep was poor, and slaughter capacity was low.
Under government guidance, 140 households in poverty in the village joined the cooperative this June, and then everything began to change.
Xia Weili delved into breeding all day long, because he had a belief in his heart.
The people who became shareholders were all poor households, and the sheep were all in trust to the cooperative, so everyone was counting on to deliver good dividends and sell the sheep at a good price.
Thanks to the guidance of technicians, he gradually learned how to carry out epidemic prevention, mastered scientific feeding, and became one of the few “skilled hands” in feeding in the village.
The Yimin Breeding Specialized Cooperative is a standardized cooperative with a total of 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1400 Hu sheep.
Zou Tao, the head of the cooperative, said that there were things to keep in mind both inside and outside the standardized sheep sheds.
“The wool is so thick that it easily breeds bacteria, so Hu sheep can't stay in hot, dark, and damp places, which means sheep sheds must be built in a place surrounded on three sides by ditches, and ventilators also had to be installed for ventilation and heat dissipation. "
Zou Tao said that in order to carry out epidemic prevention, the sheep sheds need to be regularly disinfected by spraying, and that the sheep should be vaccinated three to four times a quarter.
Besides living well, “little sheep” not only need to eat forage mixed with silage corn, wheat straw, alfalfa, and other plants, but also need a wide enough “playground” to stretch their muscles and bones.
The cooperative uses trusteeship to guide local farmers in raising, managing, and uniformly selling well-bred Hu-sheep here, so as to achieve the breeding of improved varieties, scientific handling, standardization, and intensification.
At present, the 140 poor households with shares in the sheep can gain over RMB 6,000 per household every year, among which 4 registered and filed farmers in poverty work in the cooperative.
From “grazing all over the mountain” to “feeding accurately”, from “mating locally” to “artificial insemination”, from “observing body shape and touching bellies” to “doing B-mode ultrasound one by one”…in Qingyang, Gansu Province, mutton sheep breeding not only changes feeding patterns, the mode of “leading enterprise + cooperative + farmer” has also changed the former condition of “breeding sheep on the hillside and selling them in the market”, overcome the weakness, small size and scattered nature of traditional agriculture and animal husbandry, meaning the impoverished condition of these farmers is improving because of modern sheep breeding.
Zou Tao said that if the market price is weak, Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd., a local leading enterprise, feels confident in purchasing the sheep at a guaranteed market price of RMB 27 per kilogram to help farmers absorb market risks.
Xu Jianfeng, General Counsel of Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd., said that the enterprise has driven more and more poor households to practice “sheep breeding” by providing poor households with services such as loan guarantees, supplying breeding sheep, breeding against order, quotation and purchase, and processing and uniform sales.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have achieved stable income increases by “joining in” forage farming, stock breeding, large-scale breeding, slaughter segmentation, and marketing thanks to Zhongsheng Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Development Co., Ltd.
Qingyang City is located in the northern farming pastoral ecozone, and has rich forage resources.
At present, there are 913 large-scale mutton sheep farms and cooperatives in the city, with over 5 million mutton sheep raised, and two processing lines with the capacity to slaughter 1.3 million sheep have been built, so sheep are becoming the “leader” of industry poverty alleviation in the area.
The French Finance Minister said the tax reduction would exceed 10 billion euros in the next year and called on Germany to follow up.
Reuters in Paris on September 26 -- French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros (10.9 billion USD) next year and said that Germany should keep pace with French fiscal stimulus to revive a floundering economy.
When introducing France’s 2020 budget, Bruno Le Maire said that the latest monetary easing measures of the European Central Bank have created an opportunity for those member governments with sufficient finances to increase investment.
The European Central Bank cut interest rates to a record low on September 12 and plans to restart bond purchases to reduce borrowing cost, thus hoping to stimulate economic recovery and push up the inflation rate.
“Low interest rates will not make Europe prosperous, and monetary policy measures are necessary, but not enough,” Bruno Le Maire told reporters.
“Germany needs investment and needs it now, the sooner the better. Don’t wait until the situation gets worse,” he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany many times.
France has implemented a tax reduction of more than 10 billion euros this year, which has greatly boosted France’s economic growth.
The global economy has lost momentum, and the Germany economy, which depends on exports, has borne the brunt.
Bruno Le Maire indicated that the tax burden on French families will be reduced by 9.3 billion euros next year, including deductions from income taxes of 5 billion euros.
In addition, with the gradual implementation of reducing the corporate tax rate from 33.3 percent to 25 percent, the tax burden on enterprises will be reduced by nearly 1 billion euros.

Research: US national healthy eating index increases slightly but challenges remain - http://www.chinanews.com/
www.chinanews.com, September 27 According to www.uschinapress.com, the latest research in the United States reveals a moderate increase in the US government's healthy eating index over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58.
However, on a scale of 100, there is not much to celebrate.
Americans still face "significant challenges" in their diet.
Dr. Fangfang Zhang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts, and one of the authors of the report, said Americans still eat too much food that could lead to heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and the other most common diseases among Americans.
The research was published on September 24th in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
It was based on health surveys of 44,000 adults by the U.S. government between 1999 and 2016.
The authors wrote, "Despite the considerable improvements, significant challenges remain in our diets."
The challenges include getting Americans to limit snacks, hot dogs, beef fat, butter, and other foods that contain saturated fat.
The research found that daily intake of unhealthy fat increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended limit of 10%.
The biggest improvement in the American diet was reduction in sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but it’s still too high.
The authorities say the daily intake of added sugar should be less than 10%.
The researchers thought the reason for the decrease in sugar intake is drinking less sweetened soda, but Dr. Zhang emphasized that sugar is often also added to foods that are not very sweet, such as yogurt and ketchup.
American adults ate slightly more fruits, nuts, oats, and other whole grain foods.
However, the data in 2016 shows that these foods still made up less than 5% of the American diet.
Although people ate slightly less salt and drank less fruit juice, resulting in the intake of low quality carbohydrate, Dr. Zhang said these still accounted for up to 42% of daily calories, and much came from processed white bread and other refined grains.
The research is based on personal health surveys once every two years that ask adults to recall what they ate in the past 24 hours.
The health surveys have put up the question twice every few days since 2003.
The government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend "healthy eating patterns" to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
The Guidelines say people should eat more nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, as well as seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs, and seeds that provide protein.
During the research period, the number of Americans with diabetes has nearly doubled to more than 7%, and the obesity rate has increased over the years of the research - about 70% of American adults are now overweight or obese.
Moreover, heart disease is still the leading cause of death in the United States.
EU promotes strategic partnership with Asia
Ruan Wenping, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, and minister of the Central Ministry of Economic Affairs led a delegation to attend the forum.
According to the close cooperative relationship between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the forum set the theme as "The EU and Asia establish cooperation: building a bridge for a sustainable future".
The forum was held one year after the implementation of the cooperation strategy of the European Union between the two continents.
President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said that enhanced cooperation was part of the above-mentioned proposition because it benefitted the peoples and economies of the countries concerned.
The above-mentioned relationship helped bring stability and prosperity to all parties concerned.
He also believes that the EU wants to convey a message about increasing participation and consolidating the mutually beneficial relationship between Europe and Asia.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is a special guest of the forum and will deliver an important speech at the plenary session.
China's first joint-stock bank financial management subsidiary established: empowering the asset management business with technology
On the 26th, Everbright Financial Co., LTD., a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Everbright Bank, was formally established in Qingdao, and is the first joint-stock bank financial management subsidiary established in China.
Experts said that asset management is an important area for the development of financial technology, and the establishment of financial management subsidiaries by banks is conducive to the use of technology to enhance the asset management business.
In April this year, China Everbright Bank and China Merchants Bank respectively issued announcements that they had been approved by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission to establish a financial management subsidiary.
On September 24, China Everbright Bank announced that China Everbright Financial Management was officially approved for the business.
In the next two days, China Everbright Bank led many joint-stock banks and took the lead in establishing China Everbright Financial Management in Qingdao.
Li Xiaopeng, Chairman of the Everbright Group, said that the Everbright Group will accelerate the pace of innovation, use thinking and the means provided by modern technology, rely on big data, the Internet of things, and cloud computing to improve the coverage, utilization, and penetration of financial capital, and improve customer perceptions, well-being, and security.
By the year 2021, China will establish and improve the "four beams and eight pillars" for the development of fintech, further enhance the technology application capability of the financial industry, realize the in-depth integration and coordinated development of finance and technology, and significantly enhance the people's satisfaction with digital, networked, and intelligent financial products and services.
Zhang Xuyang, Chairman of Everbright Financial Management, explained that Everbright’s asset management platform would use technologies such as intelligent investment consulting, intelligent investment research, and big data to help Everbright Financial Management better judge the macroeconomic situation.
In the future, new technologies such as blockchain will also be applied to grasp the direction and trend of traditional and alternative assets, and then be extended to digital alternative assets.
Dong Ximiao, a specially-appointed researcher of the National Finance and Development Lab, said that under the new competition and co-operation situation facing the asset management industry, fintech companies and asset management institutions must jointly explore new growth paths with asset management technology.
Fintech empowers the asset management industry, which is not only the need for the transformation and development of Fintech itself, but also injects new vitality into the development of the asset management business.
Earlier this year, JD.com launched a new asset management technology system to improve the product development and risk control capabilities of asset management using technology and digital means.
The new system starts with the four major capabilities of product design, sales transactions, asset management, and risk assessment to improve the overall intelligent operation of the asset management industry.
Experts believe that while enhancing asset management capabilities and allowing rich product innovation, asset management technology can also enhance risk prevention capabilities and improve the efficiency of asset management.
Zhang Xuyang said that in the past, the risk preference of customers was easily biased through questionnaires, but now the use of artificial intelligence to conduct user portraiting helps better locate customers, and helps to launch products according to the customer's investment preference, which in turn helps to resolve risk.
"Alternative big data such as e-commerce and Spatio-temporal data can help us better characterize the activity and prosperity of a region and an industry. "
While defusing risks, big data technology will also help improve risk control, Zhang said.
There is a new record for the deepest railway tunnel shaft in China
China News Service, Baoshan, September 27th (Zhang Weiming, Xu Weiguo, Zhou Jingbo) After more than 1200 days and nights, digging and track-laying for the Dali-Ruili Railway’s No. 1 Shaft of Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel was completed on September 27th, at which point the shaft extended 762.59m under the surface, breaking the record for the deepest railway tunnel shaft in China, and this record was set despite the risk of a massive water burst.
The Dali-Ruili Railway’s Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel, located in Yunnan province is 34.5 km long in total, runs across the Gaoligong Mountains from the west bank of Nujiang River, and is the longest two-lane single-tube tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel runs through 19 fault zones and has a maximum depth of 1,155m, and due to the fact that it covers nearly all possible unfavorable geological conditions and major risks for tunnel construction, the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel is called the "geological museum" of tunnel construction.
The shaft is the most important service gallery for the Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel, and is crucial to important tasks, including achieving "short tunneling time for long tunnels" work planes, and serving as permanent ventilation for later railway operations.
The successful excavation of No. 1 Shaft to the bottom marks the beginning of horizontal tunnel construction for Gaoligong Mountain Tunnel; when the shaft station is excavated and equipment is replaced, there will be 4 additional working planes at the bottom to speed the excavation of the main tunnel.
"The Shaft is entirely inside a granite formation, and there are many fractures in the granite formation, so there is no way to prevent the continuous flow of water from the top to the bottom, which is to say that essentially, the water pressure is the same as the depth of the shaft. "
Chief Engineer Si Jingzhao of the China Railway Tunnel Group Dali-Ruili Railway Project Team told this reporter that during shaft construction, sudden muddy water bursts were a common occurrence, causing the risk of collapse and other dangers, and that the builder invited experts to the site to diagnose and discuss countermeasures more than 20 times.
“The maximum water burst in the shaft is higher than 300 m3/h, and the shaft bottom is deeper than 700m, which means that the water pressure is equivalent to that 700m under the sea. "
Si said, "If we didn’t pump out and drain the water in time, the shaft would be flooded by 10 meters of water in an hour, which meant we spend almost 85% of our time in handling the water and just 15% actually tunneling. "
To overcome geological challenges at No. 1 Shaft, such as longitudinal joint development in the surrounding rock, sudden muddy water bursts, and water-rich granite, systematic water control measures which combined "water exploring, grouting, and tunneling" were adopted during tunnel construction to reduce construction risks.
After several improvements, a mechanized construction line including an excavation system, debris hauling system, suspension system, and winch hoisting system was developed for the construction of No. 1 Shaft to ensure whole-process mechanized operation including drilling, blasting, debris hauling, formwork installation, and concrete pouring, which accelerated the construction progress.
Finally, after more than 1200 days and nights, the shaft was successfully tunneled to a depth of 762.59m.

Survey on consumption in “National Day” holiday: More diverse tourism modes are becoming the foremost choice.
As the National Day holiday approaches, people's holiday plans are gradually being finalized.
This reporter of Securities Daily investigated the arrangements for the “National Day” holiday in Wechat Moments in the last few days, and according to feedback from nearly 20 people, although plans differ, “tourism + consumption” has become the key word for the “National Day” holiday.
Specifically speaking, from the feedback obtained by the reporter of Securities Daily, over half of the people are choosing to travel.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said “he plans to travel to Shanghai with his family during the ‘National Day’ holiday, first to Disneyland, and then travel to the surrounding cities”; Miss Li from Beijing chose to travel to Taiwan in our country, “My family of three plans to leave on September 28 to take 10-day tour around Taiwan”; Miss Ma from Chongqing plans to travel abroad, with Singapore as the destination; Mr. Zhang from Hebei plans a road trip with his family, and said that, “My daughter is less than 2 years old, so it isn’t convenient to go on a long journey, which is why we plan to drive to Shandong to spend a few days by the seaside ”.
The Report on Residents Travel and Travel Trends in 2019 National Day Golden Week, jointly issued by Tongcheng Yilong and LY recently showed that the consumption upgrading trend of journeys and travel in the three subdivisions including trips, residence, and travel during the National Day Golden Week of this year is evident.
The rate of travelling by air and high-speed rail has increased steadily, and the proportion of the demand for starred hotels and individualized non-standard accommodation has increased.
The Report on Residents Travel and Travel Trends in 2019 National Day Golden Week issued by Meituan on September 23 showed that travel consumption continued to be vigorous, and that “eating, living, travelling, and playing” diversification and upgrades are appearing.
Much more young people prefer high-quality and unique experiences, and the popularity of cultural tourism, night tourism, and other tourism continues to rise rapidly.
Besides tourism, all kinds of demand for consumption were also stimulated during the National Day holiday.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the reporter of Securities Daily, “My main plan in this year’s ‘National Day’ holiday is to buy a car. "
The staff in a Beijing automobile brand 4S shop told the reporter of Securities Daily that generally speaking, September and October every year are known as the golden period of car sales.
During National Day, the shop holds many activities, such as prize drawings and discounts for visiting the shop.
In addition, many brands have launched new car models recently and it is expected that the new cars will significantly increase sales volume.
Amidst the trend of consumption upgrading, people pay more attention to meeting the demands for “the spirit”, and the ratio of the service consumption in culture, education, and other aspects is increasing.
“Since the birth our child, culture and education consumption have become the major portion of our family’s consumption expenditure”, Miss Du, who lives in Beijing, said.
This year’s ‘National Day’ holiday is well arranged, we will go to 'visit' planetarium, children's theater, meet with a few families to go to Elk Museum to put up tent for camping on the weekend, and also arrange some experience classes. "
In the opinions of some insiders, theoretically, residents' consumption upgrading has evolved from survival consumption to development consumption, and finally to enjoyment consumption, of which a large amount of enjoyment consumption falls under service consumption.
With the continuous development of our country’s economy and society, and the rising of residents' income level, people have higher demands for “spiritual” consumption, and traveling and taking trips is a good way to meet that demand.
In particular, people have enough time during the long “National Day” holiday, so people are more willing to travel and consume, which not only meet the demand for “spiritual” consumption, but also reflect the upgrading of residents' consumption.
I started feeling lonely in the afternoon, and I didn’t want to go out... I’m still not used to the fact that children aren’t around.
Pulling myself together, I said to my dog Nana, "Mom's taking you out.”
I wrote down a few things I had to do when I left home; my Type A blood personality traits were getting stronger, and I felt awkward as well.
Get a suit, buy nutritional grain, pay my bills, and buy sashimi and snacks for Nana.
All these were the reasons to go out.
I said to sister Aiqiang on the phone just now that without Nana, I wouldn’t even have the excuse to buy snacks.
Laughing perfunctorily, she said her child was calling and hung up.
Nana hopped up to the passenger seat and lay restfully, she knew she gets carsick, and she was terrified, but she didn’t want to be without me.
My husband, Boau, returned unusually early.
He said that the salmon with avocado salad was quite delicious, and then went to the bedroom lying on the bed watching TV.
I looked at the clock on the wall, and it was exactly 7 o'clock; in the land of the sunrise, the sun sets early, and it was dark already.
My Moments was full of pictures of bright moon, and I realized that today was Mid-Autumn Festival.
I washed a bunch of grapes from a friend and left half of them for Boau, put the rest in my favorite flower bowl, and took them outside to admire the moon.
Sitting on the ground with Nana, I ate the grapes and she ate the skins, and I spat the seeds away.
The moon was hiding in the clouds, but fortunately, the clouds were moving and the moon flickered, light and then dark, slightly piercing my eyes.
My mind was flooded with all kinds of poems about the moon, but the only verse I could remember clearly was this one: every fifteenth day of the lunar calendar month, there is a full moon at night, and with moonlight shining on the barriers, the moon had just appeared in the sky, and the people were looking up.
Maybe we think too much about the moon, and for this moment, the sentence of "the things of god belong to god, and the things of Caesar to Caesar" feels perfect.
The moonlight belongs to the moon, your mood to yourself.
After eating the grapes, I felt the chill of the cold moon.
Curling up at my feet, Nana snored slightly, so I got up and spread Nana's little blanket over the edge of her little nest, after which she happily laid down on it.
I opened the door and shouted: is the bath water ready?
I couldn’t see the moon from the bathroom window, I could only feel it, so I turned off the bathroom light and opened the glass window.
No moon cakes, no wine.

Applicants should satisfy with the following requirements: complete 12 years of formal compulsory education and obtain a high school graduation certificate; take the unified examination and the college entrance examination and score 70% or above (if the total score is 750, a score of more than 525 is required) including the results of two languages and math or natural science, and other requirements.
However, the requirements of specific majors for the college entrance examination results are different.
For example, to apply for medical science, oral medicine, veterinary medicine, pharmacology, and other majors, the score of the college entrance examination should be 80% of the total or above, including at least two subjects in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, or the applicant should take the science subject synthesis examination; to apply for a law-related major, the score of the college entrance examination should be 80% of the total score or above, including at least two subjects of foreign language, history, geography, or the applicant should take the liberal art synthetic examination.

In the UK, for example, the University of Cambridge, the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester, and other colleges and universities accept applications from Chinese students based on their college entrance examination scores.

The defendant Zhou X was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years with a probation of 4 years and a fine of RMB 3,000, and was ordered to pay RMB 15,420 in ecological environment and resources damages.
The investigation found that from late January 2014, Zhou X had set an electrified net at the cliff and hunted more than 20 wild animals, including goral, muntjak, and tufted deer.
Goral is a Chinese grade-two endangered protected wild animal, while muntjak and tufted deer are listed in the National Terrestrial Wildlife Protection Directory.
During the trial, Zhou X admitted the facts of his offense and behavior, and was willing to bear the collateral civil liability.
However, considering the poor economic conditions of Zhou X’s family, the local village committee, the forest station, and Zhou X reached an agreement on compensation for ecological damages with by labor substitution through mediation by the People’s Procuratorate of Baokang County: Zhou X would engage in macaque taming and care, mountain patrol free of charge, and forest protection for one year at the village macaque reserve, and would provide philanthropic labor services to compensate for biological repair expenses.
The court acknowledged the suggestion of the procurator and agreed that while under probation, Zhou X should actively perform his obligations to “compensate the biological repair expenses with labor substitution”.
So far, Zhou X has engaged in volunteer labor for 3 months, actively patrolled the mountain, and behaved well for 3 months.
In recent years, the People’s Procuratorate of Baokang County has organically fused the procuratorate function and social governance behavior, scientifically employed procuratorate suggestions, surveillance supervision, litigation supervision, and other supervision methods, and also applied judicial means to minimize the impact of offensive behaviors on the biological environment.
The United Nations Issues the “Champions of the Earth Award” to Ant Forest
Against the backdrop of warm applause and magnificent music, Xu Di, the project leader of the "Ant Forest", and Shen Junliang, user representative, walked to the podium to receive the 2019 UN “Champions of the Earth Award” from the host.
The 2019 UN “Champions of the Earth” award ceremony was held in New York, USA, on September 26th, and the Ant Forest project, which allows hundreds of millions of people to take part in environmental action through a mobile applet, won the award under the “Inspiration and Action” category.
The winners were announced a week ago by the United Nations Environment Programs at its headquarters in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, but the ceremony was still very exciting.
Ms. Inger Andersen, the Executive Director of United Nations Environment Programs, said during an interview with Xinhua News Agency that "Ant Forest" is an exciting innovation that will enable hundreds of millions of people to take action to understand the environmental challenges faced by the human beings and what can we do for the environment.
It uses technology to connect people and the environment, so that every individual can participate in protecting the earth, and it will have a huge impact.
"Ant Forest" was launched by China Ant Financial Services Group (Ant Financial for short) on Alipay in August 2016, where it allows users to accumulate "green energy" by logging their daily green trips, paying utilities online, and other low-carbon activities, and also to "plant trees" on their mobile phones.
For every virtual tree a user acquires, Ant Forest and its non-profit partners will plant a real tree on desertified land.
By August this year, 500 million users of "Ant Forest" had reduced their carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in desertified areas.
Costa Rica also received the “Champions of the Earth Award” due to their national environment protection efforts, and Carlos Alvarado, Costa Rica’s President, who was there to accept the award, praised "Ant Forest" for its contribution and "impressive ability to inspire so many people to take part in green initiatives."
Jing Xiandong, Chairman and CEO of Ant Financial, said that the “Champions of the Earth Award” is positive recognition for the "Ant Forest" project.
Its technology and open platform that make it possible for everyone to participate in low-carbon life, and the honor for the award belongs to every participant.
Jing said "Ant Forest" had affected 500 million people in the past 3 years, and its goal in the next 3 years is to inspire 1 billion people worldwide to take part in low-carbon activities.
Besides fighting desertification and environmental protection, they are also exploring ways to help farmers create more income from green mountains and rivers.
Apart from providing jobs planting trees, the company hopes to help farmers increase their income through agricultural development projects and e-commerce platforms.
The environmental protection public welfare model based on digital technology created by "Ant Forest" has also been successfully exported to other countries.
In June this year, GCash, the largest digital wallet in the Philippines, launched a Philippine version of "Ant Forest" to encourage users to better protect the environment by living a low-carbon life.
It is said that GCash plans to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within a year of the launch of the project in partnership with the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources and Environment Protection Public Welfare Organizations.
The “Champions of the Earth Award” is the UN's highest honor in the area of environmental protection.
"Ant Forest" follows the Builders of Saihanba Forest Farm in China and the Green Rural Revival Program of Zhejiang in China as the third green innovation protection project from China to receive the “Inspiration and Action” award for three consecutive years.
Economic and Trade Friction Affects U.S. Economic "Report Card".
Due to the sharp decline in private sector investment and exports, the growth rate of U.S. GDP in the second quarter of the year has slowed significantly compared to the previous quarter, the United States economic “report card” showed.
Analysts point out that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they brought about are the main reasons for the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on the 26th showed that U.S. GDP grew at an annual rate of 2% in the second quarter, which was the same as the previously revised data, but significantly lower than the 3.1% in the first quarter.
Data showed that consumption growth was the main factor supporting U.S. economic growth in the second quarter.
Personal consumption expenditures, which accounted for about 70% of the U.S. economy, increased by 4.6% quarter-on-quarter, driving 3.03 percentage points of economic growth.
In addition, government consumption expenditure and investment drove economic growth by 0.82 percent.
However, private sector investment in the second quarter fell by 6.3% from the previous quarter, dragging down economic growth by 1.16 percent; exports fell by 5.7% from the previous quarter, and net exports dragged down economic growth by 0.68 percent.
Barry Knapp, managing partner of the Ironside Macroeconomics Consulting Company in the United States, said that instead of maintaining last year's growth, private sector investment had fallen sharply as business confidence was hit by trade frictions and rising uncertainty.
Mr. Knapp believes that U.S. corporate capital spending is expected to remain on a downward trend next year amid policy uncertainty.
While consumption growth provided strong support to the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are growing signs that trade frictions and the uncertainty they brought have affected consumer confidence and hurt the outlook for U.S. consumption, analysts said.
In a recent survey, 38 percent of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, which was the highest percentage in a year and a half, said Richard Curtin, an economics professor at the university of Michigan who led the survey.
Regarding the future trend of the U.S. economy, analysts generally believe that the U.S. economy will continue to slow down.
However, some experts said that if economic and trade frictions are eased, the performance of the U.S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve.
Karin Birch, global economist of the British Economist Think Tank, predicts that the U.S. economy will continue its gradual downward trend this year, and the growth rate will drop to a lower level than that in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, Moody's Chief Economist, predicts that the U.S. economy will grow 2.3 percent this year and 1.6 percent next year, assuming economic frictions don't escalate.
Ellen Hatzen, an investment manager at Putnam Investments, said the biggest concern for businesses is the trade dispute and the uncertainty it brought about, but if economic and trade disputes can be resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced, and the performance of the industrial sector will be much better.
Matt Merley, stock strategist at Miller-Tabuck Asset Management, said that economic and trade frictions are still the "primary problem" and the main reason for the large fluctuations in the U.S. capital market this year, and whether trade frictions can be properly resolved will be the key to the direction of U.S. capital markets for the rest of the year.
Ningxia Becomes first in the Nation to Establish Annual 10-day Common Parental Leave for Parents of Children Aged 0-3
Safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of women is an expression of respecting and protecting human rights, and also represents an important indicator of social civilization and progress.
On September 27, the Regulation of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region on the Protection of Women’s Rights and Interests was adopted by an overwhelming vote at the Fifteenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Twelfth People’s Congress of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
This is Ningxia’s first provincial-level regulation formulated and decreed by an autonomous region to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of women in a comprehensive and systematic manner, and it will be formally implemented as of November 1, 2019.
According to reports, this Regulation is an amendment to the Measures of Ningxia to Implement the Law of the Peoples Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women adopted in 2007, and contains 65 articles in 9 chapters, including General Provisions, Political Rights, Cultural and Educational Rights, Labor and Social Security Rights, Property Rights, Personal Rights, Marital and Family Rights, Legal Liabilities, and Supplementary Provisions.
In the Regulation, Ningxia encourages an exploratory implementation of parental leave for both parents, which is the first of its kind nationwide.
This April, the General Office of the State Council issued the Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Development of Care Services for Infants Aged Below 3, which describes common childcare by both parents.
When amending the Regulation, Ningxia introduced an innovative concept: “encouraging employers to provide an annual 10-day common parental leave for the couple respectively during the period when the infant is aged 0-3, provided that the couple has an infant in line with laws and regulations”.
At the same time, the Regulation highlights the fight against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulation adopts the latest legislative results in the personality rights section of China’s civil code, and stipulates in detail what constitutes sexual harassment, as well as anti-sexual harassment bodies and mechanisms.
Article 44 of the Regulation expressly forbids sexual assault events against female minors that frequently occur, and requires educational institutions to conduct the related education, protection, and prevention work, making Regulation has become a new benchmark among local legislation for protecting female minors.
As to females’ right to know and to dispose of common properties in the marriage and family, Article 35 expressly stipulates their right to know and to dispose of common properties, and also stipulates the obligations of property registration agencies and related entities, providing a solid institution support for females to protect their rights.
Besides, when addressing sexual discrimination in employment, which is a hotly debated issue in society, Article 26 not only prohibits direct discrimination, but also forbids indirect discrimination, and moreover adopts the latest joint interview practices and strengthens the penalty against the offensive sexually discriminating behavior to safeguard appropriate rights and interests of women.
In recent years, the Women’s Federation of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has worked together with the police, procuratorates, courts, justices, civil affairs, and other authorities to introduce and promote social professional forces to mediate marital and family disputes, and has made very significant achievements in this regard.
The Regulation summarizes and upgrades this aspect of law, and several articles of the Regulation encourage the mobilization of social forces and the gathering of social resources to jointly safeguard women’s rights and interests, and requires people’s governments at the county level and above to provide stable institutional support and security through service procurement.
Inner Mongolia Xing’an Yuan Longping Workstation: A Saline-Alkali Tolerant Rice Harvest of over Five Hundred Kilograms
This reporter learned from the Administrative Office of Xing’an Prefecture, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, that there was good news from the Saline-Alkali Tolerant Rice Harvest Evaluation Meeting of the Xing’an Yuan Longping Workstation, which was that the yield per mu broke through five hundred kilograms.
The expert team, consisting of 6 members from the Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yangzhou University, and the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs harvested the “Xing Saline Series” rice in the field.
Through the expert evaluation, on land with a pH value of 8.8 to 9.6 and a salinity of 5% to 6%, the average yield of the saline-alkali tolerant rice is 508.8kg.
Wang Shigang, Executive Director of Xing’an Yuan Longping Workstation, said, “For our next step, we plan to innovate and reform on the basis of this year’s testing, and redevelop and optimize the saline-alkali tolerant rice species to produce better quality and higher yield. "
Lai Yongcai, Leader of the Expert Team and Deputy President and Researcher of Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said, “When the production factors remain unchanged, I believe that the miracle of the saline-alkali tolerant rice will continue on saline-saturated land if we persist in strengthening our scientific and technological research. "
Xing’an Prefecture is within the concentrated poverty-stricken areas in the south of the Greater Khingan Range.
In October 2018, the Yuan Longping Workstation was established in Xing’an Prefecture.
Academician Yuan Long led his expert team to accelerate the introduction and promotion of the latest “saline-alkali tolerant hybrid rice” species and advanced technology, construct a 906-mu rice base in Horqin Right Middle Banner, and helped the local poverty-stricken population to increase its income and harvest through the technical route of testing while simultaneously promoting the technology.
This test harvest of saline-alkali tolerant rice brings hope for upgrading saline-saturated fields with low and medium yields to high yields, and also provides the scientific basis for the planting of rice on saline-saturated land with similar conditions in China.
According to au123.com, after a marathon debate and weeks of protests, New South Wales in Australia passed a bill to decriminalize abortion on September 26th (local time).

Liu Kun, Minister of Finance: 67 state-owned enterprises and financial institutions have transferred state funds of 860.1 billion yuan to enrich the social security fund.
67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, and a total of about 860.1 billion yuan of state-owned capital has been transferred, finance minister Liu Kun said on the 27th.
Liu Kun made the above statement at the deployment meeting of the national transfer of state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, which was jointly held by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the SASAC.
“Transferring some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund is an important measure to reform and improve the basic endowment insurance system; it is a full reflection of the development achievements of state-owned enterprises and the intergenerational equity of the basic endowment insurance system, so it is both a current and long-term policy. "
In 2017, the State Council issued the Implementation Plan for Transferring Part of State-owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Funds, requiring that some central enterprises and some provinces be selected for pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, the preliminary work has achieved positive results.
At the central level, a total of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have transferred in three batches, with a total amount of 860.1 billion yuan transferred from the state.
Among them, the transfer work of the central financial institution that the Ministry of Finance has performed as an investor has been basically completed.
The transfer of central enterprises has reached a certain scale.
At the local level, the preliminary work of the transfer of enterprises has been carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, pilot projects in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had been basically completed, with 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan of state capital transferred respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have successively carried out preparatory work for the transfer, laying a foundation for the next implementation of the project.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the transfer of some state capital from the central and local governments to the social security fund will be fully implemented in 2019 and basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on the same day made specific arrangements for the overall implementation of the work.
The meeting emphasized the need to complete the transfer work pragmatically and efficiently.
“According to the schedule, the transfer work should be basically completed by the end of 2020.
The transfer work is tough job in limited time. "
All regions and departments should carefully organize and make arrangements to ensure that the transfer work is completed as required, solidly advance the work and accurately grasp the content of the transfer policy; strengthen communication and coordination to solve difficult problems in a timely manner, Liu Kun said.
Transferring state-owned assets to enrich social security funds -- starting from “enriching the money bag of social security funds” to provide powerful support for pension security.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple "physical shift" of equity, serves as a "mathematical addition".
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission jointly issued the Notice on Comprehensively Implementing the Work of Transferring a Portion of State-owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Funds to clarify the schedule of transferring state-owned assets to social security funds, that is, the central and local governments transfer of a portion of state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund would be fully implemented in 2019.
After the issue of the document, the Ministry of Finance and other departments also put it into practice quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred its 10% of the stock rights of ICBC and ABC to entirely to the social security fund; the total value of the transfer of the two stock rights exceeded RMB 115 billion.
According to the regulations, the financial investors, social security foundations, and other undertaking entities are endowed with the rights of income, disposal, and the rights to know of the state-owned stock rights.
In the announcement, ICBC and ABC showed that the change in equity would not lead to the change of controlling shareholders and actual controllers of the Banks.
To this point, the author believes that similar equity transfers of state-owned enterprises is not a simple change of ownership, but is an "addition operation" that can stimulate a series of effects.
The first step “addition result” of transferring a portion of state-owned assets to social security can naturally reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises by the whole people, and the development results can be shared by the whole people.
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in China's economy, and their overall profitability is strong and stable.
Among them, leading enterprises even continue to achieve better, bigger, and stronger results.
On July 10, at the executive meeting of the State Council, it was decided to promote the transfer of part of state-owned capital in the round to enrich the social security fund this year.
Then, the Ministry of Finance stated that it would work with relevant departments to promote the transfer of a portion of state-owned capital in the round to enrich social security funds, according to the deployment of the executive meeting of the State Council, to fully reflect the intergenerational equity of the basic endowment insurance system and the nationwide sharing of development achievements of state-owned enterprises.
The second “addition result” of the transfer is to heighten the sustainability of social security fund in China to further consolidate the foundation of the old-age social security system.
With the aging of population, the social security fund in China is under pressure, while as the transferring entities, most of the state-owned assets have the ability to sustainably earn profits and pay dividends, which can not only effectively supplement the social security fund, but also provide a source for the social security fund.
According to the calculation, when every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital are transferred, the deposit ratio of the basic pension insurance of the enterprise can be reduced by 1 percentage point.
The third “addition result” of the transfer is to add a stabilizer for the capital market.
The way to benefit undertaking entities from this transfer is “dividends first, operation as auxiliaries second”.
As a financial investor of state-owned capital, the social security fund genuinely holds obtaining equity dividends as its first priority.
However, as a value investor in the capital market, social security funds are endowed with a powerful capital operation capabilities.
For listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in shareholding will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, which will be beneficial to improving the level of business operation and have a positive impact on listed companies and the capital market.
Meanwhile, social security funds, as the investment benchmark, have increased their shareholding ratio, which is beneficial to further strengthening its influence in the market and acting as a “stabilizer” in the market.
Furthermore, it is also be beneficial to giving full play to the “value discovery” function of institutional investors and guiding investors to invest rationally and carry out value investing.

Iran upgrades nuclear infrastructure, a further step to scale down its commitments to the nuclear deal
China News, Sept. 27 According to a report by Central News Agency, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on the 26th that Iran's use of advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium has once again violated the 2015 nuclear deal.
It is reported that Iran is stepping away from the restrictions of the deal in response to Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018 while he resumes and tightens sanctions against Iran.
Iran has suspended two other commitments to keep a maximum 300 kilograms of uranium enriched to 3.67% in July, and is now making further moves.
Under the atomic accord, Iran is limited to operating around 5,000 older IR-1 centrifuges at Natanz (Natanz) to accumulate uranium, and is only allowed to use a small number of more advanced models for research, not to produce enriched uranium.
Succeeding in developing more advanced centrifuges will enable Iran to enrich uranium rapidly, which will quickly bring the material to weapons-grade levels.
The IAEA reported that, “The agency has confirmed that Iran has developed advanced model 2 and model 3 centrifuges on September 25... They are accumulating or have accumulated enriched uranium. ”
Once the IAEA submitted the report to member states on the 26th, a diplomat responded, "They are very busy (at the Natanz Uranium Enrichment Site). ”

China has risen from being closed and backward to opening up and progress, from lacking food and clothing to being a comprehensively well-off society, and from poverty and weakness to prosperity and strength, and in this, the Chinese nation has ushered in a historic leap from standing up, to getting rich, to becoming strong.

Baidu starts trial operations of its first self-driving taxi team
Baidu declared its official start of trial operations of its self-driving taxi in Changsha yesterday.
The first Robotaxi fleet of 45 "Hongqi EV" taxis, which are jointly developed by Apollo and FAW Hongqi, has begun trial operations on open test roads in Changsha.
From today, Changsha citizens can log on to the Apollo official website and apply to participate, and may win the chance to have a trial ride.
One passenger tried the robot-driven vehicles, and said he could start the vehicle with one tap on the screen placed in front of the passenger seat while seated in the back.
For the safety of passengers, and to meet the requirements of current policies and regulations, trial vehicles are equipped with a safety guard in the driver's seat to maximize passenger’s security.
While driving, the vehicles can intelligently change lanes according to the traffic, can judge the driving state of surrounding vehicles, and can automatically avoid situations such as close overtaking.
Throughout the trip, the passenger screen shows pedestrians, cars, and even some traditional blind areas on the road in real time.
Even if some vehicles are blocking the view, the passenger can still see the change of traffic lights and waiting time in advance, making all traffic conditions clear at a glance.
Driverless cars are things we’ve heard of on TV before, and we thought they would take time to truly be adopted in real life, which is why it's amazing to find them in our lives today.
We really hope they can be available to ordinary people in the future.
In June 2019, Apollo received 45 manned testing licenses issued by the Changsha municipal government.
At present, roads open for self-driving test in Changsha can be found in places such as the Artificial Intelligence Science and Technology Town, Meixi Lake, Yanghu Lake, Dawang Mountain and the High-tech Zone, with a total length of 135 kilometers and a demonstration area of 70 square kilometers, making this currently the intelligent driving demonstration zone with the longest mileage, the largest area, the most complex scenarios, and the most advanced vehicle-road coordination infrastructure in China.
It is estimated that by the end of 2019, the length of trial operation roads of the Apollo Robotaxi fleet in Changsha will be 50 km, and may reach 135km in the first half of 2020.
Lang Ping still feels dissatisfied even after the Women’s Volleyball Team victory: with so many mistakes, it will be very difficult to defeat a powerful rival
On the afternoon of September 27, Beijing Time, the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team went up against the Dutch Women’s Volleyball Team during the ninth round of the 2019 FIVB Volleyball Women’s World Cup, and finally defeated their powerful rival with a score of 3:1, thereby embracing its ninth successive victory at the World Cup.
However, Chief Coach Lang Ping of the Chinese Women’s Volleyball Team still felt dissatisfied with the team’s performance during the third round.
“After the opposing team became more aggressive when serving balls in the third round, some of our team members (first passer) couldn’t resist the powerful attack, so we also made many mistakes. ”
“With so many mistakes, it will be very difficult to defeat a powerful rival. ”
said Lang Ping in an interview after the round.
“We told our members to be devoted, if the first passer is attacked and can’t get in place, we need to adjust and attack our opponent, and we should also fight our opponent by defending our own goal. ”
Lang Ping also commented on the performance of Zhang Changning, noting that when attacks caused her difficulty, Zhang seemed a little nervous, and wanted so much to make a dunk shot that her motions became distorted.
Lang Ping hoped she would be more patient, saying “We will all protect her”.
China’s Development Is An Opportunity, Not A Threat Or Challenge, To The World.
(70 Years of New China) White Paper: China’s Development Is An Opportunity, Not A Threat Or Challenge, To The World.
This white paper states that China’s development is an opportunity, not a threat or challenge, to the world.
As China’s overall national strength and international influence rapidly increases, some people in the world worry that China is bound to seek hegemony as a strong nation, and some people even promote the so-called “China Threat Theory”.
It arises from various factors - cognitive misunderstanding, ingrained prejudice, psychological imbalance caused by growing and declining power, and deliberate misrepresentation for the purpose of safeguarding vested interests.
There cannot be much dispute that all people, Chinese or otherwise, yearn for their country’s prosperity, national rejuvenation, and social happiness.
“China’s development is an opportunity, not a threat or challenge, to the world. ”
The white paper says that China has always worked to stabilize, promote, reinvigorate, and been the greatest contributor to global economic growth through its technological innovation, role which will be ever more prominent in the future.
At present, the robust Chinese economy is becoming increasingly important to global economic growth, which remains sluggish.
From high-speed growth to high-quality development, the Chinese economy is in the midst of transformation marked by accelerating new-type industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, as well as in the midst of profoundly adjusting economic structure, upgrading industry optimization, and constantly emerging new economic growth points.
“According to the research reports by McKinsey Global Institute, by 2040, China, cooperating with other economies, is expected to create a massive economic value of USD 22 trillion to 37 trillion, equivalent to 15%-26% of the global economic aggregate. ”
The white paper emphasizes that both Chinese economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and become deeply integrated.
With more stable economic operations, higher growth quality, and promising growth prospects, China is beneficial to the global economic development in the long run.
It is neither feasible nor detrimental to regard China’s economic development as a “threat” or “challenge” and disconnect China from the world economy by pushing China out of the global industry chain, supply chain, and value chain.
The white paper says that openness to the outside world on all fronts will bring more opportunities to share the “China dividend” with various countries.
To open up more forcefully at a higher level, China unwaveringly implements a win-win strategy of opening up, and with the largest potential consumer market in the world, China has become the most attractive investment destination, and will go further in its efforts to globalize to benefit even more countries.
“Opening up should be bidirectional and win-win, not unidirectional and win-lose.
Only in this way, both parties in the partnership can work together in the longer run. ”
The white paper says that China has shown its commitment to continuously expanding imports, relaxing control over market access, improving business environment, and strengthening the protection of intellectual property rights, and that other countries should also expand openness and take corresponding measures to improve their business environment.
All parties should work together in the same direction to create an open, inclusive, generous, balanced, and win-win development environment, speed up common development, and create a win-win community of common interests.
The white paper also says that China will provide more public goods to the international community.
In the future, China will strive to promote the high-quality construction of the Belt and Road, build up multilateral dialogues and cooperation platforms, actively participate in the international and regional affairs, and provide more foreign aid.
“China has benefited from the international community in development, and in turn, will always contribute to international community by providing more and better public goods. ”
In the written interview with a reporter from Xinhua News Agency recently, Andre Srepniov, the general manager of the Russian Export Center, said that Russia was willing to strengthen the cooperation with China in the field of economy and trade so as to further optimize the export structure and promote the diversification of Russia's exports to China.
Srepniov showed clearly that forestry, machine manufacturing, and the chemical industry account for a large proportion of Russia's exports to China, and at the same time, the export of agricultural products is also very important, including oil products, meat products, and dairy products, as well as cereals, fish and seafood.
Russia's exports of non-raw materials and non-energy products to China have also shown healthy and stable development for the past few years.
When it comes to optimizing Russia's export structure to China, Srepniov said that Russia has set the task of expanding its export of high-tech products to meet the import demand for high-tech products from countries and regions in the world including China.
Next, Russia will perfect financial and non-financial support measures to promote further growth in the number of high-tech enterprises.
In Srepniov’s opinion, Russia is willing to export construction technology and high-tech construction materials to China, and develop cooperation with China in medicine, aerospace manufacture, and other fields.
There is also great potential for cooperation in the field of urban environmental development for Russia and China.
He stressed that, compared with similar products in the West, Russia's products in many fields “have advantages in quality and are competitive in price”.
When it comes to the two countries' goal of achieving a bilateral trade volume of 200 billion U.S. dollars by 2024, Srepniov said that agriculture, machine manufacturing, the chemical industry, forestry, and other fields will play an important role in achieving this goal.
Russia is inclined to advance the supply diversification in these fields and promote the export of highly processed products.
He stressed that Russia is inclined to promote its exporters to enter the global value-added chain, among which China is one of the development directions.
Russian manufacturers in agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas, the chemical industry, and other fields are fully capable of participating in this process.
At present, the two countries need to continue deepening the cooperation between enterprises, “to establish more Russian-Chinese joint ventures, and jointly develop exports to third countries”.
Srepniov expressed that the Russian Export Center is taking various measures and services through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Export-Import Bank to provide support for the export of Russian products to China.
At the same time, the Russian Export Center will continue to deepen cooperation with relevant Chinese departments to promote Russian goods to enter the Chinese market more conveniently and develop new types of products to export to China.

Demonstration blasts President in Egypt, demanding he step down, authorities intend to suppress it with force
Twitter hashtags and social media are vigorously advocating that Egyptians should taking to the streets today to peacefully ask President Sisi to step down.
But the authorities have stated their intention to use force to suppress these demonstrations.
Since then military chief Sisi launched a military coup in 2013 to seize power, such dissent has almost disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest puts participants in extreme danger.
The Guardian reported that Cairo's NGO Egypt Economic and Social Rights Centre has noted that more than 1900 people were arrested since the rare outbreak of protests over the weekend that required Sisi to step down.
Allegations of corruption about Sisi and his family’s pursuit of vanity and waste of money led thousands of people to take to the streets for demonstrations on the 20th.
The Ministry of the Interior of Egypt stated firmly yesterday that it would resolutely respond to any attempt to destabilize the country and would not show mercy.
Downtown Cairo is already heavily guarded, with riot police, security agency vehicles, and plainclothes police everywhere on the streets surrounding Tahrir Square, the tipping point of the Egyptian revolution in 2011.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of important scholars and social elites on the 25th, including Nafah, a professor of political science at Cairo University and a well-known columnist.
He tweeted on the 24th, "I have no doubt that continuing the absolute rule of Sisi will cause disaster. "
"It is in Egypt's interest that he step down immediately. "
Prior to Nafah' s arrest, Hosni, a former spokesman for Egypt's former Military Chief of Staff, Annan, was detained.
Annan was arrested last year after trying to compete with Sisi for the presidency.
Constitutional Party Chairman Davoud was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that at a time when the economic hardships of the poor and the middle class are intensifying, locking up dissidents reflects the government’s instability and vulnerability.
Opposition leader Ayman Nour, who once competed for the presidency, said, "The arrests underscore the regime's disregard for the Egyptian people and how afraid it is. "
"Because he has ruined the economy and faces widespread political oppression, Sisi is trying to send a clear message to the important generals and politicians who may replace him. "
Noir pointed out that given the continued deterioration of the socio-economic situation, the government's high-pressure approach would only increase people's anger.
Now that the barrier of fear has been breached, he expected more people to take to the streets.
The businessman and actor Ali, who is currently in exile in Spain, and was formerly an Egyptian military construction contractor, began uploading a series of videos early this month, and claimed to benefit from government corruption, triggering a small wave of demonstrations in different cities last weekend.
Ali said that his company Amlak received lucrative contracts without going through the legal bidding process, emphasizing the serious corruption of the military and relatives of Sisi, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He deeply regretted his involvement.
Ali claims that he helped Sisi build magnificent palaces and luxury hotels that were in sharp contrast to the current poverty of Egyptians and was not paid.
On Twitter, hashtags such as "Come forward and you are not alone", "Sisi is finished", "Sisi get out", and "Next Friday" have attracted thousands of tweets and retweets, whose content calls for the people to take to the streets in a peaceful manner and ask Sisi to step down.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Amr Waked has nearly 7 million followers on Twitter.
He tweeted in Arabic yesterday: "Sisi is doomed ... He's over, and his supporters are making a big mistake now. "

Many boutiques in Harbor City, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, have few customers.

Law described the challenges faced by Hong Kong's economy as too urgent to wait for the situation to recede.
Therefore, the Government has launched the free training program called the “Special Scheme for Upgrades in the name of Love”.
It is said all those who lost their jobs or were asked to take unpaid leave by their employers since June 1st will have the opportunity to participate in the program as long as they meet the requirements.
Law said that the courses covered a wide range of areas, the most important of which is "vocational skills" training in 19 industries including tourism, retail, and catering, and that there will also be some new courses on "innovative technologies" and cross-industry "general skills".
Yu Peng-chun, the chairman of the Employees Retraining Board, said that all courses are free of charge and the program is expected to support about 10,000 people in need.
Participants who have completed the full-time or part-time course with an attendance rate of 80% will receive a special allowance of HK $4,000 per participant per month.
The training course will last 2 to 3 months and will be offered by about 50 training institutions, will be available since October 3rd to March 31st next year, and each person can sign up for up to 4 courses.
The Government also announced a series of measures to support the tourism industry to tide over the difficulties.

Does exercise tire both the body and the brain?
A study of athletes indicates that the brain also shows signs of fatigue after intense exercise, according to Sputnik.
The study, led by Mathias Pesiglione from the Pitie Salpetriere Hospital in France, showed a weak link between mental and physical work: both require cognitive control of activities.
Mathias Pesiglione explains, “You need to control the process that can force you to stop when your muscles and joints are sore. "
The study was initiated by the French National Institute of Sport, Expertise, and Performance (INSEP).
INSEP’s experts are responsible for guiding athletes in preparation for the Olympics.
Some athletes suffer from overtraining syndrome, a condition in which they feel uncontrollably tired after high-intensity exercise, and their bodies can’t recover, resulting in performance decline.
INSEP put forward this question: Is it partially because of neurological fatigue due to excessive mental work?
The study was published in Current Biology.

Helping Chinese Citizens Be More at Ease as they “Go Out” - An Interview with Cui Aimin, Director of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Wherever you go, the motherland is behind you.
On the 25th, the first Ministry of Foreign Affairs Consul Protection Public interest short film was launched, and the line at the end of the short film resonated with the broad masses of netizens.
Cui Aimin, Director of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency that the short film aims to further make the public feel the sentiment and atmosphere of “diplomacy for the people”, and to make Chinese citizens feel that no matter where they are the world, Chinese diplomats will lend them a helping hand, and provide them with aid, strength, and hope.
There are no trivial matters as far as personal safety overseas is concerned, and we care about every one of our people.
Cui Aimin said that over the past 70 years, the number of Chinese citizens “going out” has increased sharply from “less than one million a year” before reform and opening up to more than 100 million people a year today, and at the same time, the safety of Chinese citizens traveling abroad has become more secure, while the objects of consular protection work and assistance have also expanded from overseas Chinese to include foreign people of Chinese ethnicity, tourists, foreign students, migrant workers, and other groups.
According to statistics, since the 18th CPC National Congress, we have organized and carried out more than 10 major actions to evacuate or transfer overseas Chinese citizens, safely evacuating more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.
About 500,000 cases of assistance were accepted and coordinated, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.
In times of danger, the motherland can take you home; and go wherever you want to go, it is no longer a dream.
By the end of August this year, China had concluded visa exemption agreements with 14 countries covering ordinary passport holders, according to Cui Aimin.
In addition, more and more countries have unilaterally granted visa-free or visa-on-arrival facilities to Chinese citizens.
Thailand, Egypt and other 42 countries and regions have unilaterally granted visa-on-arrival to Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports, while 15 countries and regions, including Indonesia, unilaterally allowed Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports to enter their countries without visas.
In addition to visa-free and visa-on-arrival arrangements, it is becoming more convenient for Chinese citizens to apply for visas, and the procedures are becoming simpler.
By the end of August, China had reached agreements or arrangements with 41 countries to simplify visa procedures.
These include the agreement with the United States, Canada, Israel, and Argentina to issue multiple visas to each other for tourism and business personnel for 10 years, and with the United Kingdom to issue multiple visas to each other for travel, business, and family visits for two years, and so on.
The United Kingdom and Belgium jointly launched a “visa one-stop” service, with France, Italy and Singapore, reducing the visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours, and 24 hours, respectively.
For business people who often go abroad, the APEC business travel card with multiple entries and convenient customs clearance is a good choice.
According to Cui Aimin, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining multiple visas for 16 economies around the Asia-Pacific region for five years, which is of great significance for business people, especially those from private enterprises, as they “go out.”
At present, China ranks first among APEC economies in terms of effective card holders.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocal agreements, promote more countries to adopt visa facilitation measures for Chinese citizens, turn the results of diplomatic work into measures to benefit and facilitate the people, and constantly increase the ‘value' of Chinese passports.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in his speech in the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly on September 25th that Iran can help maintain "safety in the Persian gulf" and ensure the smooth and safe navigation of oil carriers through the Strait of Hormuz, provided all countries enjoy equal rights.
He also emphasized that safety of the region can only be achieved when U.S. forces withdraw from the region.
On September 14th, several drones attacked two Saudi Aramco oil facilities, resulting in a fire.
The United States blamed Iran for the attack and imposed new sanctions upon Iran.
Chairman of Thalys’s increase in shareholding plan completed last year, called on employees to increase their holdings by up to 43%.
On the evening of September 25, Thalys (603716.SH) announced that the company’ s actual controller and chairman, Wen Wei, had increased his holdings of 1054200 shares in total through the Shanghai Stock Exchange’ s collective bidding transaction, accounting for 0.5139% of the company's total share capital,; the total increase added up to RMB 20.0926 million (including stamp taxes, commissions, interest and other transaction costs), and completed his plan to increase his shareholder ownership.
It is reported that before the implementation of this shareholding increase plan, Wen Wei directly held 8.58 million shares of Thalys, accounting for 4.18% of the company's total share capital; the controlling shareholder Tianjin Ruimei Scientific Instrument Corporation Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Tianjin Ruimei") held 82.835 million shares of the company, accounting for 40.06% of the company's total share capital, and Wen Wei holds 66.06% shares of Tianjin Ruimei, who is the actual controller of the company.
It is worth mentioning that this is not the first time that Thalys has offered positive measures.
Since September last year, in a short period of only one year, Thalys has successively introduced measures such as executives' increase in holdings, a proposal of fallback increases in the holdings of the chairman, share repurchases, and equity incentives.
On September 18 last year, Thalys announced that the company's seven senior management personnel, including Liu Wenhao, planned to increase their holding to 390300 shares (accounting for 0.1922% of the company's total share capital), so the total increase added up to 7022900 yuan, and the current shareholding plan has been fully implemented.
Shortly thereafter, Wen Wei, the chairman and actual controller of Thalys, proposed a plan for the employees to increase the company's shareholder ownership, and promised to compensate them himself should any losses occur.
The holding increase period is from October 19 to October 31, 2018, and the maximum limit of the increase of the total holding of the company's shares is not to exceed 150 million yuan, but after the increase, the company's shares must be held continuously for more than 12 months, and the employees had to remain employed at the time of receiving compensation.
This reporter found that during the period of the above-mentioned initiatives to increase employee holdings, the stock price of Thalys was as low as 14.02 yuan and as high as 16.44 yuan, and based on the closing price of Thalys on September 25, the price was 20.02 yuan, while employee holdings increased by up to 42.80% and down to 21.78%.
On January 21 of this year, Thalys once again approved the company's share repurchase plan, announcing that the total amount of funds intended to be used to repurchase shares was not less than 160 million yuan, but not more than 280 million yuan.
On August 8 this year, the company issued the announcement of the "2019 Thalys Restricted Stock Incentive Plan (Draft)" and set very high unlocking performance conditions.
It was shown in the announcement that in 2018, operating income boosted equity incentives, and the growth rates, from 2019 to 2022 for the four fiscal years were not less than 30%, 70%, 120%, and 185% respectively.
Judging from Thalys' s performance in the first half of the year, the company maintained high growth and exceeded the unlocking condition of 30% growth this year.
In the first half of the year, it realized operating income of 842 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 46.50%; net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies was 56.2324 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 16.46%.
Since the 2018 Interim Report, Thalys has achieved a year-on-year growth rate of more than 38% for five consecutive reporting periods, with a maximum growth rate of 59%.
In 2018, the company established a dual-core-driven collaborative development strategy based on the medical inspection intensive operation service (IVD Business), regarding the medical consumables intensive operation service (SPD Business) and the regional inspection center as breakthroughs, and iteratively upgraded on the basis of the advantages of the previous IVD Business to promote the SPD Business.
Relevant personnel at Thalys told reporters that in order to comply with the general trend of medical reform and achieve rapid expansion, the three major businesses of Thalys were steadily advancing.
In the SPD Business field, in January of this year, Thalys announced that it had signed the "Cooperation Agreement for the Construction of Intensive Medical Consumable Operation Platforms and Daily Operation Management Services" with Lingwu People's Hospital and Lingwu Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital.
"In fact, Thalys is vigorously expanding its SPD business to provide medical institutions with sophisticated operating services such as centralized purchases of medical consumables, warehousing management, distribution, and settlement to obtain long-term revenue, "
said the person mentioned above.
On September 17, according to the Zhejiang Government Procurement Service Information Platform of the Zhejiang Government Procurement Network announcement, Thalys won the auction of a "medical consumables (including reagents) in-hospital logistics extension service project" from Shao Yifu Hospital of the medical college of Zhejiang University .
Pharmaceutical industry analysts pointed out that this bid was very profitable, because Shao Yifu Hospital is the first public hospital in mainland China to pass the Joint Commission International (JCI); the smooth implementation of this project in the future is also an important development opportunity for the hospital.
According to its analysis, previously, Thalys’s business areas basically covered all the provinces in the country through regional expansion, national strategic cooperation, and channel mergers and acquisitions.
Winning the bid of Shao Yifu Hospital means acquiring another city in Zhejiang, and they should continue to replicate this model in different hospitals to enhance the company's competitiveness in the East China market.
In addition, this year, Thalys is also deploying in emerging areas such as industrial marijuana and blockchain technology.

The British oil tanker Stena Impero, held by Iran for more than two months was, released and set off from Bandar Abbas Port, Iran, on the morning of September 27th for international waters.
In the middle of last month, the authorities in Gibraltar, a British overseas territory, released an Iranian oil tanker that had been held for more than a month.
According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, at 9 am September 27th (local time), the British oil tanker Stena Impero left Bandar Abbas Port for the international waters of the Persian Gulf.
Iran’s Hormozgan Port and Maritime Organization confirmed that the tanker's commander and crew had made formal and written commitments that, despite the fact that it was impounded, they had no claims for compensation.
Stena Bulk, the Swedish owner of Stena Impero, also said the tanker was sailing from Bandar Abbas Port.
Moreover, Refinitiv's vessel tracking data also found that the tanker began moving on September 27th and left Bandar Abbas Port.
The British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero was impounded by Iran in July.
The Company’s spokesman said the tanker was preparing to leave Bandar Abbas Port.
Two weeks after Britain impounded an Iranian tanker in the sea area of Gibraltar, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps detained the tanker, Stena Impero, in the strait of Hormuz waterway.
The tanker was released in August.
Earlier this week, the Iranian government spokesman said all legal procedures needed to release the Stena Impero had been handled.
However, Iran says the investigation is ongoing.
Several Iranian media also posted videos of the tanker's departure.
On July 19th, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Navy detained a British oil tanker, the Stena Impero, in Iranian waters in the strait of Hormuz, and escorted it to Bandar Abbas Port.
The Iranian oil tanker Grace 1, which was being held, left the waters of Gibraltar.
On July 4th, the authorities in Gibraltar, a British overseas territory, seized the oil tanker Grace 1, which was carrying Iranian crude oil in the strait of Gibraltar, on suspicion of transporting oil to Syria in violation of EU sanctions.
One month later, on August 15th, the authorities in Gibraltar announced the release of the Grace 1.
This afternoon, a special conference on the review and rectification of thematic education of undergraduate universities and colleges in the province was held in Changsha.
Wu Lan, deputy secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, emphasized that it was necessary to improve political standing, strengthen political responsibilities, take a rigorous approach to problems to review and rectification, and promote the high-quality development of party building, ideology, and reform and development in universities and colleges through the effectiveness of thematic education.
Wu Lan fully affirmed the preliminary results achieved by the undergraduate colleges and universities in the second batch of thematic education.
She pointed out that carrying out the thematic education of “remaining true to our original aspirations and keeping our mission firmly in mind” was a major deployment made by the Party Central Committee; all undergraduate colleges and universities must thoroughly study and implement the spirit of the important speech made by general secretary Xi Jinping on carrying out the theme of “remaining true to our original aspiration and keeping our mission firmly in mind”.
We should carefully complete the prescribed actions of the thematic education, especially the series of issues identified through solid rectification, and coordinate the reform and development of the school from the political height of enhancing the "four consciousnesses", achieving the "two maintenances", and fulfilling the original mission, to achieve the goal of "neglecting neither and improving both".
Wu Lan stressed that we must adhere to the principle that one shall always keep an eye on himself, focus on self-reflection, use the "four comparisons" and "four searches" standards to discover problems and open up paths to seek suggestions from the teachers, students, employees, parents, and all sectors of society, and we should dig deep into the root ideologically and then clarify the direction of our efforts and measures to improve ourselves to come up with practical and effective means to solve difficulties.
It is necessary to adhere to precise force development and strengthen true reforms to truly and thoroughly implement the word "rectification".
It is necessary to do a good job in combining thematic education with "enhancing morality and fostering talents", fully implement responsibility for rectification, and ensure that all the problems are settled so as to achieve the actual results of rectification.
We must adhere to solving both the root cause and the problem itself, improve long-term mechanisms, weave the institutional cage tightly, strengthen the rigid constraints of the system, and ensure that all work is rule-based, and all the relevant people, affairs, and power are truly managed by the system.
We must insist on leaders setting examples: leading cadres should take the lead in arming themselves with theory, in carefully reviewing and rectifying, in strict self-discipline to give play to the role of "key minorities" as a model, and strive to complete the thematic education review and rectification tasks.
The responsible comrades of the Party Committees from five universities including Hunan University and the responsible comrades from relevant provincial offices also made speeches.
The "One AC, One DC", dual UHV projects are put into service
The Zhundong-Wannan ±1,100 kV UHV DC transmission project and the Sutong 1,000 kV UHV AC GIL tunnel project were put into service on the 26th.
These two projects currently boast the world's highest electricity transmission capacity in their respective transmission modes, and enable the China’s energy resource allocation to be optimized to a much greater degree.
Guo Zhi, chief economist of the National Energy Administration, said that the Zhundong-Wannan project is the transmission project with the highest power transmission capacity and the longest transmission distance globally.
Its completion is of great significance in promoting the development of energy bases in Xinjiang and ensuring the power supply in East China.
GIL means gas-insulated transmission line.
And with the highest voltage level and the highest transmission capacity among GIL projects worldwide, the Sutong GIL Tunnel Project has closed the loop of the ‘AC double-loop network’ among the main power grids with the highest voltage level in East China.
The State Grid said that the transmission distance from the Zhundong to Wannan is 3,324 kilometers.
Using conventional technology, more than 15% of all electricity would be lost on the way, but through research and development, the economically feasible transmission distance was raised above 3,000 kilometers.
The Zhundong-Wannan project can transmit 100 million kWh every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which can help to absorb existing new energy sources in Xinjiang.
Assuming full load, the power transmitted annually on this line alone will reach 60 to 85 billion kilowatt hours, which could satisfy more than half of Shanghai's annual electricity consumption.
The Sutong GIL tunnel project is a UHV AC loop project crossing the Yangtze River.
If conventional overhead lines were used to cross the river, two giant iron support towers more than 450 meters in height would need to be built on the Yangtze River, and an artificial island larger than four soccer fields would need to be built for each tower.
State Grid boldly innovated and developed compact UHV AC GIL transmission technology to cross the river through underwater tunnels, thereby avoiding any impact it on this golden waterway.
Both projects are significant leaps forward in China's electrical equipment manufacturing capabilities.
The State Grid has completed "10 AC, 11 DC" UHV projects, and "4 AC, 3 DC" projects are still under construction.
SAFE: China's foreign debt structure continues to improve.
“Overall, China's external debt structure has been continuously optimized and its stability has been enhanced. "
Wang Chunying, spokesman and chief economist of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said on the 27th that the main indicators of China's foreign debt are within the internationally recognized safety line, and that the risk of foreign debt is generally controllable.
Wang Chunying made the remarks in response to a reporter's question when the SAFE released the data of the end of June 2019.
Data shows, by the end of June 2019, the balance of China's full-caliber foreign debt (including local and foreign currencies) was 198 billion US dollars, an increase of 26.3 billion US dollars or 1.3 percent over the end of March 2019, mainly due to the increase in the balance of debt securities.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70% of the increase in China's total foreign debt was driven by the purchase of domestic RMB bonds by non-residents, and the non-residents were mainly medium and long-term investors such as the Central Bank.
At the end of June 2019, the proportion of medium and long-term foreign debt increased by 3 percent compared with the end of March 2019, and the proportion of local currency foreign debt increased by 1 percent compared with the end of March 2019.
Wang said that with the inclusion of China's domestic RMB bonds in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Composite Index in April 2019, international investors have further enhanced their recognition of China's bond market and continued to increase their holdings of domestic RMB bonds.
“China's international balance of payments has maintained an overall balance and the external debt risk is under control. "
This journalist learned on September 27 from the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences that so far, Yunnan has effectively prevented the spread of Spodoptera Frugiperda, which has not broken out over a large area and caused disasters, and the province has also achieved periodical results in prevention and control work.
This January, Spodoptera Frugiperda was first found to have migrated from overseas regions to Jiangcheng County, Puer City, Yunnan Province, and confirmed to have occurred in 129 counties in the province, and had also spread to the hinterland regions of China, thereby posing a direct threat to China’s grain production.
Spodoptera Frugiperda is a major polyphagous agricultural pest insect that originated in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and can migrate over a long distance, and as stated in the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s global warning about this major migratory insect, it is “international, migrant, fulminant, and destructive”.
The insect threatens more than 80 crops, including corn, sugar cane and sorghum, and in cases of heavy feeding, may cause a yield loss of up to 70%.
It is difficult to defend against the insect, and China now has no registered pesticides that can prevent it.
After Spodoptera Frugiperda invaded Yunnan, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences sent Researcher Chen Aidong, who leads the provincial innovation team on collaborative and green control over cross-border agricultural pests under the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, to the front lines along with his team, where they performed a field survey, collected samples, and conducted technical instruction and demonstration.
Chen Aidong’s team first investigated the Spodoptera Frugiperda in respect to its population characteristics, natural enemy insect resources, the characteristics of overseas sources, its population’s migration characteristics, and the toxicity of pesticides and their prevention effect in crop fields.
They actively performed research into and applied green prevention technologies, and achieved over 90% prevention in pilot regions after introducing green new prevention techniques including population monitoring, trapping of adult insects, the scientific use of pesticide, and agricultural measures; at the same time, these measures reduced the use of chemical pesticides, protected natural enemy insect resources and the biological environment, and provided technical support for the province to realize effective control over the outbreaks of Spodoptera Frugiperda and related disasters, as well as offered sustainable treatment.
So far, Yunnan has effectively prevented Spodoptera Frugiperda, which has not broken out over a large area and thus caused a disaster, and the province has made periodical achievements in prevention and control work.
For its next step, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences will mainly investigate the ecological mechanism behind the migration, invasion, and outbreak of the population, and make breakthroughs in biological prevention and green preventive technology systems.
At the same time, they will actively carry out international cooperation and seek to build a key joint laboratory as well as a joint monitoring network and pilot area in overseas regions to enhance the province’s capacity to monitor and issue comprehensive warnings about Spodoptera Frugiperda.

White Paper: China Has Found A Development Path Suited To Its Actual Conditions
Beijing, September 27 (China News Service) The State Council Information Office of the People’s Republic of China released the white paper China and the World in the New Era on September 27.
The white paper says that over the past 70 years, China has been moving forward against all odds and exploring its path to development, and that the Chinese people have opened up the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and achieved remarkable outcomes.
The white paper states that the key to China’s development lies in self-reliance and hard work.
China’s development lies in its down-to-earth spirit of “trading 800 million shirts for one Boeing”, which several generations of Chinese people have carried onward with ceaseless struggle, expended difficult-to-imagine effort, labor, and sweat; it also lies in its responsible spirit of “carrying one’s own burden”, through which China never makes trouble for others, transfers contradictions, buys or sells by force, or loots resources of other countries, neither in adversity or in prosperity; it also lies in its spirit of exploration of “crossing the river while feeling the stones on the bottom”, through which China discovered a development path with Chinese characteristics by adapting to the Chinese situation, drawing lessons from the past, drawing on all the outstanding achievements of human civilization, and making bold trials, rather than following old ways like imperialism and colonialism, nor following western development patterns.
The white paper states that China has developed in connection with the world, that China’s development is a positive force for global peace and development, and that the Chinese path suits China’s national conditions and adapts to demands of the time.
China safeguards world peace with actual deeds.
Over the past 70 years, China has never provoked any war or conflict, nor invaded any other country.
The white paper states that over the past 70 years, China has achieved great success in its development, the root cause of which is that China has found its development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and unwaveringly followed this path.
This path is established according to China’s national conditions and for the purpose of giving top priority to people’s interests, reforming and innovating, pursuing common development in opening up, and fully advancing the law-based governance.
As a large country with complex national conditions, China faced tremendous difficulties in governance, so without centralization and unification, as well as strong leadership, China might split up and bring catastrophe to the world.
The white paper also stated that over the past 70 years, China has overcome various risks and challenges and created a succession of numerous remarkable China miracles.
Especially since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China has made historic achievements and changes in its development, and has made a great leap from independence, to prosperity and strength, and now is closer to the great goal of the Chinese national rejuvenation than ever before.
This development path will lead China toward a promising future as time passes.

The Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center, the Tallest Building In Northern China, Has Been Completed, Creating More Than 100 National Patents
The completion ceremony for the Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center, the tallest building in northern China, was held in Binhai New District, Tianjin on the afternoon of the 26th, marking the success of a synergetic management platform based on high-precision BIM modeling, the building information modeling independently developed by the China Construction Eighth Engineering Division’s Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center Project Department, which won first prize at the AEC Excellence Awards in the field of skyscraper construction.
Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center, located in the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area, covers an area of 390,000 square meters and is 530 meters high, including 4 underground floors and 100 floors above the ground, and it is designed to serve diverse business needs including Grade-A offices, luxury apartments, and five-star plus hotels; upon completion, the project will become an important international landmark building in Tianjin.
The entire project consumed more than 70,000 tons of steel, about 376,000 meters of high-altitude butt welding (equivalent to 42.5x Mount Everest in height) enough welding wire to circle the Earth 40 times, and about 42,000 PCS of steel components, over 50% of which are super standard, including the world’s largest double-barreled oval steel pipe column with single-layer twist of 90°, said the manager in charge of the China Construction Eighth Engineering Division’s Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center Project Department.
The Tianjin Chow Tai Fook project is a steel structure of unprecedented complexity and processing difficulty.
Industry insiders said that the Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center is the first skyscraper project completed or under construction nationwide which comprehensively uses Building Information Modeling (BIM) management.
The project creatively proposed and successfully implemented the “three-total BIM application” model - total involvement, total professional applications, and total process implementation, and developed a synergetic management platform based on high-precision BIM modeling.
During the construction of the Chow Tai Fook project, the project department first built the BIM virtually, and then made scientific and error verifications before any real construction, thereby finding possible construction issues like modification and rework before they occurred, said the person in charge of the project.
In 2017, the BIM innovation achievements of the Chow Tai Fook Financial Center project won the AEC Excellence Awards first prize for construction groups at the Autodesk University & Award Ceremony.
During the construction of the project, the project department created a total of more than 130 national patents.
It’s worth mentioning that the BIM innovation achievements and technological innovations of the Tianjin Chow Tai Fook project not only optimized the complex and overelaborate construction links, they also shortened the construction duration by more than four months and enormously improved safety management.
Recently, the Tianjin Chow Tai Fook Financial Center project also won the International Safety Award (ISA) 2019.

Taiwan Scholars Suggest, Taiwanese Businesses Should Stay Close to the Mainland to Develop Mainstream Industries in an “Age of Uncertainty”
The Taiwan Business Innovation Operation Model Forum 2019 was held in Taipei on the 26th and 27th.
Many representatives of Taiwan businesses and scholars were invited to share their experiences in enterprise transformation, innovation, succession, and market development.
The forum was hosted by the Management Institute in Taipei, and organized by groups including the Capital Securities Corporation and the Outstanding Mainland and Taiwan Business Association.
The two-day meeting was divided into many seminars, covering transformation and upgrading models and business strategies, and more than 100 people attended the meeting.
With growing Sino-US trade friction, Taiwan Businesses are ushering in the “Age of Uncertainty”, said Ch’en Ming Chang, the president of the Management Institute in Taipei.
He believed that Taiwan businesses should keep abreast of the times and stay close to the mainland to develop mainstream industries, especially innovative products related to technology, culture, tourism, and health.
“Taiwan businesses have always valued quality, effectiveness, and delivery. ”
But Ch’en Ming Chang believed that simply following the conditions above is insufficient at present.
He said that Taiwan-funded enterprises must focus on both speed and service, speed up supply chain development, and pay attention to extended services and product life services.
Moreover, Taiwan businesses also need to work hard on “value-added service”.
Hsü Wen T’ang, the representative of Taiwan businesses from Guangdong and the chairman of Yayi Electronics Co., Ltd., said that Yayi Electronics was once ailing due to sudden decline of orders, but the group improved their operating conditions by adjusting structures and activating assets.
After transitioning from traditional electrical appliances to automotive electronic equipment, and entering the smart household appliances industry, the company spent three years before becoming profitable.
Pai Hung Chang, the general manager of Apollo (Zhuhai) Electronics Co., Ltd., suggested providing “one-stop” services to regular customers if there are difficulties in developing new customers.
The reasons why the customers replaced their suppliers are simply poor service, high price, low quality, slow delivery, low variety, and integrity problems, and as suppliers, we should solve these problems while rebuilding our production lines and diversifying our products to become irreplaceable suppliers.
On the 27th, the award ceremony of the “Outstanding Mainland and Taiwan Business Awards 2019”, hosted by Management Institute in Taipei, was held in Taipei.
Lui Cheng Chang, the general manager of Shanghai-based Golden Field, won the “Outstanding Taiwan Business and Cross-Strait Contribution Award”, Economic Daily News reported.
Comments on the new rules are invited: qualification is required for social capital to obtain the right of rural land management
Qualification is required for social capital to obtain the right of rural land management
Opinions are openly being solicited on the Measures for the Administration of Circulation of Rural Land Management Right to supervise the acquisition of land management rights by the circulation of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises
The website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs released an announcement yesterday on requesting public comment on the Measures for the Administration of Circulation of Rural Land Management Right (Draft for Comments)" (hereinafter referred to as "Draft"), to strengthen supervision and risk prevention in the circulation of rural land contracted management rights.
The Draft is open to the public for opinions as of today.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs announced that in order to implement the newly revised Rural Land Contract Law, further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system, and implement "separation of three rights" (the separation of rural land ownership, contract rights, and the right to manage the land), the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the Measures for the Administration of Circulation of Rural Land Contracted Management Right, and formed a Draft for Comments.
A reporter from Beijing Youth Daily learned that the published Draft contains many important amendments for the first time.
The newly revised Rural Land Contract Law defines the scope of land circulation, implements the concept of "separation of three rights", and sets up "rural land contracted management right" and "land management right" respectively, thereby establishing a clear distinction between the transfer, exchange, and transfer of land management rights (lease, subcontract, shareholding or other ways).
To implement the concept of "separation of three rights" and effectively implement the amendments made in the Rural Land Contract Law, and in consideration of the fact that differences exist between the circulation of land management rights and the exchange as well as transfer of rural land contracted management right in terms of parties, procedures, and supervision, the Draft defines the scope of transfer, focusing on the circulation of land management rights, including leasing and shareholding, and as such, the name of the regulation has been changed from "Measures for the Administration of Circulation of Rural Land Contracted Management Right" to " Measures for the Administration of Circulation of Rural Land Management Right".
The transfer and exchange of rural land contracted management rights will be regulated by separate management measures.
The Draft points out that under the "separation of three rights", farmers can only buy shares of the land management right for a certain period of time.
Theoretically, even if bankruptcy liquidation occurs, farmers will only suffer from the risk of losing the right of management, thus it is no longer necessary to stipulate that the contracted land should be returned to the original contractor, which is also in conflict with the Bankruptcy Law.
In order to prevent the risk of farmers losing land, various methods are adopted such as preferred stock, rent before stock, and repurchasing.
Considering that the preferred stock has a more mature theoretical basis in the Company Law, it is suggested that it should be taken as an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of land loss.

The Confucius Institute of the Royal Cambodian Academy of Sciences has unveiled its "China in My Heart" Chinese essay competition
The Chinese essay competition "China in My Heart," themed on the 70th anniversary of new China, was unveiled and awarded at the Confucius Institute of the Royal Cambodian Academy of Sciences on June 26.
Zhong Jifa, a diplomat from the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, Wei Siyu, a representative of the Cambodian-Chinese Council and the President of the Jiangxi Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, presented awards to the honored guests.
According to Chai Keqing, the Chinese dean of the Confucius Institute at the Royal Cambodian Academy of Sciences, the competition has lasted two months. Participants include Cambodian students from junior, middle school (including specialized schools) and universities (including social personnel).
Diplomat Zhong Jifa of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia presented certificates to Lin Weicai, the first prize winner of the university group, and Guo Lina, the first prize winner of the primary and secondary school group.
Chai Keqing said that the entries were organized separately by the university group and the primary and secondary school group. Senior Cambodian-Chinese experts were invited to form an evaluation panel. Through the initial evaluation, re-evaluation, final evaluation and other steps, the university group has finally picked out one first-prize winner, two second-prize winners, three third-prize winners, and ten excellent prize winners.

As announced by the International Atomic Energy Agency（IAEA）on 26th, Iran has started using the advanced centrifuge to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, which further violates the nuclear agreement that has been reached with the great power in the world in 2015.
As reported by the foreign media, IAEA announced that the advanced centrifuge of the Iranian Natanz Nuclear Facility “is accumulating or ready to accumulate the enriched uranium”.
Since the US President Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement and imposed sanctions on Iran in May last year, Iran has been gradually violating the nuclear agreement reached with the world power in 2015.
The agreement regulates that Iran can only use the type IR-1 centrifuge of first generation to extract uranium.
Other signatory countries of this agreement including the UK, China, France, Germany and Russia were trying to remedy it. Yet Europe has been censured repeatedly by Teheran for not doing enough.
On the 25th local time, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi held a discussion with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov at the United Nations headquarters New York City on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. The talk was about pushing forward the signing of a peace treaty between the two countries regarding issues including the ownership over the Northern Territories, called the Southern Kuril Islands in Russia, strengthening political and economic ties and reaching an agreement on Motegi's future visit to Russia, according to a Japanese news agency Kyodo News.
This is Motegi's first discussion with Russia as the top negotiator in the signing of the peace treaty after he was appointed as Japan's foreign minister.
Motegi said that "I would like to hold a discussion regarding issues including promoting the economic activities in the Northern Territories with Russia as soon as possible."
According to the Japanese government, both sides did not go into detail about the territory issue.
The foreign ministers of the two countries developed a plan to be in charge of accelerating the negotiation at the Japan-Russia Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in December 2018.
At the meeting, the two foreign ministers welcomed the progress made in the negotiation on mutual economic activities in tourism and refuse disposal.
When talking about the trial businesses in the tourism industry in October, Motegi said that “I hope that they could be successful and contribute to our next step.”
On top of that, they also confirmed the date for Lavrov to visit Japan during the G20 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting held in Nagoya in November.

Women's volleyball team might successfully defend World Cup championship in advance!
In the match between China and the Netherlands on the 27th, China lost the last set after winning the first two, defeating the Netherlands 3-1 for their ninth consecutive win.
As the World Cup is approaching its end, China's women's volleyball team still need to stay alert in front of the Serbian team, though they are so close to their goal of defending the championship.
In the first two sets, China kept an advantage over the Netherlands with strong performance as usual, establishing its 25-19 and 26-16 victory. But the team struggled in the third set.
Despite the disadvantages, the Netherlands rallied back with aggressive serves, creating huge pressure on China's first pass. The Chinese ladies were anxious to attack, leading to more errors and ultimately losing 21-25.
After the match, Lang Ping pointed out in the interview, "We lost about 8 points because of our errors in the third set."
Of course, one should never underestimate the Netherlands women's volleyball team. China's team was prepared for a tough game. Everything was under Lang Ping's control despite their defeat in one set. "When you play against a strong team, it is perfectly normal to win, to lose, or end up with a five-set match, so I told my team to concentrate," said Lang Ping.
In the fourth set, the players adjusted their conditions effectively. Zhang Changning on her full attacking power scored 8 points in one single set, making a huge contribution to China's victory.
As of now, there are only two rounds of matches remaining from the initial eleven rounds. China is almost grabbing the championship, but the match against the Netherlands did serve as a reminder: the closer they get to the critical moment, the more they need to make every effort.
In another match on the 27th, Russia and USA had a full five-set game. As USA did not manage to win all the three points, there is a chance that China can defend the champion if it could win all the three points in the match against Serbia.
Everything seems to be moving to the direction to China's advantage.
However, Serbia will not give the three points to China that easily, though the six leading Serbian players are all absent this time.
Given the current ranking, it is unlikely that Serbia will get any medal, which means they can go to the game against China with "light packs" and challenge their opponents without any burden, whereas China’s anxiety to win the game might lead to performance inconsistencies.
Moreover, the Serbian substitutes are not to be slaughtered like sacrificial lambs. They fought against the Netherlands line-up of their main players in five sets and reversed the latter's advantage with a 3-2 victory, which certainly says something about their capabilities.
Before the start of the third stage of the tournament, Lang Ping anticipated that her team could have a hard time with the Netherlands and Serbia, "The game in Osaka will be very tough, but we will prepare for it as much as we can, as we always do. "
Now the horn for defending the championship has been sounded, and the game is reaching its climax.
China is stronger than its opponent in terms of ability and the line-up, but the result will depend on whether the ladies can stay calm in the critical, final moment and release all their power on the court.

When delivering a speech at the West Point Military Academy in the US, Stoltenberg said that “For 70 years, the containment and defensive measures that North Atlantic Treaty Organization have taken were all based on the maintenance of the technological superiority”.
He said, but this is an era of change.
Stoltenberg said: “The competitions we encounter will be increasingly fierce.
Therefore, we should make much more efforts to prevent others from surpassing us.”
He said: “Some technologies were developed by the authoritarian states rather than the member states of NATO.
The companies in China are developing the 5th generation networks.
Russia is developing the independent internet and investing heavily in the development of the next generation of weapons, such as the hypersonic missile.
Stoltenberg said, the future safety of NATO “depends on its ability to understand, accept and apply the cutting-edge technologies”.
The love outreach for helping the disable, “a steamer ticket takes me to have a look”, was held at the Orange Island in Changsha on September 24. Over 100 disabled people were invited to cruise “The Star of Juzhou” to enjoy the magnificent scenery of Xiang River and celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China together.
It was the first time for most of the disabled people who joined this activity to go on a cruise.
Zhao Zhengang, who was 56-year-old, is physically disabled. He rarely goes out due to the difficulty in moving.
He said: “Today is my first time to go on a cruise. I am excited about enjoying the magnificent scenery of Xiang River at a short distance and feeling the development of Changsha. It is difficult to forget. “
The volunteers from Fukang Social Service Center in Changsha and Blue Sky Rescue provided meticulous services for the disable.
Especially for those with serious physical disability, volunteers would carry them on the back to go on and off the cruise.
The relevant person in charge at Fukang Social Service Center said, in the past 70 years, the services for the disable in Changsha have kept developing and improving with the support of the Party and Government. More and more disabled people are really becoming the participants, contributors and beneficiaries of the development of social economics. Caring about the disable and services for the disable is also gradually becoming a social consensus.
As the Republic is about to celebrate its 70th anniversary, the flashing spotlights of all kinds of media have refreshed our memories of numerous character images that don't often come to our minds and made them glitter with brilliance again-- it is they, in their days of shining upon us, who bring in the heat and light little by little.
However, a hero walking on the side seems nothing other than an ordinary person like you and me.
Yuan Longping, who has devoted himself to rice research and bred elite varieties that can be used in farming all over the world, makes remarkable contributions so that more than one billion Chinese people would no longer have to fear going hungry, and this old man usually looks like an old farmer who likes to wander in the fields. Nan Rendong, the chief scientist who has taken his great care to put China's "Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope" into service, only did one thing in his whole life. With one man and a cooking pot, he ate cold steamed buns in the deep Guizhou mountains, no different from an old man in the countryside. Zhou Ruchang, the redologist was a village boy who started learning very late, still looks like a child when he is old, and has a thorough knowledge of both western and traditional Chinese culture. With shaggy white hair, he likes to burst into a roar of laughter when his heart is stricken by the academic communication. Qin Yi, a heavyweight film artist, still spends six or seven hours bumping on the plateau every day for rehearsal when she is past 90, she was even willing to play as an unknown old maid in Legend of the Demon Cat.
They, living their own ways, hold a simple, reclusive and unswerving attitude toward life. As long as they are immersed in their favorite undertakings which are elusive to the outsiders but invaluable in their own eyes, they will feel easy to be happy, living in ignorance of social rankings, honors, wealth and interests.
Just like the ground-sweeping monk in the Sutras pavilion of Shaolin Temple as described in Jin Yong's novel, although he has stunning skills in martial art that can shock the world, he is neither pretentious nor haughty, neither happy nor sad.
As for every "ground-sweeping monk" and every single one of the childlike at heart, there lies the commitments to the call of duty that who but myself can do it.
The responsibility of family-country rests not only on the shoulders of heroes but also in the hands of millions of people.
Once, a female middle school student's words went viral on the web: "When the hero passes by, there always are people who have to sit on the roadside to applaud... I don't want to be a hero. I want to be the one sitting on the roadside applauding."
Actually, being a hero and applauding a hero are not in conflicts.
People applauding on the roadside can also deliver their heat and light, and they are also luminous bodies themselves.
Ordinary like you and me, there are always in life some opportunities, some moments and sort of accumulations through long years, which also shape the appearance of heroes.
Zou Bihua, an excellent judge in Shanghai who shouldered the responsibility of carrying out judicial reforms, asked an old clerk from the reception room to tell his own story in public at an annual meeting about how newspapers and letters were delivered and received throughout the year without any mistake. "To do simple things well is not simple." Zou Bihua led the judges in applauding the old clerk--- the likes of "ground-sweeping monk."
It's the appreciations from heroes, one hero is paying tribute to another.
The group-sweeping monk had his Sutra Depository of the Shaolin Temple, Yuan Longping had a vast experimental rice field, Nan Rendong has the "Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope", Qin Yi has a stage, and Zhou Ruchang has a pulpit. Whether you can be a hero depends not only on your own efforts, but also on a good environment and a positive incentive mechanism.
China's "Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope", for example, is now a legend.
In the 1990s, China's scientific community was still struggling, and novelist Liu Cixin had yet to write the Three-Body Problem.
At that time, the most powerful "eye" was Arecibo, a single-aperture radio telescope in the valley of Puerto Rico, which was 350 meters in diameter and was considered to be the world's largest "that couldn't be surpassed."
At that time, China's radio telescope was less than one tenth of its diameter.
Nan Rendong, who was treated with the world-class research facilities and salaries in Japan, insisted on returning to China with his crazy idea: to build a new generation of radio "big telescope" in China to receive more information from outer space!
However, there were many things waiting to be done in China at that time; could it be that a heavy investment of money is poured in only for playing with the stars?
The motherland had confidence in Nan Rendong, and the "Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope" project was launched.
It took 12 years to find the right location and another 9 years to complete the project.
With the 500-meter caliber "Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope," China has completed "the world's exclusive great scientific project" with no precedent to follow.
Therefore, the "Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope" is great, the likes of Nan Rendong are great, tolerance brings respect, the republic is great by looking far and aiming high,
With the country's confidence and goodwill of its people, the likes of Nan Rendong have the opportunity to turn into the soul of the country and the courage of the people.
With youngsters of outstanding capabilities and heroes of grey hairs peacefully walking by and people clapping softly along the streets, a wonderful and harmonious life is promising in such a land.
Garbage classification education was introduced into Jilin kindergartens for the first time
On the 27th, a kindergarten at Jilin city in Jilin province has conducted a garbage classification education class, teaching young children to distinguish between the recyclables and other kinds of garbage.
It is reported that this is the first time that garbage classification was introduced into local educational classes for young children.
A few days ago nine departments of Jilin province have jointly issued the "Working Plan for Promoting the Classification and Disposal of Household Garbage at the Prefecture-Level Cities in Jilin Province."
Based on the pilot project of compulsory classification of household waste in Changchun in 2019, the province has decided to carry out the household waste classification in prefecture-level cities.
Jilin City is one of them.
"We hope through such an activity to realize the effect of young children driving the family and the kindergarten driving the society and advocate the concept of environmental protection,"
said Liu Lijuan, the executive director of Hifaner International Kindergarten where the event was held.
On that day, the head of the kindergarten read out the environmental protection proposal, hoping that garbage classification starts from children.
After the "Low Carbon Babe" dance performance, the children were grouped up to play the garbage sorting games.
The instructor also issued “recyclable” and “other garbage” labels, suggesting that the children stick these labels to the trash containers and record a short video clip when they return home.
Liu Lijuan noted that the kindergarten has kept advocating the concept of low-carbon, green and environmental protection, and opened up regular environmental classes.
Trash cans marked with containable types are also placed at the garbage dumps in the kindergarten.

According to preliminary statistics, the amount of urban household waste generated in Jilin Province in 2018 was around 5,465,200 tons, all of which were sent to household waste disposal sites for treatment.
Among them, 329,200 tons were treated by sanitary landfills, 2.0923 million tons by burning, and 80,100 tons by comprehensive utilization process.
Through years of hard work, every city and county in the province is able to conduct hazard-free treatment for household wastes.
According to the "Working Plan for Promoting the Classification and Disposal of Household Garbage at the Prefecture-Level Cities in Jilin Province” which has been issued, it is clearly required to deepen the works and carry out extensive activities such as bringing garbage classification education going into campus, textbooks and classrooms, strengthen the interactions between students and parents by creating the garbage classification songs, rhymes, comics and short videos, and achieve the effect of "teaching a child, influencing a family, driving a community, and cultivating a new generation."
Figures released on 27 September by Mazda showed that in August, the company sold 117,015 vehicles worldwide.
Sales in China dropped by 21 per cent due to reasons such as a shortage of new vehicles on the market and less reduction in price.
Domestic sales in Japan dropped by 6 per cent. The demand was still limited even before the rise in the consumption tax when people were busy seizing the last chance to purchase vehicles.
Mazda sold 17,729 vehicles in China in August.
Sales have been going down. They were 13 per cent lower in August 2018 than in the same period last year.
The China-exclusive CX-4 SUV also witnessed a fall in sales by 14 per cent.
It has been a long time since CX-4 was launched in 2016. It was no longer a new model.
In the long run, the strategy of providing less reduction in price will reinforce brand values. However, it also had significant impacts on sales.
Mazda sold 27,482 vehicles in the United States with a 7 per cent increase in sales. It has been 14 months since last time its sales grew.
An extra business day in August and Mazda's sales promotion led to a sales growth of vehicles such as CX-5 SUV.
Japan's domestic sales dropped by 6 per cent with only 14,422 vehicles were sold.
The company said that "not as many vehicles were sold as the last time (in 2014)" before the rise in the consumption tax.
Compact cars such as Demio also witnessed a decline in sales.
Chirac's political legacy lives long after he passed away
On the 26th local time, the former President of France Mr. Chirac suddenly passed away at the age of 86.
As the world is changing in a way unseen in a hundred years, the political legacies left by the French politician when he was in power are still worthy of our thumbs-up.
With his very personalized charismatic leadership, Chirac had been France's President for as long as 12 years.
Inheriting the independent diplomatic spirit of Gaullism and standing firm with the European integration, he was the representative personality in pursuit of the "European Dream."
At the same time he was also a strong advocate of the global multi-polarization and multilateralism, a politician with strategic vision.
For this reason, the French media hailed him as "France's outstanding representative in the international arena."
One of Mr. Chirac's memorable political decisions was his opposition of the US-led war in Iraq.
Led by him, France worked together with Germany to stand up to American pressure and took the lead in fighting against the war.
One year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to increased terrorist activities and make the world more dangerous.
Mr. Chirac's warning turned out to be right.
At a time when European integration is going astray and American unilateralism is increasingly rising, Mr. Chirac's strategic thinking and choices in international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly of enlightening significance while we compare the past with the present.
Mr. Chirac was also a French politician who made Chinese people feel quite familiar and friendly.
He was one of the advocates and creators for the "Golden Decade" of Sino-France relations. After he was first elected as the President of France in 1995, he had been promoting the rapid development of Sino-France relations with a politicians' strategic vision.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, ushering in a new stage of bilateral exchanges.
During Mr. Chirac's administration, Sino-France's bilateral trade volume grew rapidly, and cooperations in aviation, nuclear energy and railway transportation made breakthroughs.
The Sino-France Culture Year initiated by Mr. Chirac created a new mode of cultural exchange in the history of two countries.
Chirac's lifelong obsession with Chinese culture was particularly impressive.
According to Chinese diplomats who knew about him, he was able to recite some poems by Li Bai and Du Fu, and even accurately date Chinese bronze wares.
"You've not really been to Egypt without seeing the Pyramids, and not really been to China without seeing the Terracotta Army" -- it was Mr Chirac who said this golden phrase.
"The West is concerned about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth as well as China's political position in the world," Mr. Chirac said in an interview with Xinhua.
"But I have faith in China.
I think with a long history of civilization, China has enough experience of helping itself build and implement the visions and values of harmonious development to shoulder its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time."
I also believe that China's revitalization will release new creative vitality to global civilization and enrich the world's cultures.
Although he has passed away, Mr Chirac's political legacies and enlightenments to the world will live forever.

Legislative Council of Hong Kong pro-establishment politicians issued a joint statement to oppose the Hong Kong-related Act passed by USA
Several pro-establishment politicians in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong issued a joint statement on the 27th to denounce the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 passed by US House Committee on Foreign Affairs.
This statement, jointly signed by 40 pro-establishment politicians, says that the current rights of Hong Kong are conferred by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, including the rights to maintain Hong Kong's status as a free-trade port and separate customs territory, and to trade, cooperate, develop relationships, and sign and implement bilateral and multilateral agreements in various fields such as economics, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, sports, etc. with other countries and regions around the world in the name of “Hong Kong, China.”
These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has been strictly observing international agreements, international rules, laws, and business ethics. Hong Kong is well-known for its great achievements in its trade with different countries and regions and its collaborations in many related fields.
The statement says the approval of the Act by US House Committee on Foreign Affairs is unnecessary. It is nothing but a response to the call of the gang of their delegates in Hong Kong and represents blatant interference in Hong Kong's domestic affairs that helps those delegates in their political bargains.
The pro-establishment politicians expressed their deep disappointments and strong disapproval of this move of the US Congress.
The statement points out that Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the largest source of trade surplus.
Hong Kong has become a good option for American businessmen because of its excellent rule of law, its fair and free business environment, and its incorruptible society.
If the US Congress passes this Act, it will only hurt the interests of Hong Kong and the United States and worsen the China-US relations, which means it will do nothing good to itself or others.
The statement points out that Hong Kong will, as always, unswervingly implement the "One country, Two systems" policy, and continue to enjoy its rights conferred by the Basic Law and to perform its delegated duties effectively.
Just as in the past, Hong Kong is making its contributions to the international community and international business and will continue to do so in the future.
French national parliament is going to discuss the reform of the immigration policy next week, according to Nouvelles D'Europe on the 26th.
French President Emmanuel Macron stated that France cannot "host everyone", but is trying to "host people well" at the same time.
Macron has been trying to take the middle way regarding the immigration issue in order to reduce the tension in the coming debate, according to the report.
Macron said in an interview from the United Nations in New York where he is attending the annual General Assembly that about the immigration policy, he wanted to find a way to kill two birds with one stone and also find a balance between providing humanitarian aid and being efficient.
"France cannot host everyone (of the immigrants) if it wants to host people well", according to Macron.
Macron highlighted four key points of the immigration policy: giving rights to refugees who need protection, helping immigrants fit in more efficiently, accepting and protecting all immigrants who entered France and relocating people who entered France illegally and are not suitable to stay.
Whether or not illegal immigrants should be protected by the State Medical Aid (in French: “Aide Médicale d’Etat”, AME) has been discussed a lot recently.
Macron hopes that the AME system could be assessed and be restricted instead of being abolished.
Leader of France’s far-right Front National (FN) Marine Le Pen tweeted that Macron was just saying empty words after Macron made the announcement.
Gérard Larche, Member of the Les Républicains party and president of the Senate of France, also criticized Macron by saying that he should relax the tension and face reality at the same time when talking about the immigration policy.
Member of the Parti socialiste Boris Vallaud believes that France should "host more and host better" when it comes to the immigration issue. He also criticized Macron for not being serious about this issue.
According to the report, the new Immigration and Asylum Law not only caused the interior disagreement in the ruling party but also had no positive impact on the right opposition party in the year after it was issued.
In the 2020 presidential campaign, the immigration issue will once again become the target for the far-right. Macron has to make some progress in this issue, but is very likely to infuriate the left wing in the Republique en Marche.
According to the report, France's national parliament Assemblée nationale is going have a debate about the immigration issue on September 30th and the debate of the Senate of France will be held on October 2nd.
China's A-share shows a "repurchase wave" as several listed companies repurchase companies' stocks with cash.
According to a financial data service provider East Money, as of the 27th, the total amount of the repurchase of A-share listed companies in 2019 has exceeded 100 billion Chinese yuan, far more than the amount in the same period of previous years, hitting a record high for the amount of A-share repurchase capital.
Xu Yang, Chairman of Shanghai Macro Information Consulting Co, said that the overall valuation of the A-share market is relatively low this year. Repurchasing stocks at a relatively low price is conducive to improving the efficiency of capital use of listed companies. It reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage their market value, shows their sufficient cash flow conditions and therefore boosts investors' confidence.
In addition, improving the share repurchase system can also encourage listed companies to actively carry out share repurchases.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Detailed Rules for the Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies issued by the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange provided detailed rules and guides for listed companies to repurchase shares.
According to statistics, listed companies that have implemented share repurchase plans this year are mainly in the infrastructure, the real estate, the information technology and the electronic equipment manufacturing industry.
In addition, regarding the repurchase payment amount, there are six listed companies whose repurchase amount exceeded one billion yuan this year.
Among all of them, Yili was ranked first, with a repurchase amount of more than five billion yuan.
What impact will the repurchase of shares have on the market?
Zhao Xijun, deputy director of the School of Finance of Renmin University of China said in an interview with the China News Service that the repurchase shows that the listed company has strong economic power and good financial status so that it has the ability to maintain the stability of the stock price and give investors confidence. It also shows that listed companies and their shareholders are being responsible for the companies, the market and the investors.
The former is based on the company's good operating performance, while the latter requires listed companies and their controlling shareholders to have a higher quality.
For the capital market, this is the core basic element.
The repurchase of stocks by listed companies is beneficial to boost investors' confidence and support the stock price.
It is estimated by East Money that based on the estimated number of stocks being purchased set by the A-share listed companies since the beginning of this year and the average transaction price of the stocks repurchased, the incremental capital brought by the stock repurchase to the A-share market this year is expected to exceed 150 billion yuan.
Tianjin Tianhou Temple, a major historic and cultural site under state protection, just completed the restoration of a large piece of mural, Sketches of Mazu, who is also known as Mother Ancestor or Empress of Heaven in China, on September 26th. The restoration took almost two months and the mural will be reopened to visitors during China's National Day holiday.
The Sketches of Mazu is a series of mural telling the story of Mazu.
With the authorization from the government, the mural was painted by Cai Changkui, former curator of the Museum of Folk Customs of Tianjin(the Tianhou Temple) from 1991 to 1994.
The mural was painted on the north and south palace wall of the Tianhou Temple's main hall. It is 32 meters long and 2.6 meters high and is divided into two parts. It uses 358 characters to tell about Mazu's life with more than 30 stories, including how she was born, how she saved people on the sea and how she ascended to heaven and became an immortal.
Cai Changkui introduced that summers in Tianjin have been wet while winters have been dry in recent years. This led to cracks in the mural. 60 percent of the mural area was covered by cracks.
In order to protect and save the mural telling stories of Mazu, Ancient Cultural Street Committee of Nankai District, Tianjin, and the Tianhou Temple carried out the restoration work of the main hall of the Tianhou Temple and the mural inside of it.
The restoration work was led by Cai Changkui, together with four traditional Chinese painters.
The principle was to restore the mural to its original state instead of turning it into a new. Additionally, experts adjusted some of the contents and improved the imperfect parts of the mural.
During the restoration, we also had some innovation and attempts in the color, materials and painting techniques.
The original feature, style and spirit were still kept after the restoration.
The Tianhou Temple was built in 1326. Its original name was Tianfei Temple or Niangniang Temple. It has been through many times of restoration and is now the oldest groups of buildings in the urban area of Tianjin and one of the oldest Mazu Temples in China.
Opening ceremony of Beijing Daxing International Airport held on September 25th
The new aviation hub of Beijing Daxing International Airport is shaped like a phoenix spreading its wings and is honored the top of the "seven wonders in the new world".
Currently, Beijing Capital International Airport is overstressed with more than 100 million passengers handled in 2018. It has become the second airport handling more than 100 million passengers annually right after Atlanta International Airport in the United States.
Beijing Daxing International Airport, whose international code will be PKX, is designed to handle 45 million passengers by 2020 and 72 million passengers by 2025. International airlines will account for 20 percent by 2020 and grow to 30 percent by 2025.
As a new gate of the country, how cool the new airport is?
Located at the junction of Beijing’s Daxing district and Langfang in neighboring Hebei Province, Beijing Daxing International Airport, 46 kilometers from the Tiananmen Square, is the world’s largest aviation terminal housed in a single building.
The area of its steel-framed roof structure is about 180 thousand square meters, or 25 standard football fields, which is the largest in the world.
The new airport is the first terminal in the world that adopted a two-story design for departures, with floor one to four for international arrival, domestic arrival, domestic departure and international departure respectively.
There are two bridges connecting the airport and the expressway outside the terminal and leading to floor three and floor four respectively. The upper one is for international departure, while both of them can lead to domestic departure.
The first flight taking off from Beijing Daxing International Airport marks the beginning of Beijing entering the time of having "double airports".
The new airport is designed to be an international air travel hub, the new source of power for China's development and the hub of communication in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region supporting the construction of China's Xiong'an New Area. Up to now, 66 airlines have applied to operate at the airport and have been given formal approval. Among them, 20 are domestic airlines and 46 overseas ones.
This year, it is expected to open 116 airlines including 101 domestic ones and 15 international routes at this airport, covering 112 destinations around the world including 97 domestic ones and 15 international ones.
As Beijing's second international airport, Daxing Airport is expected to work, compete and form a world-class "double hub" pattern with Beijing Capital International Airport appropriately. The new airport will not only share and reduce the traffic load on overstressed Beijing Capital International Airport but also meet the rising demand of the capital and the surrounding areas for air travel. Eventually, their development will effectively improve the competitiveness of China's aviation industry.
sure efficiency and quality, considering the geographical condition, the airspace of the airport and the surrounding areas and the operating environment, Daxing International Airport has four runways leading to four different directions, boasts the world's largest automatic air traffic management system and China's largest terminal control area so as to improve the efficiency as much as possible.
It is the first airport with this scale in China to be equipped with a domestically designed automatic luggage transport system and information management system. The innovative systems will significantly improve luggage processing efficiency.
The first flight taking off from Daxing Airport represents a phoenix spreading its wings and flying.
The new airport boasts more than 40 international and domestic firsts. Over 98 percent of the airport's components were locally sourced. With all of these, it will, directly and indirectly, impact industries in the surrounding areas and inject a new spark of life into Beijing's economic development.

Boxiang Wang， The former clerk for the Shouguang County Party Committee in Shandong — — Make the county strong and help people become rich with an innocent heart like a child - Xinhua Net
Boxiang Wang, born in Shouguang of Shandong on February 1943, began to work in 1967 and had served as clerk for the township party committee, clerk for the county party committee, and mayor.
In 1986, Boxiang Wang was appointed as the clerk for the Shouguang County Party Committee in Shandong. At that time, Shouguang was a poor county in Weifang.
During the five years of his position in Shouguang, Boxiang Wang cared about civilians and concentrated on three things: First, boosting the industrialization of vegetables; Second, developing the salt marsh at the north of Shouguang; Third, building the foundation for the development of industry. These helped Shouguang civilians become richer and more confident.
Shouguang farmers had the tradition of vegetable cultivation but also the lesson from it.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers had a good harvest but could not sell the vegetables, letting the vegetables rot in the earth.
Based on the investigations, Boxiang Wang found that the circulation is the key to sell the vegetables.
Shouguang was the first to build the wholesale market for vegetables, serving as the prelude to the development of market economics.
Party members and cadres took the lead, and the county would bear all the losses if they made a mess.
In 1989, 17 party members including Leyi Wang in Sanyuanzhu Village set up 17 vegetable greenhouses that are warm in Winter with the support of Boxiang Wang. At that year, this village had 17 “double households with an annual income of ten thousand yuan".
Then the county established the promotion group. Under the mobilization of Boxiang Wang, Leyi Wang made a tour guide around every village and town and managed to popularize 5000 vegetable greenhouses in the first year. Then the vegetable greenhouses were popularized to the whole county and even the whole country so quickly like the fire on the prairie.
For thousands of years, there have been only 1.6 million acres of salt marsh and shallow beach at the north of Shouguang.
The local civilians had led a very tough life.
The south of Shouguang has the vegetable greenhouses, what about the north of Shouguang?
Boxiang Wang organized tens of thousands of people to camp on the salt marsh and work for nearly 50 days.
Boxiang Wang and the leaders in the county lived at the construction sites and worked with rural laborers. They ate in the wind and slept in the dew, winning the admiration of civilians……During that period, the north of Shouguang developed 150 thousand acres of shrimp pond, 200 thousand acres of salt pan, and 600 thousand acres of cotton field. The economic potential of the salt marsh was fully developed.
In July 1986, Boxiang Wang first attended the industry conference in Weifang as the clerk for the County Party Committee.
During the conference, a form that compared the economic performances across twelve cities and counties in Weifang was issued, and the total production value of industry in Shouguang seemed good, ranking as number four.
However, if the crude salt did not count, Shouguang only had the pure industry production of 119 million Yuan, ranking as the last third one.
Boxiang Wang led more than 70 people to other provinces to exchange experience.
Within one year after coming back, the county invested 150 million Yuan for 77 projects.
After that, they sent groups of people to Shenzhen, Dongguan, Shanghai and other places every year to learn experience.
Shouguang did not have enough enterprises, let alone the entrepreneurs.
Boxiang Wang made a decision on the meeting with special sessions: conducting the public selection for factory directors and managers in the whole county, 40 competent and enterprising people would be selected to work at the front line of industry.
Shouguang was selected into the list of top hundred provinces across the country in 1991, when Boxiang Wang was appointed to as the vice mayor of Wefang.
What he has accomplished are more than 200 thousand vegetable greenhouses, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt pans, shrimp pond, 4854 enterprises, more than 100 thousand “households with an annual income of ten thousand yuan”, and the respected leaders. Until today, the civilians in Shouguang still cordially call him “our Boxiang clerk”.
Yi Wang, the State Councilor and Foreign Minister, presided at the Foreign Minister’s Meeting involving China and African Member Countries of the Security Council at the UN headquarters in New York on September 26 local time.
The Foreign Ministers of current African Member Countries of the Security Council including Tano from Côte d’Ivoire, Oyono from Equatorial Guinea, Pandor from South Africa, and the Foreign Ministers of candidate Member Countries including Carla from Niger and Jehinavi from Tunisia, attended the meeting.
Yi Wang proposed four suggestions to strengthen the cooperation between China and Africa at the Security Council.
First, unity is strength.
The biggest challenge of the current international situation is unilateralism, directly causing the basic norms of international relations to be challenged, impacting on the role of the UN, and damaging the interests of a wide range of developing countries as well as middle and small countries, including African nations.
China and Africa need to go hand in hand and side by side. Unity is strength.
At the Security Council, if the three countries in Africa speak with one voice, their impact will go beyond 3 votes to the whole African continent.
If China stands with Africa, it means more than 4 votes. Instead it will encourage other countries to follow up, affecting and shaping the agenda of the Security Council.
Since 2018, China and the African Members of the Security Council have established a “3+1” coordination mechanism which should be fully used.
Second, troubleshooting is based on negotiation.
China keeps proposing to resolve the front-burner issues through politics. Africa has the good tradition of negotiation and the experience of successful mediation by African regions and organizations of the subzones.
The root cause of most complicated problems on the Security Council’s agenda, especially the hot spot in Africa, is the colonialism. Some other causes are directly associated with external factors.
We should make a good use of the Chapter Six in the UN Chapter, giving full play to the role of the UN in mediation and conciliation.
Third, realizing self-improvement through autonomy.
The nations and people in Africa best understand the problems of Africa. Africa has the ability and intelligence to solve its own problems.
When dealing with the front-burner issues in Africa, the Security Council should give ear to Africa’s will with respect, play a part in organizing regions and subregions, and encourage and support the endogenous solution proposed by Africa.
China is willing to strengthen the coordination with Africa, firmly boosting Africa’s capacity building of peaceful independent actions.
Fourth, resolving the essential problems based on development.
China and a wide range of nations in Africa are developing countries. We should persist in putting the development of economics and society in the first place, mutually supporting our own choices of development path.
China is willing to integrate the co-construction of the Belt and Road into the Africa Union’s 2063 Agenda, the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the development strategies across the countries in Africa, helping African countries improve their development abilities and erase the root cause of their conflicts.
We should jointly promote the UN to invest in the development of Africa.
Given the outbreak of Ebola epidemic in Democratic Republic of the Congo again, China has given and will continue to give the full support, trying their best to provide assistance of manpower, goods and materials. China is also willing to coordinate actions with African countries and to mobilize the UN and the World Health Organization to reinforce their assistance, giving full play to the role of Democratic Republic of the Congo in stabilizing the United Nations Mission in Sudan.
Doctors work in relays to save baby's life.
Thrilling!
A 32-week pregnant mother gave birth to her second baby prematurely in the front passenger seat of her husband's car on the way to the hospital.
Fortunately, gynecologists and neonatologists saved the baby's life by handling the situation in time and working in relays.
Coincidently, on the 19th, 20th and 21st, Hubei Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital has received three premature babies who were all born on the way to the hospital. Besides the baby born in his father's car, the other two were born in the ambulance and were both 29-week premature babies.
Ms Cheng is a mother of two babies. At 7 am on September 19th, she began to feel pain in her abdomen. With the experience of giving birth to her first premature baby, she packed items for labour and was ready to go to the hospital after a shower.
After half-past nine, Ms Cheng packed everything she needed and asked her husband to drive from Xu Dong's to the hospital.
However, just a few minutes after departure, the baby could not wait to get out from his mommy's womb and was born in the front passenger seat of his daddy's car.
Ms Cheng and the baby finally arrived at the building of Hunan Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital 20 minutes later.
The security notified the obstetrics department immediately after seeing the flustered couple and their little baby. Associate Senior Doctor Zhang Huan and other three doctors as well as a midwife Liu Yanyan took bags just yet and rushed downstairs.
"The mother was half lying on the passenger seat at that time. She was sitting on her amniotic fluid and blood. A baby boy was by her side with the umbilical cord uncut."
Zhang Huan was told that it was a 32-week premature baby. The parents did not have time to have him covered. The baby turned pale because of the cold weather in the morning of fall. He was not crying and felt weak all over.
Liu Yanyan hurried to deal with the baby's umbilical cord. Zhang Huan got into the car from the driver's side and opened the bag to cover the baby with a towel and cloth and cleaned his respiratory tract (as the picture shows). The baby was then sent to the obstetrics department on the 12th floor.
Neonatologists rushed to the Nurse Station to rescue the baby after hearing the news.
The baby's face turned purple because of suffocation and a lack of oxygen. Doctors, therefore, intubated the baby immediately. His heartbeat gradually returned and face became rosy after about a minute. The resuscitation was successful.
The 32-week premature baby was put on a respirator after being hospitalized. It was taken away on the second day when the baby's breath became steady after the resuscitation.
After a week of treatment, the baby is now having a stable pathological sign with a smooth breath. He has been fed with a small amount of milk recently.
It was a coincidence that on the 19th, 20th and 21st, the obstetrics department and neonatology department of the hospital has received three premature babies who were born on the way in three days. The other two were born in the ambulance and were both 29-week premature babies. They are all under treatment now.
Head of the obstetrics department of the Provincial Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital Sun Guoqiang said that in recent years, the hospital has received several babies born in subways and cars. It can pose a threat to the life of both mothers and babies if they are not taken good care of.
Sun wants to call people's attention that pregnant mothers should go to a hospital immediately if the pain in the abdomen, water breaking or bleeding happens.
A pregnant woman should try to lie on her back if she is about to give birth at home or on the way. A blanket can be put under the body to protect the baby's head from hitting on the floor. The baby should be kept warmth immediately after birth and should be sent to the nearest hospital as soon as possible.

Earn three points by one free throw?
On the 27th of Beijing time, NBA G League announced an experimental rule change. Under the new rule, one free throw worth one, two or three points will be awarded in the event of any foul that would typically result in one, two or three free throws being shot under standard NBA rules.
Among all NBA stars, Shaquille O'Neal has a relatively low free throw percentage.
According to the new rule, if it is an and-one situation, that one free throw counts as one point, same as always. If players are fouled shooting a two-point shot, the free throw counts as two points. If they are fouled shooting a three-pointer, it counts as three points.
The new rule will not apply during the final two minutes of the fourth quarter or the entirety of any overtime period.
The new rule is only being experimented in the NBA G League in the new season. However, fans are caring more about its impacts on players if the rule is implemented at the NBA level.
Currently, many people believe that this new rule will be beneficial to James Harden but may cause LeBron James some trouble since he is not very good at free throws.
Wuhan offers up to 20 million Yuan in subsidies to promote intelligent technology reconstruction of its industrial enterprises
Wuhan has accelerated its industrial reconstruction since the beginning of this year, and it offers subsidies of up to 20 million Yuan to encourage enterprises to adopt intelligent technology, the reporter has learned on the 27th from the city's series of themed press conferences "A Tribute to New China, Greetings to Military World Games" held by the Information Office of Wuhan Municipal Government.

By offering free consultation and diagnosis services, as well as proposing solutions for the industrial enterprises above the designated size, the plan aims to further facilitate enterprises' technical renovations.
According to the plan, Wuhan will publicly select a group of professional consulting agencies every year, and they will investigate the intelligent technology reconstruction needs of all the industrial enterprises above the designated size in the city by setting up columns, sending out questionnaires, visiting and collecting information, etc..
Up to now, requests from more than 800 industrial enterprises above the designated scale, nearly one-third across the city, have been collected.
Five municipal consulting platforms have organized teams to start serving the enterprises in batches and carry out "one-on-one" on-site evaluation and plan discussion.
Zhang Hong noted that there are 373 intelligent renovation projects currently being implemented in the city and the investment is expected to reach 29.76 billion Yuan. A number of industry leading smart workshops and smart factories have started constructions one after another, such as the first 5G smart production line in central China from Hong in Communications, a country's leading mobile phone smart production line from Motorola, a digital, unmanned transformer factory from Wuhan Siemens, the country's first satellite mass production line from China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, a world's leading smart production line of new veterinary drugs from Hue Shang Biology, IOT smart production line from EU Smart Home, etc..
In addition, Wuhan will also enhance its fiscal and financial support for intelligent renovation projects.
That includes, an industrial enterprise undergoing intelligent technology reconstruction will be given a subsidy which equals to 8% of its completed investment (including the investment on equipments and hardwares, as well as on research and development) with a cap of 20 million Yuan.
At the same time, the government will also work together with Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Business Bank Wuhan Branch and other financial institutions to provide personalized financial services specifically for the intelligent technology reconstruction of industrial enterprises in order to reduce their financing pressure.
After Justin Trudeau's public persona has collapsed, is he able to still win the re-election
It was Trudeau who dug himself into a big hole, and got quite a cropper this time.
In the past few days many old photos in which the current Prime Minister Trudeau was dressed up as a black man have been exposed by the Canadian media one after another.
It was seen as a blatant act of racial discrimination which immediately had stirred up a shockwave of uproar in Canada.
After it happened, Trudeau has apologized to the public over and over again.
However, Canadian citizens are less than impressed.
Trudeau is doing nothing more than lifting a rock only to drop it on his own feet.
As the political commentator Larry Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the "anti-blackface movement" in the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have launched a high-profile campaign by accusing the opposition or the dissenters on their own side of "a breach of honor and integrity" and repeatedly spreading the line that "whoever makes such mistakes should be kicked out immediately."
In short, Trudeau had dug himself into a big hole and got quite a cropper this time.
As the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, the handsome young Trudeau had triggered off a whirlwind as a "political icon" in his early days of debut.
Once a "novice politician", he took over as the leader of the Federal Liberals and won a surprisingly excellent campaign in Canada's Federal legislative election in 2015. The Liberals secured more that half the seats in the House of Commons and obtained the invaluable power to form a cabinet on its own.
At that time, Trudeau had come up with many mind-blowing political programs and visions, such as "ethnic and gender equality", "ecological-environmental protection" and "economic revitalization," stressing the elimination of corruption and "malpractices" and so on.
However, five years since he came into office, what he did is half-assed in almost all the above fields, "a bit of anticlimax with a fine start but a poor end."
Taking the issue of "ethnic and gender equality" and putting the "blackface" incident aside, he has only "paid lip service" on a series of aboriginal issues, making the aboriginal groups and chiefs move their protesting tents to the gate of Capitol Hill on the 150th anniversary of Canada's founding.
In fighting against corruption, Trudeau had been involved in an uproar regarding the "Lavalin affair" at the turn of this year.
It was revealed that he had put pressure on the authorities and officials responsible for the investigation of irregularity and jobbery of "Lavalin," a construction engineering company from his hometown, by asking the latter "not to be too hard on it."
What's more, after it had blown up into an uproar, Trudeau instead vented his anger on the official disclosing the fraud case. It was the aforementioned Jody Wilson-Raybould, then the Attorney General of Canada, who took the lead to disclose the case and handled directly.
Although the case itself remains suspect, it was hard to get himself out of suspicions.
As many observers have pointed out, largely due to his negligence of "digging himself into holes," Trudeau's pubic persona collapsed five years after he came into power and "the biggest hole" is believed to cover nothing more than the three sides including "his half-assed leadership with a fine start but a poor end," "shooting himself in the foot," and "the sharp contrast between indulging himself and disciplining the others."
Since 2015, supporters for Trudeau have slid all the way from more than 60 percent to more than 30 percent, while his opponents soared from less than 30 percent to more than 60 percent, according to the most authoritative Angus Reid poll data in Canada.
Although other opposition parties and their leaders have shown poor performances as well, quite a portion of voters who would still vote for the Federal Liberals nowadays think incredulously about the persona of the Prime Minister and leader of the ruling party.
As a new term of federal legislative election in Canada is about to start on October 21, will Trudeau be able to replay the drama of a big win five years ago?
The answer may be one word: difficult.
It will bring far-reaching and positive impacts on many levels, whether on business competitions and consumer experiences, or on the regional integration of aviation as well as the integrated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei.
Beijing Daxing International Airport had officially opened on Sept 25th.
The Beijing News reporter has learned from the Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform that Beijing Capital Airport has already been in an overloaded operation, and the opening of Daxing International Airport will improve the service capacity of capital aviation.
Following Shanghai, Beijing has become the second player in China to run two airports in the same city. Similar to the business roles of Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport mainly serving domestic flights and Pudong Airport focusing on international shippings, differentiated services are also introduced in the operation of Bejing Capital Airport and Daxing Airport, which will provide more specialized services in niche markets covering both domestic and international aviation business in the future.
The opening of Daxing Airport, from the perspective of business development, will be in favor of the Capital Airport.
The passenger throughput of Capital Airport has exceeded 100 million in the year of 2018, ranking first in China. However, in contrast with the rapidly growing business demand, there is still a larger gap in its total shipping capacity, especially in the needs for international airlines.
In order to better meet the needs of domestic and overseas passengers, including for sightseeing, business trips and so on, and fit in with Beijing's developing momentum of being increasingly open and compatible with international practices, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub to carry an annual throughput of 100 million passengers and 4 million tons of total cargo in the future.
Therefore, there is no overlapping as to the business roles of two airports which are respectively targeted at different customer segments with enough market potentialities.
Economically speaking, the opening of Daxing International Airport will definitely trigger a win-win effect by relieving the pressure on Beijing's air transport, accelerating the growth rate of passenger and cargo throughput and boosting the incremental growth of Beijing airline service with the dual-core operation.
For the customers, they don't have to rely on the Capital Airport to travel anymore since the opening of Daxing International Airport, which can help reduce a series of problems resulting from the heavy concentration of flight routes such as a longer period of flight support and maintenance, the slowdown of boarding speed, the indirect increase of transit time at the airport for both airlines and passengers. Actually, it can also help improve the passengers' traveling experience by reducing the burden on the Capital Airport's service.
According to the media's calculations on the time and expense of getting to Daxing International Airport via different transportation routes, if you leave from the south fifth-ring road and ride directly to Daxing Airport expressway by passing over Beijing-Kaifeng highway, it will take 50 minutes and cost about 40 yuan for a round trip in addition to an expressway toll of 15 yuan. If you choose the rail transportation by taking Daxing Airport subway, its ticket rates are divided into three levels by 10, 25 and 35 yuan, charged according to the distance limits up from 20 to 30 kilometers. Passengers can also take Beijing-Xiong'an Intercity Railway at the Beijing West Railway Station to get over to Daxing Airport station within just 20 minutes.
In general, there are a lot of transportation options for passengers to get to the Daxing Airport with a reasonable range of cost and time.
For its future development: as the transportion hub in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Daxing airport is located a little far away from downtown Beijing. However, its radiations to Hebei and Tianjin are strengthened by facilitating the travels of more of the population and is of great significance to promote the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, passengers from Hebei and Tianjin will be able to enjoy more international airline services provided by Daxing International Airport which can be seen from the transportation plan of Daxing International Airport.
The affiliated transportation facilities of Daxing Airport are perfect. In addition to the new airport subway line from downtown Beijing to Daxing Airport, there are several expressways connecting the airport with the neighboring area.
In the same way passengers from Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other cities in Guangdong can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport via the Guangzhou-Foshan, Guangzhou-Shenzhen expressway, residents in Langfang and Xiong'an New Area around Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport by enjoying a convenient and efficient air service.
As we can see, the opening of Daxing International Airport does not only mean an increase of runways and planes, but also will have a far-reaching and positive impact, whether on business competition and consumer experience, or the regional integration of aviation and the integrated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. It is not only connected with the long-term development of Beijing air industry to provide a diversified choice of traveling for the general residents in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and promoting Beijing air industry to further improve its service quality, but also will be more favorable for promoting the integrated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and stimulating the economic development in the surrounding area of the airport.
As to the opening of Daxing Airport, it is necessary for us to not only care about the economical interests individually but also to think big and drive the overall growth of the whole region.

2019 Forum Socio-Economic Situation of Vietnam Held in Thua Thien-Hue
According to Nguyen Duc Kien, vice chairman of the National Assembly (NA)’s Economics Committee, Vietnam’s socio-economic situation maintains its growth and has shown positive signs.
The forum discussed major social-economic issues of Vietnam in the first few months of 2019, as well as measures for Vietnam’s socio-economic development at the end of 2019 and in 2020.
Participants discussed four main topics, including Vietnam’s economic development in 2019 and impacts of free trade agreements, major issues of Vietnam’s economy in 2019, major socio-cultural issues of Vietnam in 2019, and projections and ideas for Vietnam’s socio-economic development in 2020.
Participants believed that, in the first few months of 2019, the global economy witnessed a sluggish growth. We are facing more risks and challenges.
Trade friction between large economies has caused negative impacts on global trade and investment.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), despite the uncertainty seen in the global economy with 70% of the economies having economic slowdown, Vietnam made significant achievements in economic development as the macroeconomy has been stable, inflation is under control and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the first half of 2019 grew by 2.64% in average, the lowest over the past three years.
The first six months of 2019 witnessed a Gross Domestic Products (GDP) growth by 6.76%, lower than the same period last year which was 7.05%, but much higher than it was in the same period in 2011 to 2017.
When predicting the economic growth in 2019 to 2020, Dang Duc Anh, deputy director of National Socio-Economic Prediction Centre of Vietnam, said that the Vietnamese economy has developed fast in 2019 despite the fact that there has been economic turbulence around the world.
It is estimated that by 2020, the Vietnamese macroeconomy will remain steady. The implementation of free trade agreements will promote trade development. The economic structure will be further improved, so will the business environment. There will be a reduction in export from Vietnam due to global trade friction.
As a result, it is necessary to improve the monitoring and warning mechanism so that remedies for the reduction in export can be taken and opportunities to explore new export market can be found, thus bringing convenience to the export of commodities such as agricultural and aquatic products.
In the meanwhile, inflation should be kept at a reasonable level so to promote the development of supporting industries, high tech agriculture，organic and ecological agriculture, etc..
Liu Zhijie, director of the Siem Reap consulate office of the Chinese embassy in Cambodia, held a reception party in Siem Reap on the 26th to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Liu Zhijie said that China had been playing an active role in international affairs in the past 70 years since its founding and had made major contributions to global peace and development by committing to global economic governance and common development with unique solutions of Chinese wisdom, which had brought real benefits to Cambodia's economic development as well as to the well-being of its people.
Liu Zhijie commented that as the world's second largest economy, China's contribution to the global economic growth has exceeded 30%. Particularly driven by China's Belt and Road initiative, in-depth cooperations are under way between China's local cities and Siem Reap as well as other provinces in the consular district.
He added that this year marks the beginning of the 61-year-long diplomatic ties between China and Cambodia; and between the two countries a brotherly friendship has been forged. Cooperations based on mutual benefits between China and Cambodia will certainly drive the local economic and social development.

Witness China's "rise of cloud" in the past ten years in Yunqi Cloud Town - Xinhua Net
If the local website forum in 2009 is regarded as a start, the Yunqi Apsara Conference 2019 held in Hangzhou from the 25th to the 27th was the 10th anniversary of the holding of the conference.
From knowing little about the concept and feeling like "head in the clouds" to the practice of "going up to the cloud" by developing big data and cloud computing, China has witnessed how they became the core technology in supporting China's economic growth, social management and public services.
In the photovoltaic cell workshop of CHINT Group in Haining, China's eastern Zhejiang province, many quality inspectors had new "colleagues" equipped with Alibaba Cloud artificial intelligence by their sides.
It works 24 hours a day, with the recognition speed of more than twice that of a man and the accuracy of quality inspection of more than 95%.
According to the head of the company, the new "quality inspector" equipped with a camera has learnt more than 40,000 flawed samples. With its cloud computing ability, it can quickly convert an infrared image into the binary language and divide the flawed battery cell from the others.
This company is just an example in today's manufacturing transformation supported by cloud computing.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the Guide on Promoting the Using of Cloud Computing in Enterprises (2018-2020), saying that by 2020, enterprises' awareness and enthusiasm for using cloud should be significantly increased, so do the proportion of cloud adoption and depth of application.
Founder of Alibaba Cloud Wang Jian said that today, data-centered cloud computing has built a bridge and opened the way for a digital economy with data as a key element.
Moreover, in the past ten years, the scale of China's cloud computing industry has continued to expand.
According to the White Paper on Cloud Computing Development (2019) released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) in July this year, China's overall cloud computing market size reached 96.28 billion Chinese yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2 percent year-on-year.
On top of becoming a key technology to supporting industrial transformation and the development of the digital economy, the invisible "cloud" has also changed urban management and social life imperceptibly.
At this year's Yunqi Apsara Conference, the City Brain, which has shown up in the past three years' conferences, still attracted a lot of attention.
Alibaba Cloud introduced that at present, the City Brain has shifted from a traffic management tool to the center of a city's management. Related cooperation and application have been expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception and artificial intelligence algorithms, the City Brain uses its powerful computing ability to enable new service functions of city management, such as "parking before paying", "real-time monitoring of the number of people seeing a doctor" and "designing of a tourist route".
In terms of government services, cloud computing has brought convenience to both the provider and the receiver of the government services by using "one cloud" to handle "one thing" and promote "offices in phones" and "services in phones" in coordination.
At present, Zhejiang has built a public data platform across the province by applying cloud computing to handling government affairs.
As of September 11, the platform has covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province and collected 19.08 billion pieces of data in 3,066 categories.
Averagely, government departments in Zhejiang province transferred and shared data for 12 million times per month. Every time the data is transferred on the ‘cloud’, it can help the people do less work.
Stay away from plastic tea bags!
The Central News Agency reported that a recent study in Canada found that a plastic tea bag might release billions, or even ten billions of plastic particles, which are significantly more than the estimated amount of microplastics consumed by a person in an entire year. However, as of now, there is no evidence suggesting the ingestion of microplastics can pose a risk to human beings.
According to the report, researchers from McGill University in Canada have found that a plastic tea bag steeped in a cup of almost boiling water (95 Celsius degrees) can release around 11.6 billion micro plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoscale particles into the cup.
This is significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastics consumed by a person in an entire year.
According to research published earlier in 2019, a person eats at least 50,000 micro plastic particles and breathes in the same quantity.
In this study, published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, researchers are reported to have tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags from shops and cafés in Montreal, which were cut open, washed, and then steeped into near-boiling water for five minutes before being analyzed by electron microscopes and spectroscopy.
According to this study, they have found that a single tea bag can release 11.6 billion micro plastic particles, which is "several orders of magnitude higher than the plastic loads previously reported in other foods."
The report says, although most tea bags are made from natural fibers, many tea bag brands that use natural fibers still use plastic to seal the bags.
Some brands have moved away from paper tea bags toward plastic tea bags, and it was these plastic bags that the researchers examined.
Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic, which are defined by researchers as ranging from 100 nm to 5 mm in size and mostly created by the disintegration of plastic litter.
Researchers have found traces of microplastics in the air, soil, rivers, and the deepest oceanic trenches around the world, as well as in tap and bottled water, seafood, and beer.
Researchers found microplastics in human stool samples for the first time in October 2018.
In order to test the potential toxicity of the microplastics released from the tea bags, this Canadian research team exposed water fleas to the contaminated water and found that the particles had behavioral effects on the fleas and caused developmental malformations.
There is no evidence so far that the ingestion of microplastics poses a risk to humans, according the World Health Organization (WHO).
However, WHO pointed out that more research was needed to fully understand how plastic spreads into the environment and what effects it has on human bodies.
Researchers speculated that the reason of the high number of microplastics released by the tea bags was that the plastic packaging had been in contact with boiling water. Even "food-grade" plastics may degrade or leach toxic substances when heated above 40 degrees.
Guterres indicated that the climate emergency poses the biggest threat to the survival of small island countries.
A natural disaster would jeopardize a generation’s development achievements in those countries.
The disaster situation in Barbuda, Dominica and Bahamas where have suffered from the hurricane attack since this year explains this viewpoint.
About a quarter of people in the small island developing countries live at an altitude of 5 meters or lower.
The removal might exert a strong influence on their society and lifestyle, and even cause the problems of sovereignty and national identity.
On the Climate Action Summit this Monday, small island countries made joint efforts to realize the 100％ renewable energy with carbon neutrality by 2030 whereby they would lead the world to step towards the correct direction again.
Guterres said: “the climate crisis is heaping up the new injustice on the previous injustice”.
Although small island countries made the least contribution to treating the global warming, they paid the highest price.
Due to their middle-income status, many of these countries are still trapped in the deterioration of disaster and debt, as well as the circle of unsustainability.
The world must take actions. It is time to make important decisions and invest heavily in small island developing countries.
A political declaration was passed on today’s high-level meeting, appealing for help to manage the disaster risk in small island developing countries and investing in the infrastructure with climate adaptability and the method for the transformation towards renewable energy; It urges the international organizations to help small island developing countries, especially the middle-income countries in heavy debt, obtain the funding.
The small island developing countries are at the forefront to conserve the lifeblood of the earth — — the ocean.
The updated special report, issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week, demonstrated that the ocean has suffered from the severe consequences of the continuous climate crisis.
By mid-century, the extreme rise in sea-level that used to occur once a century, might occur in many regions every year.
This report warns that some island countries will probably become uninhabitable if they do not invest in the adaptability.
The pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused a great loss.
In the past 150 years, the world had lost half of the live coral. In the past 40 years, the plastic pollution had witnessed a tenfold increase.
The demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is causing the depletion of resources, including the fisheries that maintain many island communities.
The small island countries are also facing the high cost of transportation, energy and infrastructure.
They rely heavily on some external markets, making them vulnerable to the price fluctuation.
Some countries are also attempting to cope with the safety hazard caused by the illegal trade in human beings, weapons and drugs.
Guterres said: “By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, this problem can be solved anywhere”.
The efforts that small island developing countries made to realize the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provide the world with the tools, lessons and instances that can be used for reference.
He stressed that the small island developing countries are the special case of sustainable development.
They need the long-term attention and investment from the whole international society.
The Ministry of Finance of India stated that the financial system has sufficient liquidity.
Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated on the 26th that the current financial system has sufficient liquidity. Driven by consumer demand during holidays, India's economic growth is expected to recover in the second half of this fiscal year.
Sitharaman's statement was made after meeting with representatives from institutions such as Indian private banks, non-bank financial institutions and housing banks.
Sitharaman did not specify where the statement was aimed at.
Before this, some Indian and overseas media attributed India's constant economic slowdown to the tension in liquidity in non-bank financial institutions.
By taking car sales as an example, Sitharaman denied that the tension in liquidity was the main reason for the decline in sales.
She also pointed out that the decline in car sales was mainly caused by cyclical factors.
Driven by the consumption in holidays, India's economic growth may recover in the second half of this fiscal year, according to Sitharaman.
India's annual shopping season is from September to the end of the year.
It is predicted that shopping and consumption will significantly promote India's economic growth.
The Provincial Department of Education of Jiangxi recently issued a notice prohibiting all primary and secondary schools in the province from violating the regulations against extra classes during the National Day holiday. Inspectors will conduct public and private investigations randomly.
In their "Notice on the prohibition of violating the regulations against extra classes during the National Day holiday," the Provincial Department of Education of Jiangxi stressed that primary and secondary schools should also carefully observe the following points: No collective extra classes or new lessons; no subject training, specialized tutorials, Olympic competition tutorials, non-academic tutorials, or progressive training; no campus or school buildings should be rent to any training institutions.
Meanwhile, primary and secondary school teachers are strictly prohibited from organizing or recommending any extra training, or encouraging students to attend such training on- or off-campus. They are also strictly prohibited from working for training institutions outside the school or extra classes organized by other teachers, parents, or parents’ committees, and from recommending students or providing information for such institutions or individuals.
The notice states that if any primary and secondary schools have extra classes, once the case is confirmed, a significant deduction will be applied to the local administrative department of education in the county-level governmental assessment of high-quality development of education in that year. Teachers who take part in extra classes will be subject to serious penalty in compliance with the regulations of teaching ethics.
Support the hog production to ensure the market supply
Sui Zhongcheng requires to implement various measures from 6 aspects.
The video conference promoting the hog production throughout the province to ensure market supply has been held today. It serves to remobilize and redeploy the implementations of the policies and measures of the central and provincial committees and governments to support the hog production so as to guarantee its market supply.
Sui Zhongshi requires that all measures for hog production be implemented from 6 aspects.
It stresses on the implementation of the mayor responsibility system of the “food basket”. The clearly specified provincial-wide slaughter task of 45 million pigs of this year has been assigned to cities and prefectures. The task is included in the mayor responsibility system assessment.
It stresses on the implementation of various policies and measures, paying special attention to effectively solve the “last step” problem of the implementation.
It stresses on the sow production through the earnest implementation of the subsidy policy for capable sow breeding, the encouragement of the expansion of the scale in sow breeding businesses, and the pre-planned selection of outstanding sows from the group of commodity pigs.
It stresses on the implementation of the investment attraction and regards bringing in domestically well-known and large-scale breeding enterprises that have not entered into our province as the top priority of the investment attraction.
It stresses on the implementation of the market circulation system by expediting the facility construction for the cold chain logistic of hogs, comprehensively promoting the changes from “allocating hogs” to “allocating pork”.
It stresses on the modern epidemic prevention system. All localities should be equipped with grassroots epidemic prevention and quarantine personnel, the number of which should be suitable for the breeding scale and work tasks, so as to build the first line of defense for epidemic prevention and control.
Sui Zhongcheng requires to fully guarantee the supply in the meat market, ensuring that there is no large-scale shortage and supply cuts, as well as ensuring a stable supply of pork on market during major holidays.
The conference also deploys on the prevention and control of the swine fever epidemic, the ban and withdraw of fishing within important waters in the Yangtze River basin of the province and the late rice acquisition across the province.
Talking about attachment to the motherland and the national spirit: Representatives from Shanghai’s time-honored brands like White Rabbit Creamy Candy delivered Party lessons for university students
The campus check-in points for "My country and I" became the new obsessions of university students.
In celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, four famous time-honored brands of Shanghai, namely the Shanghai Soap, Shao Wansheng, White Rabbit, Xiandelai, gathered in "Party's art lesson" on the 27th at East China University of Science and Technology. Four representatives from these time-honored brands, with an average history of over 90 years, talked about their attachment to their motherland and national spirit for over 200 young students.
The on-site display of products from the time-honored brands.
The passionate talk amazed the students, who were surprised that a display of products from these time-honored brands had been carefully set up outside the classroom. Also, the campus check-in points for "My country and I" became the new obsessions of university students.
White Rabbit lip balm, White Rabbit ice cream... As a time-honored brand, White Rabbit Creamy Candy in recent years has been seeking transformations and taking initiatives with insistence on innovation and crossover.
As it happens, this brand, founded in 1959, came to celebrate its 60th birthday this year.
Shao Wansheng also turned its attention to young consumers.
Wang Weijie, secretary of the Party branch and deputy general manager of the Shao Wansheng Food Company, Shanghai, described the scenes in which people "eat abalone in lively spring, pickled fish in blazing summer, drunken shrimps in cool autumn, and drunken crabs in cloudy winter," representing unceasing innovation in food culture.
The company also further explored its brand culture via new flavors, comic package designs, etc. to cater for its transmission among the young consumers.
Representatives from the time-honored brands are telling the stories about their journey of innovation at the "Party's art lesson."
Similarly, Yu Jie, manager of Shanghai Xiandelai Pork Ribs Rice Cake Restaurant Co., Ltd, said, "All innovations are rooted in a solid foundation. Every innovation of time-honored brands is a demonstration of its rich tradition.
Everyone has his or her expectations of a time-honored brand.
We should enter an age that focuses on small yet exquisite products."
As one of the first China Time-honored Brands in this country, Shanghai Xiandelai has quickly adapted to the trends of the market, upgraded their visual identity of the brand, employed professional management team, and thereby achieved a substantial increase in turnover.
"The time-honored brands are not just displayed in traditional channels such as supermarkets. We are actively engaging with new retailers and various events.
All these changes are made to reach one goal: We want the consumers to see our products, hear about them, and eventually buy them,"
said Ouyang Yiling, deputy manager of Shanghai Soap Co., Ltd.
In the future, Shanghai Soap will continue to insist on high-end development that systematically focuses on energy-saving, environment-friendly products that bring great prospects and user satisfaction. It will also insist on the high-tech path of high economic benefits.
Students have learned a lot from the Party's art lesson this time.
I grew up with the time-honored brands, which bring back sweet childhood memories and emotions, "
Song Tianyuan said with sentiments.
The representative from a time-honored brand of Shanghai is talking about their attachment to their motherland and national spirit for over 200 young students.
The student Zhou Yiting said it was the task of those who study design to think and explore how to present brand culture so that the good-quality traditional culture can be transmitted to posterity.

Shinzo Abe congratulates China on 70th anniversary of PRC founding and speaks Chinese in the video
On the 26th local time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent a congratulatory video to mark the upcoming 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good evening ladies and gentlemen, I am Shinzo Abe.
I would like to take the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the PRC founding to extend the warm congratulations on behalf of the Japanese government and people.
During the 2019 G20 Osaka Summit held in June, China and Japan worked together to achieve the success of the Summit and passed the G20 Osaka Leaders’ Declaration, showing the strong will of G20 member countries to the world.
Moreover, during the summit and the banquet, we reached an agreement on President Xi Jinping's state visit to Japan in spring next year. We also reached an important consensus on building Sino-Japanese relations that meets the requirements of the new era.
Both China and Japan are sharing a great responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and beyond.
I firmly believe that Japan and China's joint responses to regional and global issues as well as joint contributions to the international community are of great significance for building a new model for the two countries' relations in the future.
In the end, with my best wishes, I hope that Sino-Japan relations will prosper, so will your business.
Over-aged migrant workers at some construction sites are estimated to make up more than half of the total labor force.
Where to find the young workers now?
"There is no other choice but to employ so many old workers at the construction site."
Zou Kui, a contractor who has worked in the construction industry for years, wrote recently on the common scene of over-aged migrant workers (above the retirement age) on construction sites.
In recent times, the college where the writer works started a rainwater and sewage diversion project and therefore many migrant workers came to the campus. If you look out you could find many of over-aged workers inside.
Over-aged migrant workers choose to work outside not because they don't like to stay idle, but because they can't be idlers. With utter helplessness of having to do so, these old people who should not be working are driven to keep working hard, whether to save money to support their own livelihoods and provisions of medical healthcare, or for helping their children.
The final solution to the problem of keeping over-aged migrant workers healthy and out of poverty doesn't come easily as we had thought.
Raising a family, supporting the elderly, educating children, helping children build houses and buy cars, helping children get married and raise grandchildren, when these migrant workers have finished all these life tasks, their moneybags have been emptied, even ending up with debts, and most of them are short of wealth accumulation.
In order not to bring their children more trouble and save more money for their own benefits, many migrant workers insist on "working til they can do nothing".
A new generation of migrant workers, including many post-80s, post-90s and even post-00s, are unwilling to accept work in the secondary or low-end service industry of dirty work and of high labor intensity. This results in the structural shortage of a qualified labor force and brings opportunities for over-aged migrant workers.
Without excellent skills, physical energy and work efficiency, many over-aged workers have to be concentrated in jobs of high work intensity, high risks, low income, and low security.
The more you are able to work, the more you are able to earn. The survival predicaments of over-aged migrant workers (beside the fact that they can't be idlers) cannot be ignored and overlooked.
To solve their problems of getting unpaid wages, improving labor protection, reducing safety risks, increasing work wages, and improving the living conditions for those over-aged migrant workers, regulatory interventions and humane concerns from public administrations are also inseparable in addition to their own self-struggling.
Some scholars have pointed out that over-aged workers are unlikely to rely on farming at home to sustain their retirement life and healthcare; they must support their families through other means.
Their desperation and determination reflected in the fact that over-aged migrant workers have to keep busy will help us better understand their love and pains.
Seeing their backs and hearing their sighs, the administration, market and society have to work favorably and share responsibilities in a joint effort to help those over-aged migrant workers become financially independent after their return to the countryside.
Chemetsov said that Russia would not export this kind of system in the next five years, because “it will be first supplied to domestic army before export”.
This action completely conforms with the international convention.
The major manufacturing countries of weapon and military equipment would always put their own defensive needs in the first place before processing the export orders.
Earlier, the Deputy Commander of the Russian Air and Space Force, General Yuri Grekhov, suggested that the development of this system was about to be completed.
The S-500 system was developed by the Concern of “Adamas-Antai” Aerospace Defense.
This is a new generation of air defense system which employs the principle aimed at destroying the ballistics and aerodynamics.
The main function of S-500 is to intercept the intermediate-range ballistic missiles, and it can intercept the missiles within a range of 3500 kilometers.
Furthermore, according to some data, S-500 can also destroy the hypersonic cruise missiles, airplanes, almost all types of pilotless airplanes, the hypersonic missiles that are more than 5 times faster than the velocity of sound, and even the targets near the space.
This type of weapon can also be integrated into other air defense systems to be an unified network, especially the S-400 system, which is vert important to the national defense.
Sergey Chemetsov expressed his special focus on the S-400.
He said, there is a great demand for this system in the world. However, the Russian armies, including those at the arctic region, also need it.
The S-400 air defense system came into service at the arctic regiment of air defense.
According to the report on September 15, the arctic regiment of air defense in Nova Zembla had finished refitting the S-400 air-defense missile system.
This is not Russia’s militarization at the arctic region.
The Ministry of Defense of Russia claimed that this is entirely part of the interim plan to equip the northern strategic direction with more advanced defensive tools.
According to the information office at the Northern Fleet of Russia: “With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controlled airspace within the arctic region is markedly increased.”
What counts is that this system works very well at the Far North and the arctic region based on the military evaluations.
The officers and soldiers at the regiment of air defense were drilled for the new system, and made preparations for combat duty.
It used to be equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system which is partly reserved now.
When it comes to the air defense system, it must be equipped with weapons that can destroy a variety of aerial targets no matter they are high-speed flights at the high altitude or “the fish that escapes from the net” approaching the protected facilities.
According to the public source information, the S-400 “Triumph” developed by the Concern of “Adamas-Antai” Aerospace Defense is designed to attack the strategic aircrafts and TACAIRs, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other air weapons.
This weapon can attack the targets of aerodynamics within a range of 400 kilometers, and shoot down the ballistic targets flying at the speed of 4.8 kilometers per second within a range of 60 kilometers.
Russia has never concealed the fact that it will improve its deployment of air defense force at the Far North, to ensure the safety of its territorial air space.
Not long ago, the first 12 sets of “Tor- M2DT” system of air-defense missile were delivered to the arctic region of Russia, forming a battalion of air defense to strengthen the air-defense system at the arctic region.
At that time, the Ministry of National Defense of Russia indicated that the “Tor” troops would be extended to be a complete brigade-level organizational system.
Coupled with the S-400 long-range system deployed at Nova Zembla and Kola Peninsula and the “Pantsir-SA” short-range system deployed at the Far North, these cutting-edge air-defense weapons are protecting the polar sky of Russia effectively.
The enemies’ warplanes, helicopters and robombs can hardly break through this defense.
According to the Russian government, flagship stores are going to become platforms for Russian manufactures to showcase their products so as to avoid the complicated and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
As a store operator of Russian products, Epinduo specializes in selling Russian goods within China.
Epinduo has opened online stores on most of the largest trading platforms in China including Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, ShouQ and Wechat, a multifunctional instant messaging software. Besides, the company has its own online platform, Epinduo.com, and its own commodity retail chain stores.
Russian Export Center will join hands with Epinduo to develop store marketing strategies and participation standards, as well as to screen companies with the qualification to list products on the virtual shelves.
It is planned to open and list products from at least 10 Russian manufactures before the end of this year.
According to the information from Russian Export Center, the total monthly visit of China e-commerce platforms reaches up to 1 billion.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been showing a steady growth since 2014, have surpassed 1 billion US dollars in 2018.
At present, the Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores to sell products from New Zealand, Malaysia, and Singapore within the global import strategic framework.
According to Alexei Kozhevnikov, the new store will display products from companies with sales of at least 500 million rubles.
Honestly speaking, I have a higher expectation. 500 million rubles is not worth mentioning compared to the sales amounts they are going to achieve.
We all know that Chinese customers hold very positive attitudes towards Russian products and accept Russian products as high-quality, green and environmentally friendly.
Kozhevnikov expressed that the competition for the strong purchasing power of Chinese consumers is intense and is still intensifying.
“We have an ambitious goal that is to launch 500 companies through this store within 3 years，” he said.
At the same time, the store will list products manufactured by companies from Russian Far East.
According to Professor Vyacheslav Cheglov, from the Department of Basic Trade Policy of Plekhanov University of Economics in Russia, “this is a political project representing the images of both parties because Russian Export Center is an state-owned rather than a private institution.”
“I haven’t seen an abundance of highly competitive Russian products in the market.”
He thinks it is not likely for the project to be actually implemented, but it’s helpful to strengthen the ties between the two countries.
According to RIA Novosti, Andrey Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Center, indicated during the Eastern Economic Forum that the product information of about 170 Russian companies has already been released on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform. Those products can be purchased from both China and any other countries around the world.
Moreover, there is another mode of cooperation with the Alibaba Group, namely, the training project of specialists from Taobao University for Russian companies. The first seminar of this training project has been held in July this year.
The Russian Export Center will also organize Russian companies to participate in the industry exhibition and the commercial projects sections at the 2nd China International Import Expo in November this year.
A large exhibition will be held in a showroom of 1000 square meters. The same place is also become the venue to hold business project activities, agreement signing ceremonies, promotion meetings and talks with representatives of Chinese companies.
So far, the Expo has received about 50 applications from Russian agribusiness.
According to the press office of the Russian Export Center, “besides setting up agricultural booths, we will hold business meetings to provide opportunities for entrepreneurs to establish direct connections.”
“Such is another direction of our efforts. Our goal is to support those companies and to ensure to arrange dozens of special meetings for them.”
Furthermore, master classes, cooking competitions, and celebrity-chef-cooked Russian food tastings as a part of the project of “Exploring Russian Cuisine, Shanghai Station” will be organized during the Expo.

When does the next bus come?
"Internet + Smart Display" will tell you.
Nanjing Smart Traffic, in collaboration with Gaode Map, announced on the 27th that the first batch of the country's "Internet + Smart Display" were officially installed in Nanjing, where 54 digital displays will be turned on at bus stops. This will bring the information services of Nanjing to the next level, and increase the efficiency of public transport services and the happiness of passengers.
The anxiety of waiting used to haunt bus stops almost on a daily basis.
As it is difficult to predict bus schedules, and it is difficult to know road conditions and bus locations, the problems of public transport are in need of solution. In some big cities, commuters have a long way to travel, and the traffic situation at peak times are complex, which often leads to bus delays.
Therefore, Nanjing Smart Traffic and its collaborator Gaode Maps explored the new approach of "Internet + Transport" services and launched a project on intelligent services that installed the country's first batch of "Internet + Smart Display."
It is reported that the first batch of "Internet + Smart Display" launched in Nanjing integrate the big data of Gaode and its ETA algorithm of estimated vehicle travel time. By updating the internet and big data of travel on the digital displays at bus stops, the project offers services including publishing bus routes on the two ends of "Smart displays at bus stops + digital maps" and estimating the arrival time of the next bus.
With "Internet + Smart Display," Nanjing citizens can easily get the estimated arrival time of the next bus, real-time location of the bus, and how many stops it is away from the current stop. They can also quickly view road conditions along the bus route via a display in red, orange, and green, and see all buses that pass the current stop.
Thanks to the new technology of "Internet + Smart Display," Nanjing citizens can now enjoy more convenient and efficient public transport that allows them to check the bus location before leaving and to know when the next bus arrives and when they will arrive at their destinations.
They can choose the most appropriate route based on the real-time traffic information provided by "Internet + Smart Display" and know exactly what to expect, which relieves the anxiety of waiting and brings a more relaxing travel experience.

Xinhua News Commentary: unswervingly take our own path
A white paper titled "China and the World in a new Era" was released on June 27, which explains that the fundamental reason for China's success in development over the past 70 years is that the Chinese people have found the right path of developing socialism with Chinese characteristics under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and will unswervingly continue to follow the path.
It is the choice of history and the choice of the people for China to follow a development path suitable for itself.
In modern times, generations of people with lofty ideals have made endless efforts to save the country and the people in an environment of poverty and weakness, internal strife and foreign invasion.
However, "constitutional monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentary system, multi-party system, presidential system have been considered and tried, all of them ended up with failures".
It was not until the Communist Party of China and the new China came that the Chinese people gradually blazed a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The path China has taken is the path of happiness for the Chinese people and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, as well as the universal harmony of common development between China and other countries in the world.
It is just because China is on the right path that it can run its own affairs well, become the world's second largest economy and the biggest contributor to global growth, continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As the white Paper points out, China's development goes in line with its national conditions and meets the requirements of the times, and will show more and more bright prospects as the time goes by.
Looking back, Chinese people know very well how difficult it is to find the right path. Looking around the world, Chinese people will cherish this right path even more.
Chinese people understand the truth that "orange changes with the environments," they know that what is suitable for others may not fit in with their conditions, only what suits themselves is the best.
It is with such confidence in its path and willpower for its strategy that China has created the miracles which have drawn the attention of the world.
In the twists and turns of human history, "the End of History" had once made a noise in the world.
Today, the success achieved by the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics announces the end of the "End of History," the collapse of the "Collapse of China" and the failure of the "failure of socialism."
The success of China has boosted the confidence of developing countries to become rich and strong, expanded the path for developing countries to achieve modernization, and brought experience and reference for other countries and nationalities that wish to speed up their development and maintain their independence by following a path suitable for their national conditions.
The world is diversified.
China has always respected the rights of all countries to choose a development path suited to their national conditions.
China will not "import" foreign models or "export" the Chinese model. Instead, China will remain committed to its own path, realize its own development, strengthen the exchanges with other countries on the governance and administration of state affairs, and make its due contribution for the joint implementation of good governance and fine administration.
The Fair Work Commission found that a Foodworks supermarket owner dismissed a 66-year-old female worker by text message due to his preference for hiring employees of an Asian background. The owner was strongly denounced as "shameful" for what he did.
Ms. Ayton had served at the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years. The Commission said how the owner Jianbin Wang (Eddie by English name) treated the employee was "extremely unfair" and likely breached anti-discrimination laws.
Ms. Ayton told the Commission that Mr. Wang "has been trying to get rid of me" since his takeover of the store in 2016, because she is not Chinese.
In this case, deputy president of the Commission Peter Sams conducted a search on the web, and located “some job ads posted by Mr. Wang on various Chinese Australian's job forums in the past".
Among the requirements for these jobs, one said "Asian female preferred", while another went as "Asian staff preferred".
In the third, he posted "more prefer oversea people" (sic).
Mr Wang dismissed Ms. Ayton by text message in April this year, and later alleged that it was due to her absences from work and money shortages with amounts missing between $5.10 and $30 in cash registers.
However, Mr. Sams noted that reasons given by Mr Wang for his dismissing Ms. Ayton were rather weak, and there was lack of evidence.
In the past three years, she had only one day of non-attendance, and the "money shortages" were only totaled at a few Australian dollars.
He remarked that the dismissal of Ms. Ayton "actually had nothing to do with her behaviors or performance".
“In my view, supported by the job advertisements posted by Mr. Wang, the respondent’s real motive for dismissing her was Mr. Wang’s preference to hire staff of Asian speaking backgrounds,” he said.
“According to section 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, prima facie, Mr Wang’s conduct constituted a breach of anti-discrimination laws and/or the applicant’s dismissal was for an unlawful reason.”
Mr. Sams pointed out that it was inadequate for Mr. Wang to bring back Ms. Ayton's for the job given how "appalling" he had treated her.
He should instead consider to pay in compensation for Ms. Ayton, who was a temporary staff with an hourly wage of 26 Australian dollars.
Sams expressed that in light of any possible violation of the anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation, he would submit his verdicts and files to the General Manager of Commission for consideration as to whether to hand Wang's case over to other agencies for further investigation of potential breaches of state or Commonwealth laws.
He added, Mr Wang didn't give Ms. Ayton any chance to respond to the alleged reasons of her dismissal.
He said, "I think the respondent has taken an irredeemably unjust and prejudiced procedure to dismiss the applicant. Mr. Wang "waited for" the opportunity, and he believed this would "justify" his terminating the employment of the applicant."
"He was wrong... The respondent had absolutely treated the applicant unfairly when she was dismissed. It was shocking that he was rude and extremely unjust."
Mr. Sams noted that although Foodworks runs a small business, "I have to be frank that no decent employer will sack their employees in an extremely unfair and careless way as acknowledged in this case."
He said, "It is shameful, and also extremely inequitable."

Staying with the country: a sketch of a formation of the Armed Police Force
It was in the golden autumn. On the parade training ground, a formation of the Armed Police Force, consisting of soldiers with an average height of 1.83 meters, were busy with training.
Shiny bayonets, unique olive-green color, and red epaulets constitute a splendid view.
A few days ago, the reporter visited this formation and learned about how these soldiers of the Armed Police Force were determined to be the loyal guards of the Communist Party and the people forever, and about their belief in and pursuit of "honor."
"Dreams shine through a brilliant life and write an eternal legend of the new age," say the lyrics of "Stay with the country," written by the soldiers of the formation collectively.
This song has become the motto of every member of the formation.
Qi Xiaoguang, who is 1.92 meters tall, is particularly impressive in the formation.
As the former flag bearer of the flag guard of the Armed Police Force, he has a deeper understanding of honor.
Soldiers' honor comes from tough training.
As a flag bearer, Qi Xiaoguang has always been trained to meet high standards and strict requirements.
He tied sandbags to himself to maintain posture, used a stopwatch to regulate his marching speed, regulated his step length with an eye fold, and improved his marching step consistency against wild wind.
In his "career of flag bearing," there was one unforgettable scene.
In a flag raising ceremony, despite the downpour, no one in the audience who came for the ceremony had left.
When the flag was raised, Qi Xiaoguang felt, from the bottom of his heart, the glory represented by the Five-starred Red Flag on his shoulder.
Qi Xiaoguang was selected as a pivot in the parade.
The standards for a pivot are different from those for a flag bearer.
Qi Xiaoguang said that, although the difference in step frequency between a flag bearer and a pivot was just over 20 steps, the training of the latter required more efforts.
A pivot is the first one in the first row and determines how orderly the whole formation is.
After the collective parade training began, he practiced kicking repeatedly every day and firmly established his strength.
In the rehearsal, his precise step length and speed won him rounds of applause from other soldiers.
In the formation, almost every soldier has the same experience with Qi Xiaoguang.
Twenty years ago, the father of the soldier Zhu Xudongfa participated the military parade at the 50th anniversary of the country on the National Day.
In order to follow his father's footsteps to join the formation, Zhu Xudongfa came across discouragement again and again, yet he never gave up.
He said, "It is my lifetime honor to be able to march through the Tiananmen Square like my father and to accept the inspection of the Party and the people. I am willing to endure any hardship."
When one walks into the formation's Room of Honors, eight big characters comes in sight, which reads, “A crack troop that safeguards the capital's stability.”
Wang Qian, political commissar of the formation, said that the soldiers of this formation all came from the Beijing City Corps, People’s Armed Police Force, a troop with a glorious tradition. They were responsible for the guard and security of the country's founding ceremony and the series of national congress of the Party, and for countering terrorism and safeguarding stability in the capital. They have also produced a great number of exemplary groups and individuals, including "National Flag Guardians" and the "National Guardian Hero Squadron." More than 50 groups and individuals were granted honorary titles by the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Armed Police Force.

Vice Premier Han Zheng attended the reception and conveyed thanks and regards on behalf of the Chinese government and President Xi Jinping to all foreign experts and international friends for their care and support for China's reform, opening up and modernization drive.

The Chinese nation has therefore achieved a tremendous transformation — it has stood up, grown rich, and become strong.
Ever since the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee led by President Xi Jinping has implemented the five-sphere integrated plan and the four-pronged comprehensive strategy, so that the Party and the country could have historic achievements and historic shifts and socialism with Chinese characteristics could cross the threshold into a new era.
China's progress in the past seven decades was the result of the unremitting efforts of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups and the hard work by foreign experts.
In the past 70 years, many foreign experts have come to China and support China's modernization drive along with the Chinese people. Their contributions are valuable and will never be forgotten by the Chinese people.
Han pointed out that China now stands at a new historical starting point in its development. The Chinese people are now securing a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, striving for the great success of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era and working tirelessly to realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.
China will continue to pursue development as the Party's top priority, talent as the most important resource and innovation as the primary force driving development. The country will carry out the innovation-driven development strategy and promote high-quality economic development.
China will support innovation by small and medium-sized enterprises and encourage the application of advances in science and technology, as the people is the most creative and energetic factor.
Han stressed that China's cause is supported by people all around the world. It learns from the world and requires cooperation with the world.
China will be more open and inclusive, always stand ready to learn from the world, and bring in more talents with a more proactive, open and effective policy.
We sincerely welcome more foreign experts to China to spark innovation and pursue successful careers. We also welcome the talents from all over the world to be part of our modernization drive and make even greater contribution to building a community with a shared future for mankind, to world peace and development and to human progress.

Vietnam should take advantage of AI to boost the economy.
In terms of the level of preparation for the coming of AI, cities were ranked based on four key criteria, including the prospect, the execution ability; the asset base and the development trajectory.
Singapore was ranked top one among all, followed by cities in the UK, the US, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
Timocine Pervane, an expert from Oliver Wyman Forum, said in an interview that "Reviewing and assessing Vietnamese cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City was meaningful.
Generally speaking, I believe that with a high growth rate, significant economic development and growing skilled workers, Vietnam has a bright prospect.
I believe Vietnam is on the right track towards the AI age.
It is important for the country to take advantage of changes produced by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to further boost its economic development."
AI is now changing how people work, communicate and live.
It brings not only higher efficiency, but also threats such as social, economic and technological inequality.
However, a research from Oliver Wyman showed that cities around the world were all prepared for the breakthroughs brought by the AI age.

About 800 million people to travel in the National Day holiday reflect the booming supply and demand of China's tourism industry
About 800 million people will travel in the upcoming "National Day" Golden Week!
Big data from a number of tourism platforms shows that the supply and demand in China's tourism consumption market are booming.
The Ctrip National Day Tourism Report predicts that with reference to the previous National Day tourism statistics, it is expected that the number of domestic tourists during the National Day holiday this year will be close to 800 million; in addition, there will be more than 7.5 million outbound tourists.
At present, there are tourists from more than 500 cities booking package tours, self-guided tours, customized tours, local entertainment and other products on the platform, involving 100 countries and regions.
According to the estimation by the China Tourism Research Institute, a total of 726 million Chinese tourists travelled across the country during last year's National Day holiday, a year-on-year increase of 9.43%.
Not only will the number of tourists climb up to a new height this year during the National Day holiday, but also the consumption upgrade will become the "main theme" of tourism in the National Day holiday.
Ctrip reports noted that the national per capita cost of cross-provincial tourism during the National Day holiday was more than 3,000 Yuan, an increase from the same period last year, as tourists generally chose products with better experience, such as high-rated brand hotels, non-shopping tour groups, exquisite private groups, special designated vehicles and guidance etc.
A similar trend was also shown by Lvmama's booking data, as for the domestic long-distance travel, a "private deluxe tour" entertaining no more than 10 tourists with comfortable vehicles serving throughout the journey is becoming more popular than in previous years.
The Spring and Autumn Tourism's data has indicated that its consumers prefer the "easy and slow" tour with emphasis on experience, service quality and differentiation.
According to the data from Flying Pigs, gross bookings from tourists in the cities of the fourth tier and below have seen the fastest growth, with a year-on-year growth rate of 30%, reflecting the consumption upgrade of household residents in more regions of the country.
Personalization is a major feature of the "National Day" Golden Week tourism this year.
According to Ctrip data, car-rental orders for self-driven tours during the National Day holiday are expected to increase by nearly 60% year-on-year, and short-distance self-driven tours to explore the surrounding niche routes continue to gain popularity; the number of private deluxe tour registrants has increased by 155% year-on-year.
Sharing the happiness has become the main purpose of people's travel and recreation activities.
Ctrip data showed that 28 percent of National Day holiday tourists are parents and children, 25 percent are couples, and 23 percent are colleagues and friends.
In terms of the tourist's age, more than 50 percent of them are born in the 1980s and 1990s.
It is noteworthy that, unlike the faster growth of outbound travels during the past Golden Weeks, the domestic travel market has shown a more "eye-catching" performance this year.
The number of people booking domestic cultural tourism routes during National Day holidays this year has increased 42 per cent year on year, outpacing the growth of outbound travel, according to data from Flying Pigs.
Industry analysis believes that while the demand goes strong, reforms on the tourism supply side will be carried out all over the country in order to bring tourists a richer diversity of "cultural tourism feasts."
For example, the General Administration of Sport and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism have jointly released the "2019 Golden Week Sports Tourism Quality Routes". The on-going 2019 Shanghai Tourism Festival is launching seven sections with 100 cultural tourism activities to attract Chinese and foreign tourists. As the Golden Week approaches, Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong and other provinces have offered discounted tickets or taken free measures in scenic spots.
Ctrip booking data has showed that destinations with unique natural scenery or cultural characteristics are the most "heated" targets in China, and Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing and Tianjin will be the most popular domestic tourist destinations.

The oldest barber in the world died at 108 years old, after 96 years of cutting hair.
Anthony Mancinelli in New York, who made it into the Guinness Book of World Record for being the oldest practicing barber, had never retired and insisted on cutting hair every day until 108. He passed away due to jaw cancer on 19th and ended his 96-year career as a barber.
As ported by CNN, Mancinelli immigrated to the United States at 8 years old. He soon began sweeping floors at a barber shop, then cutting hair at 12 to help support his family.
He attended grade school at that time but never graduated.
Mancinelli’s son Robert said that Mancinelli loved his job and people around the world loved him. Mancinelli was healthy for most of his life until he was diagnosed with cancer in February of this year. About six weeks before his death, Mancinelli didn't feel well and quit working. Yet that was not retirement as he planned to return to work after recovery.
Robert said that he got to find a barber now after the death of his father, who has had his hair cut by his father for all 82 years of his life.
Repurchases of Listed Companies Hit a Record High of Over 100 Billion Chinese Yuan - Xinhua Net
In the past two years, China's listed companies have conducted share repurchases frequently in order to stabilize the company's stock price and maintain the company's reputation. Through targeted repurchases and call auction, they hoped to pass on the information that the companies' value was underestimated, so as to stabilize the stock price and enhance investors' confidence.
According to Choice Data, a data brand under East Money Information Co Ltd., in 2017, listed companies repurchased their stocks at 7.9 billion yuan and the amount surged to 51 billion yuan in 2018. Since 2019, the total amount of share repurchases conducted by listed firms on China's A-share market has exceeded 100 billion yuan, which hit a record high and was far more than the amounts in previous years.
From the perspective of the purpose of repurchases, the repurchased stock of listed companies seemed to be the same as the shareholding increase of majority shareholders, but there are significant differences in many aspects, including the implementing subject, the source of funds, the purpose of repurchases and the equity of stocks.
During the interview, Xu Yang, Chairman of Shanghai Macro Information Consulting Co, told the reporter from Securities Daily that problems such as the narrow scope of share repurchases, the complex decision-making procedures and the incomplete inventory system had been fixed in the Opinions on Supporting the Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies issued in November 2018. Companies showed a rising appetite for buying back their own shares that year because the policy had been encouraging listed companies to conduct share repurchases.
In January this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange officially issued the Detailed Rules for the Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies. The issuing of the policies helped increase sources of funds for repurchases, appropriately simplified the implementation procedures, guided and improved governance arrangements and encouraged listed companies to conduct equity incentives or employee stock ownership plans.
After the issuing of the Opinions, share repurchases can be conducted by listed companies under more circumstances. The repurchase process has become simpler and the appetite for buying back shares has also become bigger.
Repurchasing shares at a relatively low price also helps listed companies improve the efficiency of capital use, thus increasing the level of profit earned per share and the rate of return on net assets and reducing the pressure on the company’s profitability indicators.
Compared with the increase in shareholdings by major shareholders, share repurchases by listed companies has a greater significance. Additionally, it also reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage market value and abundant cash flow.
Xu Yang believed that the underestimation of stock prices was the main factor for listed companies to conduct share repurchases. The company's stock price could no longer reflect the company's future development. Therefore, such companies were worth investors' attention. However, investors should pay more attention to the financial reports and operating conditions of those listed companies instead of making an investment blindly.
Conducting a huge amount of share repurchases has at least showed the confidence in future development and financial power of a listed company.
Listed firms on China's A-share market have shown a rising appetite for buying back their own shares. This helped normalize repurchase behavior. Data showed that almost 1,000 listed companies have completed their share repurchases this year. Leading companies in different industries have become the main force in the repurchase market.
China Ping An Insurance Company disclosed the progress of the repurchase, saying that the company has repurchased 57.59 million shares of A-shares through call auction, accounting for 0.315 percent of the company’s total capital stock. The total fund paid was 5 billion yuan, excluding transaction costs. The repurchased shares will all be used for employee stock ownership plans, including but not limited to the long-term service plan that has been reviewed and approved by the company's general meeting of shareholders.
China's dairy giant Yili has paid 5.792 billion yuan for shares repurchases and has adjusted the use of repurchase shares lately, from the original plan of "using all repurchased shares as the source of stocks for future implementation of equity incentives" to "having 183 million shares of cumulative repurchases with 152 million shares for stock incentives and 30.49 million shares for the cancellation to reduce registered capital."
Yili said that the cancellation of some of the repurchased shares would help further increase the level of profit earned per share and effectively increase the return on investment of the company's shareholders.
TCL Group issued a repurchase progress announcement on September 25th, showing that TCL Group had repurchased 3.59 percent of the company’s shares with 1.65 billion yuan.
The office of Board of Directors of TCL Group told the Securities Daily that the repurchased shares would be used for employee stock ownership plans, equity incentives or for the conversion of convertible corporate bonds issued by listed companies.
TCL Group will adhere to the established business strategy, continue to improve its competitiveness and maintain healthy development.
Based on the confidence in the company’s future development and the maintenance of investors’ interests, the company plans to conduct share repurchases with its own funds, self-raised funds and funds collected through other financing methods after reviewing the performance of the company's stock in the secondary market in the past year and taking the operating and financial conditions into consideration.
Qian Delong, Chief Economist of First Seafront Fund, said that the share repurchases of listed companies could not only significantly benefit the stock price of the secondary market by reducing the number of shares in the market and increasing the earnings per share of listed companies, but also greatly boost market confidence because listed companies would be willing to take out the real money and could buy back shares from the stock market to write off.
The repurchase of domestic listed companies has gradually increased in recent years, especially the repurchase of top-performing stocks. It is a very good way to boost investors' confidence through share repurchases and is also a practice worthy of recognition and encouragement.
The municipal party secretary of Changsha and standing committee member of Hunan provincial party committee Hu Henghua and four leaders in the construction machinery manufacturing in Hunan — — Zhan Chunxin, Liang Wengen, He Qinghua and Liu Feixiang, set up a “small target” about “Changsha, from engineering machinery to intelligent manufacturing” — — building the world-leading engineering machinery industrial cluster after three to five years.
To build the world-leading engineering machinery industrial cluster in Changsha, by using a buzzword, is to build “The Invincible.”
As the inland capital city, where does its confidence for the grandiloquence come from?
It is based on the dominant strength.
The four engineering machinery enterprises involved in this conversation are all powerful, covering all the fields of air, land and sea: SUNWARD’s light aircraft, Zoomlion’s concrete pump, Sany Heavy Industry’s all-terrain crane, and Railway Construction Heavy Industry’s shield tunneling machine for tunnel. Its “hard power” is unparalleled in the world.
Once upon a time, China barely had a voice in the field of construction machinery manufacturing
Times have changed since Chinese enterprises “brought in” and ”went out” the dual-wheel drive and took many measures including purchase, merging and building of factories with the help of the implementation of “the Belt and Road,” which made China become outstanding in the industry of engineering machinery.
Among them, the leading enterprises in the engineering machinery industry, such as Sany Heavy Industry, Zoomlion, Railway Construction Heavy Industry and SUNWARD, have preceded other similar enterprises in major economic indicators including production value, market share and sales.
It is based on the observation of various situations at different times.
The “Four Devarajas” of engineering machinery of Hunan are the star performers of the engineering machinery industrial cluster in Changsha and the leading enterprises of the global engineering machinery industry.
In the global industry, who can survive and live well will have a voice with confidence.
During the early years, the engineering machinery industry in the world was in recession. Many famous international enterprises in construction machinery manufacturing went bankrupt. Yet the construction machinery manufacturing enterprises in Changsha took this recession as a drill by adding pressure to themselves for self-breakthrough. Through the industrial structural transformation, they survived the recession and became more prosperous by transforming manufacturing into intelligent manufacturing.
It is based on the cooperation between the government and enterprises.
The development of competitive industries needs not only the enterprises’ efforts but also the government’s actions.
The reason why Changsha has a good reputation of “Capital of Engineering Machinery” is that it created a top-down full industry chain to build a number of correlated industrial clusters. By implementing many regulations and services such as optimizing business environments, improving the supporting service and simplifying approval processes, the cost of enterprises’ development, production and sales has been considerably reduced.
The good ecosystem of business makes many enterprises of construction machinery manufacturing come into being.
The history has promoted Changsha to the position for building the world-leading engineering machinery. Time waits for no man, and it is time to make a difference.
No matter the government, enterprises or even the relevant production research, should seize and take advantage of the opportunity, focus on the target, and keep on making efforts to contribute the strength from Hunan to building the manufacturing power.

At present, Africa faces the threat of terrorism and extremism. Only by solving the security issues can Africa truly realize a long-term peaceful development.
Looking forward to further coordinating the stances and increasing the solidarity and cooperation with China at the Security Council.
Wang Yi said that an important consensus had been reached at today’s meeting.
We all support the maintenance of multilateralism, the reinforcement of the authority and role of the UN, the maintenance of the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and the opposition to unilateralism and bullying; We all agree to strengthen the mutual support and cooperation between China and Africa in the affairs of the UN and Security Council, and to safeguard the common interests of China and Africa, as well as other developing countries; We all support that African countries should solve their problems in their own way, and request the financial support from the UN for the independent peace operations of Africa; We all support the idea of “Cooperation facilitates development, and development boosts peace”, helping African countries achieve sustainable development independently; We all firmly safeguard the legitimate rights of developing countries and oppose any nation creating barriers to developing countries and depriving of their rights to achieve development.
Qingyang, Gansu Province: Hu sheep brought the bible of shaking off poverty.
Loess Plateau is tinged with autumn colors of September.
In the Yimin Professional Husbandry Cooperative, the 58-year-old Xia Weili filled up the manger with the last shovel of hay and stood there, watching the white sheep slowly chewing it.
"Enjoy, and put on plenty of good fat in autumn and winter. Then you'll sell a good price when you're taken out."
Xia Weili said he fed his sheep with "special nutritious meals" every day, cleaned and disinfected the sheepfold regularly, and did his best to takes care of them.
Xia Weili has been raising sheep for more than 20 years, but he hasn't realized how crude his methods were until he started to work in the cooperative.
Xia Weili comes from Xialaochi Village, Yima Town, Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
All his neighbors are sheep farmers, but they used the traditional free-range method, which only produced sheep of poor quality and quantity.
Everything started to change in June, when 140 households in poverty in the village joined the cooperative under the guidance of the government.
Xia Weili spent all the day studying husbandry, because he had his resolutions.
Those who joined the cooperative were all in poverty. They entrusted their sheep to the cooperative and counted on him to get a good price and receive dividends at the end of the year.
Thanks to the guidance of the specialists, he gradually learned to prevent diseases and to feed the sheep in a scientific way, which made him one of the "experts" in the village.
Yimin Professional Husbandry Cooperative is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep barns and nearly 1,400 Hu sheep.
The director of the cooperative Zou Tao said that there were tricks everywhere in a standardized sheep barn.
He said, "Wool is thick and prone to grow bacteria. Hu sheep can't be left in a hot, dark, and humid place. The barn must be built on somewhere with grooves surrounding from three sides and with ventilation fans to remove the heat."
He also said, for disease prevention, the barns must be sprayed and disinfected regularly, and the sheep should be vaccinated three to four times every season.
In addition to a good living environment of the "fat little sheep," they should also be fed with a mixture of corn silage, wheat straw, alfalfa, etc., and be kept in a "playground" that is big enough for them to exercise.
The cooperative functions as a trustee that encourages local farmers to entrust their good breeds of sheep to the cooperative for unified breeding, management, and selling in order to ensure improved, scientific, standardized and intensive animal farming.
Each of the 140 households with shares in the cooperative now gets a dividend of more than RMB 6000 every year. Four people who are registered as living below the poverty line work at the cooperative.
The sheep farming in Qingyang, Gansu, has transformed from "grazing all over the hill" to "precision feeding," from "local mating" to "artificial insemination," and from the "examination of the body shape and belly" to "B-scan one by one." Moreover, the collaboration mode of "leading enterprises + cooperatives + farmers" has revolutionized the old way of "raising on the hillside and selling in the market" and resolved the problems of the traditional sheep farming that is weak, small-sized and dispersed. Farmers who used to live in poverty are living a better life because of modern sheep farming.
According to Zou Tao, if the market price is low, the local leading enterprise Gansu Zhongsheng Agriculture and Husbandry Development Company Limited will buy the sheep at the market protection price of RMB 27 per kilo to help reduce farmers’ risks.
Xu Jianfeng, the consultant of Zhongsheng Agriculture and Husbandry Development Company Limited, said the enterprise encouraged more and more households in poverty to read the bible of sheep farming by offering various services such as loan guarantees, breeding supplies, customized breeding, quote-and-buy, unified processing and selling, etc.
In Qingyang, at least 8200 households in poverty are receiving steadily increasing income by taking part in hay making, seed stock breeding, large-scale farming, slaughtering and cutting, and market sales organized by Zhongsheng.
Qingyang is located in a farming-pastoral zone in the north that is rich in forage resources.
There are 913 large-scale sheep barns and cooperatives with more than 5 million sheep and two processing lines with the slaughtering and cutting capacity of 1.3 million sheep, making sheep farming the leading business for poverty alleviation in the city.
French Finance Minister claims a tax deduction of over 10 billion euros and calls on Germany to follow up.
Paris (Reuters) September 26 - French Finance Minister (Bruno Le Maire) said on Thursday that France will deduct over 10 billion euros next year (equals to 10.9 billion US dollars), and Germany should follow up this step of fiscal stimulus to revive the downturn economy.
In his introduction of the financial budget of France in 2020, Le Maire claimed that the latest monetary easing measures implemented by the European Central Bank had created an opportunity to increase investment for the EU member states that can afford it.
The European Central Bank cut their interest rate to the lowest record on September 12 and planned to restart purchasing debt, so as to drive down the borrowing costs, hoping to stimulate economic recovery and boost the inflation rate.
“Low interest rate will not help Europe to resume prosperity, monetary measures are very necessary but not enough,”Le Maire told the reporters.
“Germany needs to make investment. They need it now, the earlier the better. Don’t wait until the situation gets worse to take actions,” Le Maire added.
He has made such appeal to Germany for several times.
This year, France has implemented tax cuts in excess of 10 billion euros and it has brought a big boost to the economic growth of the country.
However, when the global economy lost its momentum, the economy of Germany bears the brunt because it depends on export.
Le Maire pointed out that the French family tax burden will reduce 9.3 billion euros next year. This includes an income tax relief of 5 billion euros.
In addition, with the gradual fulfillment of the corporate tax rate deduction from 33.3% to 25% within 5 years, corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly 1 billion euros.
The General Secretary of Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, recently made important instructions about the protection of the memorial facilities of martyrs. He stressed the importance of the reinforcement the planning, construction, repairing，management and maintenance work within martyrs' ceremonies.
To implement in depth the instructions of the General Secretary and push forward the protection and management of the memorial facilities of martyrs, the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, the General Office of the State Council, and the General Office of the Central Military Commission issued The Overall Work Plan for the Management and Maintenance of the Planning, Construction, Repair and Maintenance of the Martyr Memorial Facilities a few days ago.
The Overall Work Plan serves as the programmatic document to guide the protection and management of the memorial facilities of martyrs. The Plan is explicit about the target tasks for the protection and management work. It requires that the memorial facilities of martyrs should be well planned and constructed, and the Red Education system should be improved so as to promote heroic spirits; the memorial facilities should be well repaired and protected to create the atmosphere of respecting heroes and remembering their merits; the facilities should also be well managed and maintained, and a normative as well as self-contained system of organization, support and management should be formed.
The Plan guides to enhance the repairing and protection of the memorial facilities of martyrs on the basis of the overall arrangement and long-term vision. To practically carry forward the work, the Plan points out the necessity to improve the leadership mechanism, policies and regulations; to organize and implement the quality improvement projects, to upgrade facilities and equipment, and to strengthen service ability; to increase the overall performance by optimizing exhibition contents and inaugurate new exhibition methods.
The Plan stresses to improve the regulation system and the organizational support. It stresses to intensify the organizational leadership by establishing a working mechanism led by the Ministry of Veterans Affairs, actively cooperated by the concerned departments, and widely participated by the whole society; to implement the law of martyr protection, improve the regulation-making system, and persistently advance the institutionalization, standardization and specialization of the planning, construction, management and maintenance of martyrs memorial facilities; to strengthen the team building by introducing volunteer service and by encouraging the active participation of veterans, families of martyrs, experts, scholars and young students into the interpretation and order maintenance of martyr memorial facilities; and to improve the social participation mechanism according to the government-led and multiple sources of investment principle, by actively advocating and encouraging enterprises, social organizations and individuals to provide donations and support for the repair and protection of martyr memorial facilities.
Study: U.S. national healthy diet index increases slightly, but still face challenges-ECNS
ECNS, September 27. According to a report by uschinapress.com, a recent study in the United States has shown that the U.S. government's healthy diet index has grown moderately from 56 to 58 in the past 16 years.
Considering that a maximum score is 100, this is no cause for celebration.
Americans still face "significant challenges" in their diets.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Fangfang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said that Americans still consume too much food that may cause heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other diseases, which are the most common diseases of American citizens are suffering.
The research was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on the 24th.
The study is based on the conclusions of a health survey of 44,000 adults conducted by the US government from 1999 to 2016.
"Despite considerable improvement, significant dietary challenges still exist," the authors write.
It is reported that these challenges include allowing US nationals to reduce their intake of snacks, hot dogs, beef cattle, butter and other foods containing saturated fats.
The study found that people's daily dietary intake of these unhealthy fats has increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended upper limit of 10%.
The biggest improvement in the American diets is the reduction of sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but the intake remains still too high.
Officials believe that the daily intake of added sugar should be less than 10%.
The researchers believe that the reason for the reduction in intake of sugar has been linked to the reduction of people drinking sweet soda, but Zhang Fangfang emphasized that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and tomato sauce.
Adults in the United States have seen a slight increase in their intake of fruits, nuts, oats and other whole grain foods.
However, 2016 data shows that these foods still make up less than 5 percent of the daily diet.
Although people's intake of salt is slightly reduced, drinking less fruit juice has led to the intake of low-quality carbohydrates, Zhang Fangfang said that they still account for up to 42% of daily calories, much of which comes from refined white bread and other refined grains.
This study is based on personal health surveys that take place every two years, which will ask adults to recall what kind of foods they ate in the past 24 hours.
The health surveys have been asking this question twice every few days since 2003.
The government's dietary guidelines for American citizens recommend the people to adopt a "healthy diet pattern” to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
The guidelines point out that people should consume more nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, as well as seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs, and seed foods that can provide proteins.
During the research, the number of people with diabetes in the United States has nearly doubled to more than 7%, and the obesity rate has also increased over the years in between the surveys; about 70% of American adults are now overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States.
The EU is promoting a strategic partnership with Asia.
Nguyen Van Binh, Member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee, Member of the Secretariat of the CPV Central Committee and Head of the CPV Central Committee Department for Economic Affairs, led a delegation to attend the forum.
Based on the close cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the forum was given a theme of "EU-Asia Connectivity Forum - Building Bridges for a Sustainable Future".
The forum will be held a year after the implementation of the strategy for EU-Asia connectivity.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that strengthening connectivity was part of the proposition because it would benefit the people and economies in related countries.
The relations will help bring stability and prosperity to all countries concerned.
He also believed that the EU hoped to share an idea of promoting participation and strengthening mutually beneficial relationship between Europe and Asia.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will deliver a keynote speech at the plenary session as a special guest of the forum.
Wealth management subsidiary of China's first joint-stock commercial bank established, technology applied to promote asset management business
On the 26th, China Everbright Bank(CEB) set up its wholly-owned subsidiary Everbright Wealth Management Co. Ltd. in Qingdao, China's eastern Shandong province, making CEB the first joint-stock bank to set up a unit to manage wealth management products (WMPs).
Experts said that asset management is an important field for the development of financial technology. The establishment of a wealth management subsidiary would be beneficial for a bank to use technology to enhance its asset management business.
In April this year, CEB and China Merchants Bank(CMB) issued announcements respectively, saying that they had been approved by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission to prepare for the establishment of wealth management subsidiaries.
On September 24th, CEB announced that Everbright Wealth Management had officially been approved to open.
In just two days, CEB became the leader of many joint-stock banks by establishing Everbright Wealth Management in Qingdao.
Chairman of Everbright Group Li Xiaopeng said that Everbright Group would accelerate innovation. By using modern technological thinking and methods, relying on big data, Internet of Things, cloud computing, Everbright Group would increase the coverage, utilization and penetration rate of financial capital and improve clients' senses of acquisition, happiness and security.
By 2021, China will establish and improve the framework of China's development of financial technology, further develop the application of technology in the financial industry, achieve deep integration and coordinated development of finance and technology and significantly enhance people's satisfaction with digital, network-based and intelligent financial products and services.
Chairman of Everbright Wealth Management Zhang Xuyang introduced that new technologies such as intelligent investment advisers, intelligent investment research and big data would be applied to the asset management platform of Everbright Wealth Management and would help Everbright Wealth Management to make a better judgement on the macroeconomic situation.
In the future, Everbright Wealth Management will use new technologies such as blockchain to grasp the developing direction and trend from traditional assets to alternative assets, then to digital alternative assets.
Dong Ximiao, special researcher of the National Institution for Finance and Development, said that the asset management industry was facing new competitions and cooperations. Therefore, fin-tech companies and asset management institutions would explore new ways of development by using new related technologies.
Financial technology promotes the development of the asset management industry, This will not only meet the need for the transformation and development of financial technology, but also bring new vitality and energy to the development of asset management business.
Early this year, JD Digital Technology Holding Co. Ltd. launched a new asset management technology system, which could promote the research and development of asset management products and improve the ability to control risks with the help of technological and digital methods.
The new system helps enhance the overall level of intelligent operation of the asset management industry with the abilities to design products, conduct sales and trading process, manage assets and assess risks.
Experts believed that the application of asset management technology would not only help provide better services and more innovative products for clients, but also improve the ability to prevent risks and the efficiency of asset management.
Zhang Xuyang said that in the past, questionnaires had been used to obtain clients' risk appetite, but the result may not be accurate. The use of artificial intelligence in user portraits would help define a client, launch products according to clients' investment preferences and resolve risks.
"Alternative big data such as e-commerce and spatio-temporal data can help us better characterize the liveliness and prospect of a region or an industry."
Zhang Xuyang said that in addition to risk resolving, big data could also help improve the ability to control risks.
The record for the deepest shaft in China's railway tunnels has been broken
Baoshan, China News Service, September 27 (Zhang Weiming, Xu Weiguo, Zhou Jingbo) After more than 1,200 days of overnight constructions, the excavation and masonry of Gaoligongshan Tunnel No.1 shaft of the Dali-Ruili Railway which is still under construction has been completed on the 27th. Under the circumstances that there was a massive water inrush, they had claimed the record for the deepest shaft construction in China's railway tunnels by reaching a new depth of 762.59 meters below the ground.
Located in Yunnan province, the 34.5km Darei Railway Gaoligongshan Tunnel crosses the Gaoligong mountains from the west bank of the Nujiang River, making it the longest single-hole two-track tunnel in Asia.
This tunnel traverses 19 fault zones and has a maximum burial depth of 1155 meters. Because it covers almost all the poor geological conditions and major risks that a tunnel construction may encounter, Gaoligongshan Tunnel is called the "geological museum" of tunnel construction.
As the most important auxiliary tunnel of Gaoligongshan Tunnel, the shaft is responsible for increasing the operation areas to realize the important task of "building a long tunnel by means of driving from construction entries" and the ventilation of railway operation in a later stage.
Shaft No.1 has been successfully excavated to the very bottom, marking that Gaoligongshan Tunnel has officially entered into the stage of horizontal tunnel construction. After completing the excavation of the shaft station and replacing the necessary equipment, four additional operating areas can be added under the shaft to speed up the excavation of the main tunnel.
"The vertical shafts are all in granite formations. Because there are many fractures in the granite formations, the water cannot stop flowing from top to bottom. Basically, the pressure is as deep as the shaft goes."
Si Jingzhao, the chief engineer of the Darui Railway Project Department of China Railway Tunnel Bureau, told reporters that during the construction of the shaft there were many dangers such as muddy water inrush and collapses. The construction contractor had invited the experts to inspect and review on the spot and discuss the solutions more than 20 times.
"At its peak, the maximum water inflow gushing in the shaft reached over 300 cubic meters per hour. At the bottom of the 700-meter-deep shaft, the water pressure was equivalent to the sea floor at a depth of 700 meters".
Si Jingzhao said, "If drainage is not done in time, the shaft will be flooded 10 meters every hour. We spend almost 85% of our time on water control and 15% of the time on tunneling".
In order to overcome geological problems such as the development of longitudinal joints in surrounding rocks of No.1 shaft, bursts of muddy water, water-rich granite, and other geological problems, a series of water control measures combined with "exploration, injection, and excavation" are taken in tunnel construction to reduce the construction risk.
With many improvements, mechanized assembly lines such as excavation system, ballast discharging system, suspension system and winch lifting system have been set up in the construction of No.1 shaft, realizing the full-flow mechanized operations such as drilling, blasting, ballast discharging, formwork installation and concrete pouring, thus speeding up the construction progress.
In the end, after more than 1,200 days and nights of construction, the shaft was successfully excavated to a depth of 762.59 meters.
The Darui Railway, with a total length of 330 kilometers, is an important part of the China-Myanmar International Corridor and an important transportation infrastructure for the implementation of the "Belt And Road" construction.
After it is completed and put into service, the driving time from Dali to Ruili will be shortened from 6 hours to 2 hours on the current highway, which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in the western Yunnan region and play an important role in promoting economic and trade cooperation as well as the friendly exchanges between China and South Asian and Southeast Asian countries.
Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor: the Chinese people should be proud of the country's achievements
Press circles of Hong Kong celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Reception to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China was held by the press circles on the 27th in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor addressed the reception. She said that "China's achievements in the past 70 years are obvious to all. We are all proud of it as a Chinese."
Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, Deputy Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government (LOCPG) in the Hong Kong Lu Xinning, Deputy Commissioner of the Office of The Commissioner of The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of The People's Republic Of China in The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Song Ru'an, Deputy Political Commissar of the PLA garrison in Hong Kong Chen Yading and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Preparation Committee of Hong Kong Press Circles Celebrating to the National Day Jiang Zaizhong were invited as guests to the reception.
Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor pointed out that China has been bravely moving forward and making progress and has overcome several difficulties and challenges. China's achievements in the past 70 years are obvious to all. The Chinese people should all be proud of it.
Hong Kong has been sticking together, making progress and sharing fruits with the mainland of China ever since its return to the motherland.
She believes that by implementing the principles of "One Country, Two Systems", Hong Kong will make the most of its advantages, grasp the opportunities brought by the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and seek for a better future.
She also said that social disputes have never stopped in Hong Kong in the past few months. The situation has been affecting every single person in Hong Kong. People working in press circles are also facing challenges.
At this special time, she hopes that friends in the press circles can press forward in face of difficulties and be professional so as to provide fair and reasonable news reports for the society and bring rational communication back to Hong Kong for the region's bright future.
Jiang Zaizhong pointed out that China's glorious past is also Hong Kong's past when the region developed, made progress and shared weal or woe with the motherland.
This is especially true after Hong Kong's return to the motherland. The central government has been fully and faithfully implementing the principles of "One Country, Two Systems", "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy. Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland have stuck together for a common cause, kept watch for and helped defend one another, reached a mutual benefit and win-win situation and achieved great success in economic development.
Therefore, the Hong Kong press circles had this happy gathering to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China together.
He said that in the past three months, there had been so much violence in Hong Kong. People broke the law and destroyed social stability blatantly. Many news media bendt the truth and published misleading reports, which actually added fuel to the fire.
He appeals to the media to drive out evil and usher in good and create a good environment where people resist violence and defend laws.
Professionals in the press circles should conform to the norms, lead citizens away from violence with true reports and responsible words and defend the dignity and justice of the law.
Around 500 people from the press circles and other walks of life attended the reception. They all toasted the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China along with the main guests.
According to the Publicity Ministry of the Municipality Party Committee of Xining, the city will implement "Regulations for promoting civilized behavior in Xining" from October 1, focusing on 15 types of uncivilized behavior such as ignoring the traffic lights and throwing objects from inside a building. The new regulations list key issues to be dealt with and state corresponding punishment.

Family from UK trapped in France for five days after the car key fell into a lake
A couple from Wales were trapped in France with their two children for five days during their vacation in France. Their car key fell into a lake accidentally and it took them five days to get a new key from the car producer.
The couple then left France with the two kids.
According to the news report, on September 16th local time, the family were rowing a boat on a lake in France when the daughter knocked over a bag and the car key fell into the lake.
They spent hours looking for the key but ended up finding nothing.
All their belongings and cash were locked in the car.
Although they had bought insurance before coming to France, the insurance company refused to help because they believed that car was not in danger of being stolen.
This left them no choice but to hire a truck to tow the car to an auto repair workshop and order a new key from the car producer.
A few days later, they got the new key and were finally able to leave France.
Unfortunately, all their bookings on the trip were canceled due to the loss of the key.

Carry out a pilot program to apply the system of notification and commitment to licensing low-risk food production and delegate the power of representative offices of foreign enterprises to the Free Trade Zone
On the 27th, the Market Supervision and Regulation Bureau of Shanghai Municipality signed a working memorandum with the People's Government of Pudong New Area to introduce 20 reform measures relating to market supervision and regulation. Some of the measures will be firstly piloted nationwide.
It is introduced that the system of notification and commitment requires the administrative authority to notify the applicant of conditions and requirements in laws and regulations in a written form when handling license registrations.
After the applicant signs the commitment, the administrative authority may directly handle the registration.
According to the memorandum, the Market Supervision and Regulation Bureau of Shanghai Municipality will support the Pudong New Area and Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone in carrying out a pilot program to apply the system of notification and commitment in three areas including the registration of the name of enterprises, licensing simply processed food and low-risk food production and giving approval to some types of measurement instruments, in order to provide enterprises with easier market access.
Shanghai Shao Wansheng Food Co., Ltd. obtained a Food Production License immediately through the system of notification and commitment on the 27th and became the first enterprise to enjoy the pilot dividend.
The head of the company said that a Food Production License can be issued immediately on the day of applying. Enterprises are even allowed to submit only part of the materials specified in the plan of the system of the notification and commitment within a time limit. "We do feel the convenience brought by the reform. "
The Market Supervision and Regulation Bureau of Shanghai Municipality said that the implementation of the notification and commitment system for the food production license is the first pilot in the country.
After the reform, the examination and approval process has been reduced from the previous six processes of "registration, acceptance, on-site verification, sampling examination, material review and approval and licensing" to four processes of "registration, acceptance and approval and licensing". All the processes can be handled in one day compared with the previous 20 working days.
Pudong has a highly export-oriented economy. Taking this into consideration, the Market Supervision and Regulation Bureau of Shanghai Municipality delegate the power of permanent representative institutions of foreign (regions) enterprises to the Free Trade Zone, so that enterprises can choose to obtain a license nearby.
Statistics show that 1,592 permanent representative institutions in the Free Trade Zone are involved in the delegation of power in total and 99 of the institutions have handled the service in accordance with the new regulations.
Survey on China's National Day holiday consumption: people are having more choices, but tourism is the most popular
With the National Day holiday, or the "golden week", approaching, people are finalizing their plans.
A reporter from Securities Daily conducted a survey on people's National Day holiday plan in WeChat's Moments and received 20 feedbacks. People are having different plans, but "travel + shopping" has become the keyword for the National Day holiday.
To be specific, half of the people choose to go on a trip during the holiday according to the survey carried out by the reporter from Securities Daily.
Mr Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said that "The whole family is planning to go to Shanghai during the National Day holiday. We made Shanghai Disneyland our first stop before travelling to neighbouring cities." Ms Li, who lives in China's capital Beijing, chooses to travel to China's Taiwan province with her family. "We three are planning to go on September 28th and spend ten days travelling all over the island," she said. aMs Ma from Chongqing makes a plan for outbound travel with Singapore as her destination. Mr Zhang from China's northern Hebei province plans for a road trip with his family. He said that "It will be quite difficult for us to travel far since my daughter's only one year old, so we're going to Shandong by car and spend a few days by the sea."
The Report on Residents' Travel Trends for the Golden Week of the National Day of 2019 issued jointly by online travel agencies Tongcheng Yilong and Tongcheng Travel shows that the consumption will witness an upgrade in the transportation, hotel and tourism industry during the golden week.
The marketing penetration rates of aeroplanes and high-speed railways are steadily growing. The needs for star hotels and non-standard accommodations, such as apartments, inns and B&Bs, account for a higher percentage of all needs for accommodations.
The 2019 China’s Tourism Consumption Trends for the National Day Golden Week issued by China's leading e-commerce platform for services Meituan on September 23th shows that tourism consumption remains high and food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment consumption are all upgrading.
More young people prefer quality tourism and special experiences. Cultural tourism and night tourism are becoming more popular.
Besides, consumer demand is also going to grow during the National Day holiday.
Mr Wang from Chengdu told the reporter from Securities Daily that "Buying a car is my main priority during the holiday."
An employee from a 4S car shop in Beijing told Securities Daily that usually, September to October is the "golden period" for car sales each year.
Bricks and mortar shops are going to launch sales promotions during the National Day holiday, such as lottery drawing and price reductions.
Moreover, many car companies have launched new models recently. It is estimated that this will significantly promote car sales.
People are now focusing more on satisfying spiritual needs, thus the increase in culture, education and other services consumption.
Ms Du from Beijing said that "Culture and education consumption has always accounted for a high percentage ever since the child was born."
Children are given so many plans during the National Day holiday, such as going to planetariums and children theatres. Several families are planning to pitch tents and go camping in the Elk Museum. Children are also going to attend some trial classes during the holiday.
Experts said that theoretically speaking, the consumption upgrade is a process of switching from surviving-target consumption to development-target consumption and enjoyment-target consumption. Service consumption accounts for a high percentage of enjoyment-target consumption.
With the growth in China's economy and people's income, people will focus more on spiritual-level consumption. Travelling is a good choice for them.
This is especially true during the National Day holiday when people are having more time to go travelling and shopping. This will not only meet the consumer demand but also reflect consumption upgrades.
I had felt lonely since the afternoon, but I didn’t want to go out. I hadn’t adjusted my state without my kids around me.
Bracing myself up, I said to my dog Nana: Mom will take you out.
I wrote down some things that need to be handled in detail. The characteristics of blood type A were increasingly obvious so that I even felt uncomfortable myself.
Picking up the suit, paying the bills, buying the nutrition caplets, raw fish and snacks for Nana.
The above is the reason for going out.
I just told my young sister Aiqiang on the phone that thanks to Nana, I had excuses to buy snacks.
She laughed perfunctorily and hung up because her kids were coming around.
Nana jumped in the passenger’s side deftly and got down quietly. She was scared of her carsickness, but she wanted to keep me company.
Unusually for my husband Boao, he came back very early.
He kept praising that the salad with salmon and avocado was tasteful and then watched television on the bed in the bedroom.
I looked at the clock on the wall, it was just seven. The land of the rising sun also had an early sunset. The sky had already gotten dark.
Friends were all posting the bright moon. It was mid-autumn.
I washed a bunch of grapes sent by friends and left half of them to Aobo. I put the other half into the bowl with floral prints that I liked and enjoyed them while watching the moon.
Sitting on the ground with Nana, I ate the grapes while she ate the skin. Then I put forth my strength to spit the seeds far away.
The moon hid in the cloud which was moving, so the moon was flickering and a bit dazzling.
I came up with many poems about the moon, but I only liked this line: Tis what time three meets five, selene is a globe! Her pure rays fill the court, the jade-like rails enrobe! Lo! In the heavens her disk to view doth now arise, and in the earth below to gaze men lift their eyes.
We might have endowed the moon with too much affection. For me now, actually, "Pay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and God what belongs to God," might be the best.
Moonlight is moonlight, the mood belongs to yourself.
After having the grapes, I felt the coldness from the moon.
Nana was snoring slightly next to my feet. I stood up and put her little blanket beside her small house. Nana lied down happily on the blanket.
He pulled the door open and yelled: is the bath water ready?
I couldn’t see the moon from the window of bathroom, but I could feel the moonlight after turning off the light and opening up the window.
We didn’t have the mooncake or alcohol.

Will Malaysian Chinese Association run for the by-election of the seat of People's Assembly at Tanjung Piai in Johor?
The President of Malaysian Chinese Association Wee Ka Siong said: “We will leave it to the Supreme Court of National Front!”
The Tanjung Piai by-election for the Dewan Rakyat seat is around the corner, whether Malaysian Chinese Association which is the member party of National Front will be elected for this traditional seat of People's Assembly has been brought into focus.
However, the Central Committee of Malaysian Chinese Association held a conference and announced that they would leave the decision to the Supreme Court of National Front on whether the seat would be gained by Malaysian Chinese Association or other member parties.
After presiding over the conference of the Central Committee of Malaysian Chinese Association in the afternoon on Thursday, Wee Ka Siong told the media that the National Front would base any by-elections on the standard operation procedure (SOP). That is, it cannot be decided until the conference is held by the Supreme Court of National Front.
He said the conference of the Supreme Court of National Front is expected to take place at the beginning of October, because the Election Committee would not hold a conference to make decisions about relevant issues on Tanjung Piai by-election for the seat of People's Assembly until next Monday (1st).
“Yesterday (26th) morning, I also met with the chairman of the National Front Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, and we both agreed that we should regain this seat from Alliance of Hope.”
“We decided to hold a special conference for the leaders of the National Front at the beginning of October, and the chairmen of three Parties in the National Front decide which member party will be elected.”
When asked whether Malaysian Chinese Association would urge the Supreme Court of National Front to elect it, Wee Ka Siong reiterated that he would rely on the standard operation procedure as President of Malaysian Chinese Association, so they must reach a consensus with the National Front before making any decisions.
“It is commonplace for someone running for any by-elections and the political parties also think they should do that.”
“The most important is that to which organization and political union do we belong?”
“This will be a good test of our political union and we believe that the National Front has kept something valuable through the whole journey.”
“In this process, it is normal for someone to say something.”
“However, the most important is that we should try our best once the Supreme Court of National Front makes a decision.”
“Anyway, Wee Ka Siong expressed that Malaysian Chinese Association would spare no efforts to prepare for the coming Tanjung Piai by-election based on three levels, namely the District, Joint Committee of the State and the Center.”
“The District will be led by the Chairman of the (Tanjung Piai) District Wee Jeck Seng”; the Joint Committee of the State will be led by the Acting Chairman of the Johor Joint Committee Lin Peixing; the Center will be deployed by the Acting President of Malaysian Chinese Association Ma Hanshun and the Secretary General Zhang Shengwen.”
Last Saturday (21st), the senator of Malaysia United Indigenous Party of Tanjung Piai, Muhamad Farid Saad, died of a heart attack in Pontian Hospital at the age of 42.
A villager at Baokang County in Hubei was punished by “patrolling the mountains voluntarily” due to hunting wildlife.
A villager at Baokang County in Hubei was sentenced due to hunting wildlife. In the meanwhile, he was punished by losing 15420 Yuan (RMB, the same below) as the compensatory payment for repairing the ecological environment.
Since the defendant is poor, the procuratorial organs use labor camp to replace the compensatory payment for repairing the ecological environment, realizing the organic unity of legal and social effect.
On 27th, Wang Zhongliang, the vice procurator of Baokang County’s procuratorate, said that the defendant Mr. Zhou has build a deep emotional bond with the wild macaque and felt guilty about his previous action of hunting animals after “patrolling the mountains voluntarily” and other labors for three months.
In June 21 this year, a criminal and civil public benefit case on the field of ecological resources was initiated by Baokang County’s procuratorate and was put on public trial with the judgment being passed in court.
The defendant Mr. Zhou was sentenced to three years' imprisonment with four years’ probation and a penalty of 3000 Yuan. Meanwhile, he was punished by losing 15420 Yuan as the compensatory payment for repairing the ecological environment.
Through investigation, Mr. Zhou had started setting up the power grid in the mountains since January in 2014 and hunted more than 20 wild animals, including goral, muntjac and elaphodus cephalophus.
Goral is the second-class national protected wild animals that are endangered, while muntjac and elaphodus cephalophus are classified into the National Protection List of Terrestrial Wild Animals.
In the court trial, Mr. Zhou confess everything about his corpus delicti and was willing to take the additional civil responsibilities.
Given the poor economic condition of Mr. Zhou’s family, the local village committee, forestry depot and Mr. Zhou reached a tripartite agreement under the coordination of Baokang County’s procuratorate, using labor camp to replace the compensatory payment for repairing the ecological environment. That is, Mr. Zhou provides public services such as domesticating and looking after macaques at the conservation area of macaques, patrolling the mountains voluntarily, and protecting the forest for one year, to compensate for the cost of ecological remediation.
The court approved the proposal from the procurator and agreed that Mr. Zhou actively performs his duty to work as a compensation for the cost of ecological remediation during his probation.
So far, Mr. Zhou has voluntarily worked at the conservation area of macaques for three months with good performance in actively patrolling the mountains.
In recent years, Baokang County’s procuratorate has organically integrated procuratorial functions into social governance in practice through the scientific use of procuratorial suggestions, investigation supervision of proceedings and so on, minimizing the damage to ecological environment caused by criminal acts with the help of judicial measure.
Ant Forest was honored with the Champions of the Earth award by the United Nations
Amid warm applause and magnificent music, the Ant Forest project leader Xu Di and user representative Shen Junliang walked onto the podium to take over the trophy of the 2019 United Nations "Champions of the Earth" from the host's hands.
The "Ant Forest", a project that leveraged mobile applets to encourage hundreds of millions of people to participate in environmental protection activities, had been recognized in the "Inspiration and Action" category at the "2019 Champions of the Earth" award ceremony held in New York, USA on the 26th.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Program had announced the list of winners at its headquarter in Nairobi, Kenya, but the people who participated in the award ceremony on that day were still unable to contain their excitement.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Inge An Nuosheng, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program, said, "Ant Forest" is an exciting innovation that enables hundreds of millions of people to take actions and understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans can do for the environment.
By leveraging technology to connect people with the environment, it allows every individual to take part in the actions to protect planet earth, which will have a huge impact.
Launched by China Ant Financial Services Group (Ant Financial Services for short) on Alipay platform in August 2016, "Ant Forest" allows users to accumulate "green energy" and "plant virtual trees" in their mobile phones by taking low-carbon actions such as recording the green footprints in their daily lives, paying utility bills online etc.
Every time the user has developed a virtual tree, "Ant Forest" and its non-profit partners will plant a real tree in the desert area.
As of August this year, 500 million "Ant Forest" users had reduced carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in the desert areas.
In the "Champion of the Earth Awards" honored that day, Costa Rica had taken its reward for its national environmental efforts. The Costa Rica President Carlos Alvarado who came to receive the award hailed the contributions made by Ant Forest on the spot, which he said "is impressive to inspire so many people to take part in green actions."
Jing Xiandong, the chairman and chief executive officer of Ant Financial Service Group, said that the "Champion of the Earth Award " was a nod to the Ant Forest Initiative.
Technologies and open platforms made it possible for everyone to participate in the low-carbon life, and the honor belongs to all participants.
Jing Xiandong said that the "Ant Forest" has affected 500 million people in the past three years, and the goal of the "Ant Forest" in the next three years is to drive 1 billion people worldwide to participate in low-carbon actions.
While fighting against desertification and protecting the environment, they were also exploring ways to bring the farmers more earnings from green mountains and clear waters.
In addition to providing job opportunities of planting trees, they also wished to help farmers increase their income with agricultural product development projects and e-commerce platforms.
The model of public environmental protection created by Ant Forest based on digital technology has also been successfully launched out overseas and followed by other countries.
In June this year, the largest "electronic wallet" in the Philippines GCash had rolled out the Philippine version of "Ant Forest" to encourage Filipino users to better protect the environment through a low-carbon lifestyle.
According to reports, GCash will work together with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and non-commercial environmental organizations to plant 365,000 trees in the territory of Philippines one year after the project is launched.
The Champions of the Earth is the United Nations' top-level environmental honor which is awarded once a year.
Ant Forest's winning of the award came in the third consecutive year that a green innovation initiative from China has been recognized in the "Incentive and Action" category, following the Saihanba Forestation Community Project and the Zhejiang Green Rural Revival Program in China.
Economic and trade friction affects the US economy
The report on the US economy in the second quarter of this year showed that the growth rate of the US gross domestic product (GDP) significantly slowed down from the previous quarter due to the huge decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts pointed out that the economic and trade friction and the uncertainties brought by it were the main factors behind the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data released by the US Department of Commerce on the 26th showed that the US GDP in the second quarter of this year grew at an annual rate of two percent, which was the same as the previously revised data, but was significantly lower than the 3.1 percent in the first quarter.
Data showed that consumption growth was the main contributor to US economic growth in the second quarter.
The personal consumption expenditure, which accounted for about 70 percent of the US economy, increased by 4.6 percent quarter-on-quarter, promoting economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
Additionally, the government consumption expenditure and investment drove up the economy by 0.82 percentage points.
However, investment in private sectors dropped by 6.3 percent in the second quarter from the previous one, dragging down the economy by 1.16 percentage points in the quarter. Exports fell by 5.7 percent from the previous quarter and the net exports dragged the economy down by 0.68 percentage points in the quarter.
Barry Knapp, the managing partner at the US-based Ironsides Macroeconomics, said that investment in private sectors failed to maintain the growth rate of last year. Instead, it showed a sharp decline because of a lack of confidence in companies caused by the economic and trade friction and the rising uncertainties.
Knapp believed that due to the influence of uncertainty in policies, the capital expenditures of US enterprises were expected to continue to decline next year.
Analysts believed that consumption growth had become a strong support for the US economy in the second quarter, but there were more signs indicating that the economic and trade friction and the uncertainties caused had already affected consumer confidence and had brought negative impacts on the US consumer outlook.
Richard Curtin, head of the survey and a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, said that in the latest survey, 38 percent of the consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impacts that tariffs had on the US economy. The proportion hit a new high in one and a half years.
Regarding the future of the US economy, analysts believed that it would continue to slow down.
However, there were also some experts saying that if the economic and trade friction were alleviated, the performance of the US industrial sector and the financial market would be better.
Cailin Birch, an economist of the Economist Intelligence Unit(EIU) predicted that in the future, the US economy would continue this year's downward trend and its growth rate would drop to a lower level compared with the rate in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Corporation, predicted that if the economic and trade friction would not be more serious, the US economic growth rate this year would be 2.3 percent and would further slow down to 1.6 percent next year.
The investment manager of Putnam Investments pointed out that the biggest concern of enterprises was the economic and trade dispute and the uncertainty brought by it. If the dispute could be resolved, the uncertainty would be greatly reduced and the performance of the industrial sector would be much better.
Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said that the economic and trade friction is still the "primary problem" and the main reason for the large fluctuations in the US capital market this year. Whether the economic and trade friction can be properly resolved will be the key to the future of US capital markets in the rest of the year.
The parental leave is available to both husband and wife in Ningxia for the first time and parents whose children are at the age from 0 to 3 can take a ten-day leave every year
The guarantee of women’s legal rights reflects the respect and guarantee of human rights, as well as the important sign of development of social civilization.
On the 15th conference of the 12th National People’s Congress in September 27, The Regulation On The Protection Of Women's Rights And Interests in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was passed with an overwhelming majority of votes
This is the first local regulation formulated and issued by Ningxia at the provincial level to safeguard women’s legal rights in a systematic way. It will be officially implemented in November 1, 2019.
It is reported that the Regulation passed this time is a revision on the Ningxia’s Measures For The Implementation of The People’s Republic Of China’s Law On The Protection Of Women's Rights And Interests in 2007, which is divided into nine chapters and sixty-five items, including general principles, political right, right to cultural education, right to labor and social security, property right, personal right, marriage and family rights, legal liability, and supplementary principles.
In the Regulation, Ningxia encourages the exploration and implementation of entitling both husband and wife to take parental leave, which is unprecedented in the whole country.
In April this year, the General Office of the State Council issued The Guidance Of Improving Caring Services For Children Under The Age of Three has relevant description of the parental leave for both husband and wife.
When revising the Regulation, Ningxia innovatively proposed that “employers are encouraged to grant a ten-day parental leave to both husband and wife annually, as long as their fertility behaviors are legitimate and their children are at the age from 0 to 3.”
At the same time, Regulation highlights the anti-sexual harassment the protection for girls.
The 43rd item of the Regulation lists detailed rules on what constitutes sexual harassment and the main measures to prevent it based on the updated legislative achievements of Chinese Civil Code and Personal Rights.
The 44th item of the Regulation bans the vicious incident of sexual assault aimed at little girls that was frequently occurred and requires educational organizations to impart relevant information on protection and prevention to it, which becomes the new benchmark for local legislation to protect little girls.
Aiming at women’s rights to know and decide the joint estate of marriage and family, the 35th item in the Regulation clearly stipulates that women have the right to know the joint estate and property registration as well as the duty for related parties, providing firm institutional support for women to safeguard their legal right.
In addition, aiming at the social hot spot — — the gender discrimination at workplace, the 26th item of the Regulation not only bans direct discrimination but also indirect discrimination. Drawing on the updated practical experience of joint meeting, it reinforces effects of punishment for the criminal acts gender discrimination, firmly safeguarding women’s legal right.
In recent years, the organs of public security, procuratorate and court of the Women's Federation in Ningxia and civil administration departments have achieved remarkable success in employing social professions to mediate in the marriage and family conflicts and oppose the family violence,
The Regulation has summarized and improved based on it, with many items encouraging social mobilization and accumulation of social resources in order to safeguard women’s rights. It also requires people's government above the county level to provide stable and institutional support through purchasing services.
The salt-tolerant rice field at Hinggan League Yuan Longping Academician Workstation in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region produces over 1000 grams of rice
According to the Sub-provincial Administrative Office at Hinggan League in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on 27th, reporters learned that there was great news from "Hinggan League Yuan Longping academician workstation salt-tolerant rice field yield acceptance council" held in the league one day ago: the average yield of the salt-tolerant rice was over 1000 grams per mu.
The expert group for measuring production, which is comprised of six experts from Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yangzhou University and Rural Administration of Agriculture in Hunan Province, took samples of the rice from “Hinggan salt series” on the spot.
Through the experts’ test, the average yield of the salt-tolerant rice was 508.8 kilograms per mu in the soil with PH value ranging from 8.8 to 9.6 and salinity ranging from 5‰ to 6‰.
The executive head of Hinggan League Yuan Longping Academician Workstation Wang Shigang said: “Our next step is to further innovate and reform based on the test this year, cultivating and optimizing the variety of salt-tolerant rice again to improve its quality and production. “
Lai Yongcai, the leader of the expert group for measuring production and the deputy dean and researcher from Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said: “On the premise that production factors do not change, I think that the ability to tackle hard-nut problems in science and technology needs further improved so that the salt-tolerant rice will perform miracles again in the saline-alkali soil.
The Hinggan League is among the contiguous poor areas at the southern foothill of Great Khingan.
The Yuan Longping Academician Workstation was established on October 2018.
Yuan Longping academician led expert groups to enhance the import and generalization of advanced technology and the variety of newly-cultivated “hybrid salt-tolerant rice”, construct 960 mu of salt-tolerant rice base at Horqin Right Middle Banner, help local impoverished people increase both production and income as well as overcome their poverty and achieve prosperity by following the technical route of conducting experimental demonstration and generalization at the same time.
The field measure of salt-tolerant rice this time not only brings hope for Hinggan League to turn its low-productive saline-alkali field into high-productive field but also offers scientific evidence for the cultivation of rice in saline-alkali soil under the same condition.
According to the au123.com, after a marathon debate and weeks of protests, Australia's New South Wales has passed the bill to legalize abortions on September 26 local time.
It is reported that the bill has sparked political debate in the past eight weeks. Since the independent Member of Parliament Greenwich announced the introduction of the bill there have been deep divisions over this issue within the Australian Liberal Party.
The report said that after nearly 40 hours of discussions, the Senate of Australia's New South Wales voted 26 to 14 to pass the Abortion Legalization Bill in the evening of the 25th, making it the third longest reviewed bill in the New South Wales Senate.
On the morning of the 26th, after a final vote in the House of Representatives, abortions in New South Wales were legalized.
The bill allows women to terminate their pregnancy at the 22nd week of gestation, and a woman is also allowed to have an abortion later in the pregnancy if two doctors agree.
On the evening of the 25th, the Senate passed an amendment that doctors can seek advice from the multidisciplinary panel of the Hospital Advisory Committee before they perform abortions for women after 22 weeks of pregnancy.
In addition, the amendment passed by the Senate also included that doctors must provide proper care for babies who survived the termination of pregnancy.
Earlier, the premier of New South Wales, Gladys Berejiklian, had faced public criticisms over the bill from the conservatives. Gladys Berejiklian had attempted several times to intervene in order to gain more time for debate on the bill, but she did not attend the final vote."
Gladys Berejiklian defended her absentee vote: "I need to spend time managing the entire New South Wales."
It is reported that the Australian Liberal MP Davis was the strongest opponent to the abortion bill. He had once threatened to withdraw from the New South Wales government because of the bill, saying that the bill triggered a "government crisis."
But then, Davis made a concession.
Davis said: "The amendment to the abortion legalization bill that was submitted to the House of Representatives on the morning of the 26th actually provides more protections for women and doctors."
At the same time, Australian's New South Wales National Party leader Barillaro said he was proud to be a member of the government that legalized abortion.
"What we have achieved last night is of historical significance for New South Wales. By legalizing abortion, it is no longer a criminal act and women who have abortions will not be treated as criminals."

A total of 860.1 billion yuan of the state capital from 67 centrally-administered state-owned enterprises and central financial institutions has been transferred to social security funds, according to China's Minister of Finance Liu Kun.
On the 27th, China's Minister of Finance Liu Kun said that by now, a total of 860.1 billion Chinese yuan (about 121.6 billion U.S. dollars) of the state capital from 67 centrally-administered state-owned enterprises and central financial institutions has been transferred to social security funds.
Liu Kun made the above announcement at a meeting on implementing the plan for transferring part of state-owned capital to fortify social security funds jointly held by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MOHRSS) and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC).
"Transferring part of state-owned capital to fortify social security funds is an important step to reforming and improving China's old-age insurance plan. It also proves that China has achieved the intergenerational equity of the basic old-age insurance plan and is sharing the fruit of the development of state-owned enterprises with all people. The measure is based on present realities whilst taking future development into consideration."
In 2017, the State Council issues the Implementation Plan for Transferring Part of State-Owned Capital to Fortify Social Security Funds, deciding to pilot the measure in selected central and local state-owned enterprises.
China has now made positive progress in the first phase of replenishing social security funds with the state capital, said Liu Kun.
At the central level, a total of 860.1 billion yuan of the state capital from 67 centrally-administered state-owned enterprises and central financial institutions has been transferred to social security funds within three rounds.
Among all 67 enterprises and institutions, central financial institutions with MOF performing duties as the capital contributor have completed the transfer.
The replenishment work has been finished in a significant number of centrally-administered state-owned enterprises.
At the local level, earlier work has also started.
The pilot work of replenishment in Zhejiang province and Yunnan province has been basically completed, with 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan, respectively, having been transferred by the end of 2018, according to Liu.
On top of the pilot provinces, other provinces are also pushing forward their first-phase preparations, laying a solid foundation for the implementation of the transfer.
According to the notice issued jointly by MOF, MOHRSS, SASAC and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the work of replenishing social security funds with state capital at the central and local level begins in 2019 and shall be basically finished by the end of 2020.
The meeting made specific arrangements to implement the replenishment work.
The meeting stressed that the transfer work should be carried out in a pragmatic and efficient manner.
"Based on the arrangement, the transfer work shall be basically finished by the end of 2020."
"Massive tasks need to be done in a limited time."
Liu Kun said that relevant departments of all levels in all regions should push forward the work and complete the task as required. All departments should have a deep understanding about the transfer measure to do a solid job and improve communication and coordination to solve problems and difficulties as soon as possible.
Transferring part of state-owned capital to fortify social security funds: from "filling the pocket of social security funds" to providing strong support for the pension
However, the author believes that this is not a simple "physical displacement" of equity, but rather a "mathematical addition".
On September 20th, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Taxation Administration and China Securities Regulatory Commission jointly issued the Notice on Carrying out the Implementation Plan for Transferring Part of State-Owned Capital to Fortify Social Security Funds to clarify the timetable for transferring part of state-owned capital to fortify social security funds. The plan is to carry out the transfer by the central and local governments in 2019.
After issuing the document, the Ministry of Finance and other departments have quickly implemented the plan.
On September 25th, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10% of its shareholding in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China(ICBC) and Agricultural Bank of China(ABC) to the National Council for Social Security Fund(SSF). The total value of the transferred equity exceeded 115 billion Chinese yuan.
According to the regulation, as financial investors, the undertaking entities such as SSF enjoy the right to earn, dispose and know in terms of the state-owned equity they receive.
ICBC and ABC stated in the announcement that the change in equity this time would not cause any changes in the banks' controlling shareholders and actual controllers.
Regarding this, the author believes that the transfer of the equity of a state-owned enterprise is not a simple change in equity ownership, but an "addition" that can lead to several effects.
The first "result of addition" after the transfer of some state-owned assets to social security funds is that a state-owned enterprise actually belongs to all people and the fruit of development is shared by all.
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in the Chinese economy. Their overall profitability is relatively high and steady.
Among all state-owned enterprises, leading enterprises have been growing better, bigger and stronger in recent years.
On July 10th, the Executive Meeting of the State Council decided to fully promote the transfer of some of the state-owned capital to fortify the social security funds this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately stated afterwards that they would work with relevant departments to fully promote the transfer of part of state-owned capital to fortify the social security funds in accordance with the deployment of the Executive Meeting of the State Council, fully achieve the intergenerational equity of the basic endowment insurance system and share the fruit of the development of state-owned enterprises with all people.
The second "result of addition" is that the transfer can enhance the sustainability of China’s social security fund and further consolidate the foundation of the old-age social security system.
Because of the aging process, China's social security fund is under pressure. Most of the state-owned capital to be transferred this time can continuously bring profits and dividends. This will not only supplement the social security fund effectively, but also provide a constant source for the social security fund.
Calculations showed that every 3.8-percentage-point transfer of state-owned capital could help reduce the rate of basic pension insurance contribution of enterprises by one percentage point.
The third "addition result" of transfer is adding a stabilizer to the capital market.
The undertaking entity of the transfer earns profits mostly from the dividend, supplemented by the operation.
As a financial investor in state-owned capital, the SSF does earn most of the profit from equity dividends.
However, as a value investor in the capital market, the SSF has strong capabilities of capital operation.
For listed assets of state-owned capital, the holding of shares of the SSF will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed companies and help improve the companies' level of business operations, bringing positive impacts to listed companies and capital markets.
Moreover, the SSF as a weathercock for investment is going to be more influential in the market and help stabilize the market by increasing the proportion of shareholding.
In addition, it will also help to guide investors on how to be a rational investor and how to make a value investment.
Karl Hartmann was admitted to the Leipzig Conservatory at the age of 18 and later studied under Webern.
When the Nazi came to power, Harmann first expressed his resistance by not publishing his work in Germany and later even stopped composing all together.
He composed the symphony "Miserae" in 1933 and dedicated it to "my friends who sleep for all eternity."
In 1935, this symphony was premiered in Prague, which was followed by harassment of Nazi officials.
After that, Hartmann decided not to have any of his work performed under Nazi rule.
Hartmann's Concerto funerbre is a composition for violin and string orchestra. At that time, its manuscript was smuggled out of Germany and first performed in Switzerland.

US Senate confirms Scalia as Labor Secretary - Xinhuanet
By Ding Sun, Xianlai Deng in Washington, Xinhua News Agency, September 26. The US Senate voted to approve President Trump’s nomination of Eugene Scalia as Labor Secretary.
There were 53 votes for and 44 against the nomination, and no single Democrat voted for Scalia.
Republicans thought that Scalia’s record suggested he is suitably qualified to head the Department of Labor.
From the perspective of Democrats, however, Scalia has long stood on the opposite side of workers and labor unions in his career as a lawyer.
Scalia will succeed Alexander Acosta.
On July this year, the former Labor Secretary Acosta announced his resignation under immense pressure of public opinion against his “lenient treatment” afforded to Jeffrey Epstein, the American billionaire who was charged with sex assault and sex trafficking of underage girls.
Scalia is a 56-year-old partner at a famous law firm in the US, and his father is the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
The Department of Labor, which is responsible for labor-related matters, is a cabinet-level department of the U.S. federal government.
On the same day, the White House also made a statement that Trump had nominated Peter Gaynor‎, the acting administrator of Federal Emergency Management Agency, to officially head this organization.
According to the procedure, Gaynor’s nomination needs to be confirmed by the Senate.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is an agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security. Its responsibility involves coordinating the resources of federal government to respond to the emergencies including natural disasters and terrorist attacks that have occurred in the US, as well as the follow-ups to these emergencies.
Giant formation of the Strategic Missile Troop appears in every military review after its debut in China's 35th National Day parade
“This year's National Day parade is the debut of People's Liberation Army (PLA) Rocket Force as a strategic force on Beijing's Chang'an Avenue.”
Wang Bo from Commanding Group of the PLA Rocket Force Formation said.
The Missile Troop in the parade fully carried on the spirit of being able to fight, dedicate and endure hardships. They were trained carefully, strictly and scientifically. They presented a positive image of strategic military forces and emphasized their exactitude.
Both generals and soldiers strictly followed the standard and the requirement in this military parade training. They were trained to act immediately and resolutely and strictly follow the order.
They also focused on carrying on the craftsmanship spirit by grasping every detail to practice the technique and improving perseverance and the style of work. They were trained to have great poses, fast actions and sonorous voices. The Missile Troop formation was full of power and grandeur because of their exactitude and technological innovation.
As a high-tech strategic military force, the PLA Rocket Force has a tradition and advantage of emphasizing scientific and technological development and innovation.
During the military parade training, based on previous experiences, they improved the training quality and efficiency, achieved the harmony between the people and the vehicles, ensured the timing of formation moving and followed the standards in actual combat by breaking the set way of thinking and the traditional method and using advanced methods such as the GPS, laser ranging, high-definition imaging and real-time speed measurement.
The PLA Rocket Force has the same standard and higher requirement in the parade ground and the launch site. Each process and every detail were supervised during the training in order to make the parade ground both a training ground and an examination ground for the Rocket Force to increase combat effectiveness.
Iran's implementation of the Iranian nuclear agreement was further suspended with confirmation that its development of more advanced centrifuges was under way.
ECNS Sept 27 The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Monday that Iran has once again violated the nuclear agreement by using the advanced centrifuges to produce enriched uranium, CNA reported.
It is reported that Iran is gradually violating the limitations of the Iran nuclear agreement in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the deal in May 2018 and the restoration and tightening of sanctions against Iran.
The move follows Iran's suspension in July of two other commitments to keep its stockpile of enriched uranium under 300kg and enrich uranium not higher than 3.67%.
Under the nuclear deal, Iran will only be allowed to set up about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges at Natanz to accumulate enriched uranium, and it will only be allowed to use a few more advanced models for research but not to facilitate the uranium enrichment.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, they will be able to enrich uranium several times faster, potentially being used for nuclear bombs.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency's report, "On September 25th, the IAEA confirmed that Iran had developed advanced centrifuges of model 2 and model 3... Enriched uranium is being accumulated or is ready to be accumulated," reports said.
The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented the report to member states on June 26, and a diplomatic official responded: "They are busy at the [Natanz enriched uranium] facility."

Italian Education Minister Lorenzo Fioramonti calls for sugar taxes to protect public health.
Italian Minister of Education Lorenzo Fioramonti, of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, proposed a motion to the parliament to call for new taxes on high-sugar drinks, sugary foods and airlines tickets.
It is reported that the Italian government will levy taxes on food products, such as sugary drinks and foods, that pose a threat to public health, as well as an environmental tax on airline tickets at one euro for a domestic flight and 1.5 euros for an international flight, according to the proposal of Italian Education Minister Fioramonti.
Fioramonti said that the measures to impose the taxes are expected to bring three billion euros of revenue for the Italian government although they seem to be of little effect.
The tax revenue will be invested in education, health and environmental protection.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte believed that this should be a practical plan. An Italian senator, member of the European Parliament and Leader of the League Party Matteo Salvini commented ironically on twitter that everybody should hide their desserts, cookies, bread and candies because the new government is going to impose sugar taxes.
According to the report, the sugar tax is a special tax especially on sugary drinks and high-calorie foods.
Levying taxes on sugar will be beneficial to public health.

The first Robtaxi fleet, including 45 Red Flag EV vehicles jointly developed by Apollo and FAW Red Flag, has been put into operation on parts of the roads open for the test ride in Changsha.
From now on, Changsha citizens can go Apollo's official website to apply for their privileges of being seminal users to get the opportunity of taking a test ride.
One participant passenger said that he sat at the back of the vehicle and started the self-driving ride just with one click on the screen in front of the passenger seat.
In the testing vehicle, one safety supervisor is required to sit at the driver's seat to maximize the safety of passengers in order to meet the requirements of current policies and regulations on the passengers' safety guarantee.
During the ride the vehicle is able to intelligently change lanes according to traffic conditions and automatically avoid any close overtaking of nearby cars in a short distance by judging their movements.
Throughout the whole test ride, the screen at the passenger side brings in real-time information about pedestrians, cars, and even includes some traditional blind spots on the road.
Even if the vehicle is blocked, any traffic signal on the way ahead and the signal switches can be informed to you in advance, all the vehicle and traffic data can be found at a glance.
We have ever heard of the self-driving on TV earlier, and it was believed to be too far away from us , howerver, it's so amazing to find it has come into life today.
We look forward to seeing its introduction into the lives of common people in the near future.
In June 2019, Apollo had got 45 licenses for the manned-test ride from Changsha municipal government.
At present, Changsha's open roads for the self-driving test, running through Changsha AI techno mart, meixi lake, yang lake, king hill and high-tech zone, has reached a total length of 135 kilometers and 70 square kilometers of coverage area, which is China's most advanced self-driving demonstration zone with the longest distance, the largest coverage, the most complex traffic enviroment and the most sophisticated basic infrastructue of road-vehicle coordination.
It was expected that Changsha will open nearly 50 kilometers of test-ride roads for the Apollo Robotaxi fleet by the end of 2019, and open the full length of 135 kilometers by the first half of 2020.
Lang Ping is still dissatisfied when women’s volleyball team won the game, saying that it is harder to play with stronger team with so many mistakes.
In the afternoon of 27th Beijing Time, Chinese woman’s volleyball team participated in the 9th game of the 2019 women’s volleyball world cup. The opponent was the strong Dutch women’s volleyball team. Finally, Chinese women’s volleyball team defeated the Dutch team with a score of 3:1. It is the ninth straight in the women’s volleyball world cup.
However, the head coach of the women’s volleyball team, Lang Ping, expressed her dissatisfaction with the team’s performance in the third round of the game afterward.
“In the third game, the opponent strengthened the offensive attack. Some (the first pass of ball) are not done well resulting in the incapability to smash the ball. Out team made many mistakes.”
“With that many mistakes, it is hard to win a game with stronger teams.”
Lang Ping said when interviewed after the game.
“We told the team members to focus. If we did not do well in the first pass due to the opponent’s strong attack, we need to do well in the adjustment. In addition, we need to compete with the opponent in the defense.”
Lang Ping also commented on the performance of Zhang Changning, saying that she was too eager to make a smash when meeting with difficulties in attacks. Thus, her move will be distorted.
She hoped that she can be patient. “Other team members will support her in attacks.”
China's development brings an opportunity rather than a threat or a challenge to the world
(The 70 years of a new China) White paper: China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
The white paper pointed out that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The white paper said that as China's overall national strength and international influence have increased rapidly, some people in the world are concerned that China will follow the pattern of "seeking hegemony after getting powerful," and some people have put forward the so-called "China threat theory."
There are cognitive misunderstandings, deep-rooted prejudices, psychological imbalances led by the rise and fall of powers, and deliberate distortions to protect existing interests.
To achieve national prosperity, national revitalization, and people's well being is not only the dream of the Chinese people but also the common dream of the people of all countries.
"China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge."
The white paper pointed out that China is the main stabilizer and source of power for global economic growth, the largest contributor to global economic growth. China's technological innovation will foster new drivers for global economic growth. In the future, the role of stabilizer and power source of China's economy will become even more prominent.
The current growth of the world's economy is underpowered, and a sound Chinese economy is increasingly important to the world.
China's economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development, the new-type industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization are in the fast lanes. With economic structures further adjusted and industrial optimizations continuously upgraded, China's new economic growth points continue to emerge.
"The McKinsey Global Institute's research report believes that by 2040, the integrations between China and the rest of the world economic entities are expected to create an economic value of $22 trillion to $37 trillion US dollars, equivalent to 15%-26% of the total global economy. Strengthening the cooperation between the rest of world economic entities and China will create huge economic value."
The white paper stressed that China's economy and the global economy have undergone structural changes and deep integrations
China, which has a more stable economic operation, higher growth quality and promising growth prospects, is a long-term favorable driver of the development of the world economy.
Taking China's economic development as a "threat" and "challenge", trying to push China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain and value chain, and "decoupling" China from the world economy is neither feasible nor favorable.
The white paper pointed out that a full-scale opening to the outside world will create more opportunities for other countries to share the "China Dividends."
China is unswervingly pursuing a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up to the outside world and will open up even more vigorously and at a higher level. China has the largest potential consumer market in the world, and it is the most attractive investment destination, and a larger scale of "going overseas" will benefit more countries.
"The opening should be bilateral and mutually beneficial, not one-way and one-sided.
Only the two-way and mutual benefit can go a long way."
The white paper said that China is committed to continuing to expand imports, relax restrictions on market access, improve the business environment, and strengthen intellectual property protections. Other countries should also open wider and take corresponding measures to improve their own business.
Only when all parties act in the same direction can an open, inclusive, universally beneficial, balanced and win-win development environment be created, and the "cake" of development will be made bigger and bigger to form a mutually beneficial community of interests.
The white paper pointed out that China provides more public products for the international community.
Which includes promoting high-quality joint construction of the "Belt and Road”, building a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively provide foreign assistance.
"China's development was benefited from the international communities and it will never forget to give back to the international families and provide more and better public products for the international communities."
When being interviewed by the reporter of Xinhua Net, Andrey Slepnev, General Director of the Russian Export Center(REC) Group, said that Russia would like to enhance economic and trade cooperation with China, improve the export structure and promote Russia's diverse export to China.
Slepnev noted that the export of forestry, machine manufacturing and the chemical industry accounted for a high proportion of all Russia's export to China. Additionally, the export of agricultural products, including oil and fat products, meat products, dairy products, grains, fish and aquatic products, was also important.
In recent years, Russia's export of non-primary materials and non-energy products to China has consistently shown positive dynamics.
When talking about optimizing the structure of Russia's export to China, Slepnev said that Russia had already set a goal of expanding the export of high-tech products in order to meet the importing needs of China and other countries and regions around the world.
Russia's next step is to improve financial and non-financial measures to help increase the number of high-tech enterprises.
Slepnev said that Russia would like to export building technology and high-tech building materials to China and promote cooperation with China in industries such as aviation and the pharmaceutical industry.
There is also great potential for cooperation between Russia and China in developing urban environment.
Slepnev emphasized that many Russian products are "of competitive quality and prices" with products produced by western countries.
In terms of the 200-billion-dollar bilateral trade volume goal in 2024, Slephnev said that industries such as agriculture, machine manufacturing, the chemical industry and forestry will play an important role in achieving the goal.
Russia would like to provide diverse products in these industries in order to promote the export of highly processed products.
He emphasized that Russia would like its exporting companies to be part of the global value-added chain. China is one of the main exporting destinations.
Russia's manufacturers in the agricultural, metallurgic, oil and natural gas and chemical industry are all capable of being part of the process.
By far, the two countries need to enforce their cooperation by "establishing more Sino-Russian joint ventures and developing the export to the third country collaboratively."
Slepnev said that the REC was supporting Russia's export to China by adopting measures and providing relevant services through Russia Export Credit and Investment Insurance Office(EXIAR) and the Export-Import Bank of Russia.
Moreover, the REC would continue to deepen cooperation with relevant Chinese authorities to allow Russian products to be exported to China more easily and increase varieties of products exported to China.

In the regular press conference on the 27th, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang responded to a Taiwanese officer's recent attendance at a meeting on religious issues at UN headquarters, saying such an underhand ploy will only become a laughingstock.

Demonstration in Egypt calling for President to step down The authorities will implement a harsh crackdown
The hashtags on Twitter and other social media advocate that Egyptian civilians go on the street, appealing for President al-Sisi to step down.
Yet the authorities express that they will implement a harsh crackdown.
Since al-Sisi seized power in a military coup as the director of military in 2013, expression of dissents has nearly disappeared. Any kind of protest was extremely dangerous for protesters.
As reported by The Guardian in the UK, the Center for Economic and Social Rights in Cairo, which is a nongovernmental organization, pointed out that more than 1900 people have been arrested since the protests against al-Sisi that rarely occurred broke out last weekend.
Al-Sisi and his family are accused of corruption as they squander public funds out of vanity, causing thousands of civilians go on the street for protest.
Yesterday the Ministry of Interior of Egypt firmly expressed that they would strike back any attempts to destabilize the country without mercy.
The center of Cairo has been guarded. The riot squad, cars of security institutions and plainclothes intelligence agents are everywhere on the streets around the Tahrir Square, which was a focal point for the Egyptian Revolution of 2011.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces had detained many scholars and social elites on 25th, including the professor in politics at Cairo University Nerva, who is also a famous columnist.
He twittered on 24th: “I won’t doubt that al-Sisi’s empery will result in disasters.”
“It is beneficial to Egypt if he is immediately dismissed.”
Before Nerva was arrested, Hosny, the prolocutor for the former Egyptian Military Chief of Staff Annam, had been detained.
Annam was arrested last year when he and al-Sisi tried to run for President.
Dawoud, the leader of the Constitution Party, was also detained.
The analysists and politicians think that the crackdown on people with dissent reflects the instability and weakness of the government, especially when the poor and middle class are in a deteriorating economic plight.
The leader of the opposition party Ayman Nour, who used to run for president, said: “The arrests reveal that this regime disregards Egyptian human rights and how scared it is.”
“AS the economics has been spoiled and the general political oppression it exerts, al-Sisi passed clear information to high-ranking military officers and politicians who might be able to succeed him.”
Nour noted that against the background of continuous deterioration of social economics, the government’s crackdown would make civilians angrier.
Since the fear has been overcame, he expects more people will go on the demonstration.
The small-scale demonstrations in different cities last week were stemmed from a call by Ali, a former military construction contractor living in exile in Spain as a merchant and actor. In a series of videos that he posted at the beginning of this month, he self-proclaimed that he benefited from government’s corruption.
Ali said his company Amlac would always gain lucrative contracts without statutory tender, stressing corruption the military and al-Sisi’s family including the First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He bitterly regretted having taken part of it.
Ali claimed that he helped al-Sisi build palaces luxury hotels, in marked contrast to Egyptian people’s poor lives at present. In addition, al-Sisi did not pay for that.
Many hashtags on twitter, such as “you are not alone to stand out”, “al-Sisi is finished”, “al-Sisi out”, and “next Friday”, have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and re-tweets, appealing the public to go on the street and request al-Sisi to step down.
The Egyptian actor in Hollywood Amor Wake has nearly 7 million followers under his twitter.
He twittered using Arabic yesterday: “al-Sisi is bound to be finished…He is finished, and his supporters would make a terrible blunder now.”
Hong Kong government provides free special training to help employees weather a hard time
On the 27th, the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) announced a plan to provide free special training for employees who have been in difficulties because of the current economic condition. Students who complete the course and gain a qualification can receive at most 4000 Hong Kong dollars of allowance every month.
There have been only a few customers in many boutiques in Harbour City in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon.
Affected by the recent social disputes in Hong Kong, the number of visitors to Hong Kong has fallen dramatically. In addition to the tourism industry, many other industries including the hotel, catering and retail business have all been affected.
The Secretary for Labour and Welfare of the Hong Kong SAR government Law Chi-kwong and the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau met the press to introduce measures to entrust the Employees Retraining Board (ERB) to implement a special training plan and support the development of the tourism industry.
Law Chi-kwong described that the Hong Kong economy is facing imminent challenges and the government should start to address them as soon as possible.
As a result, the Hong Kong SAR government launched the free training plan called "Special: Love Plus".
People who lost their jobs or were asked by the employers to stay at home unpaid after June 1st can join the plan as long as they meet the requirements.
Law Chi-kwong introduced that the course covers a wide range of knowledge. The most important part is the training of professional skills, which include skills of 19 industries, such as the tourism, retail and food industry. There are also new courses on creative technologies and general skills.
Chairman of the ERB Yu Pang-chun said that all the courses are free of charge and the plan is estimated to support 10 thousand people who are in need of help.
In order to gain the allowance, what a participant should do is to complete all full-time courses or some part-time courses and have an 80 percent of the attendance record. The upper limit of the amount of allowance is 4000 HK dollars.
The course usually lasts for two to three months and is provided by 50 training institutions. Citizens can sign up and begin their courses from October 3rd to March 31st 2020. Each person can sign up for less than four courses.
Additionally, the Hong Kong SAR government announced several measures to help the tourism industry to weather a crunch.
The measures include allocating more money to support the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong, giving financial aid to 6000 guides to sign up for the course and exempting travel agencies from annual fees.
Is it true that doing exercise will exhaust people physically and psychologically?
According to sputniknews.com, a study focusing on athletes has found that the brain will also show signs of fatigue after doing high-intensity exercises.
The study, led by Mathias Pesiglion, an expert at the Hospital Pithier-Salpetriere in France, showed that there was no definite link between mental work and physical labor: both will require cognitive control over the activities.
"You need to control the autonomous processes that force you to stop when you have pain in your muscles and joints," Pesagrion explained.
The study was initiated by France's National Institute of Sport, Expertise and Performance (INSEP).
Experts at the school are responsible for guiding athletes in their preparations for the Olympic Games.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from overtraining syndrome, which is an uncontrollable feeling of fatigue after doing a heavy load of exercises that makes their bodies unable to recover and makes their performance decline.
INSEP raised a question: could nerve fatigue be part of the reasons that will cause such a disease, the kind of nerve fatigue that results from excessive mental labor?
The research was published in the journal of Contemporary Biology.

According to Cui Aimin, China had reached visa abolition agreement with 14 countries by the end of August this year, involving people with ordinary passports.
Furthermore, more and more countries unilaterally provide visa-free access landing visa for the convenience of Chinese citizens.
42 countries and regions including Thailand and Egypt unilaterally provide landing visa for Chinese citizens with ordinary passports, while 15 countries and regions including Indonesia provide Chinese citizens with ordinary passports with visa-free access.
In addition to visa-free service and landing visa, it is more and more convenient for Chinese citizens to apply for visas with increasingly simpler procedures.
China and 41 countries had reached agreement on the simplification of visa procedure with 41 countries by the end of August.
It reached agreement with the US, Canada, Israel and Argentina to mutually issue 10-year valid multi-entry visa for tourists and businessmen, and another agreement with UK to mutually issue the 2-year multi-entry visa for tourists, businessmen and visiting relatives.
UK and Belgium jointly provided the one-stop service of visa, while France, Italy and Singapore cur down the visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
For businessmen who go abroad frequently, the APEC business travel card for multi-entry and convenient custom clearance is a good choice.
According to Cui Aimin, holding this card means having the 5-year multi-entry visa to 16 economic entities around Asia-Pacific, which is of great importance to businessmen, especially the staff at private enterprises.
At present, the number of Chinese people holding the valid card ranks as the first place in the APEC economic entities.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate the reciprocal agreement on bilateral visa and promote more countries to provide convenient visa procedures for Chinese citizens, putting more diplomatic working achievements into initiatives that are beneficial and convenient for civilians and constantly improving the “gold content” of China passport.

The United States will deploy additional air defense systems and troops in Saudi Arabia
The U.S. Department of Defense announced on the 26th that following an earlier attack on the oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the United States will deploy an additional "Patriot" air defense system, four "Sentinel" radar systems and about 200 US troops in the country.
The Pentagon said in a statement that day, the deployment will boost the air defense and anti-missile capabilities of key military targets and civilian infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, as well as enhance the US military presence in the region.
The statement also said that US Secretary of Defense Esper approved at the same time to include two suits of "Patriot" air defense systems and one set of "THAAD" anti-missile system in the sequence ready for deployment.
Some US defense media have questioned the effectiveness of the deployment, saying that the primary interception target of the Patriot and THAAD systems is not the low-altitude targets such as drones and cruise missiles that the US claims have hit Saudi Arabia.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in the general debates at the United Nations General Assembly on the 25th that Iran can help maintain "Persian Gulf security" and ensure the smooth and safe passage of oil tank vessels cruising through the Strait of Hormuz, provided that all countries can enjoy equal rights.
He also stressed that regional security can only be achieved if U.S. troops withdraw from the region.
On the 14th of this month, several drones attacked two oil facilities belonging to the Saudi National Petroleum Corporation and gave rise to a fire.
The United States accused Iran of launching the attack and imposed new sanctions on Iran.
Thalys Chairman increased own holdings after encouraged employees to hold shares last year which led to a floating profit of 43%
In the evening of September 25, Chinese medical technology company Thalys (603716.SH) announced that Wei Wen, actual controller and Chairman of the company, completed the plan to increase shareholding by 1.0542 million shares, accounting for 0.5139% of the company's total capital share, through call auction in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The total amount of the increase in shareholding was 20.0926 million Chinese yuan, including transaction fees such as stamp tax, commission and interest.
It was reported that before the implementation of the plan to increase the shareholding, Wei Wen directly held 8.58 million shares of Thalys, accounting for 4.18% of the company's total capital share. Tianjin Ruimei Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd. (hereafter Tianjin Ruimei), the company's shareholder, holds 82.1835 million shares of the company, accounting for 40.06% of the company's total capital share. Wei Wen holds 66.06% of Tianjin Ruimei's shares, making him the actual controller of the company.
It is worth noting that this is not the first time for Thalys to offer a favorable measure.
Since September last year, Thalys has successively launched measures such as shareholding increase among senior executives, chairman-guaranteed shareholding increase initiative, share repurchase and equity incentives in just a year.
On September 18 last year, Thalys announced that seven senior executives, including Wenhao Liu, had increased their shareholdings by 394,300 shares, accounting for 0.1922% of the company’s total capital share. The total amount of the increase in shareholding was 7.0229 million yuan. The shareholding increase had been completed.
Shortly after that, Wei Wen proposed a plan for employees to increase the holding of the company's shares and promised to compensate for any loss.
The planned period of increasing shareholding was from October 19 to October 31, 2018. The upper limit of the shareholding increase should not exceed 150 million. After the increase, the company's shares must be held continuously for more than 12 months without any reduction. Additionally, compensation will not be paid to employees who have resigned.
The reporter found that the lowest share price of Thalys was 14.02 yuan and the highest was 16.44 yuan during the employee shareholding increase plan period. Based on the closing price of Thalys on September 25, the highest floating profit of shareholding increase reached 42.08% and the lowest was 21.87%.
On January 21 this year, Thalys once again passed the share repurchase plan. The announcement stated that the total amount of capital for share repurchase was not less than 160 million yuan and not more than 280 million yuan.
On August 8 this year, the company issued an announcement of "Thalys 2019 Restricted Plan for Share Incentives (Draft)" and set high conditions for unlocking performance.
The announcement showed that equity incentives were based on the operating revenue in 2018. The growth rates for the four fiscal years from 2019 to 2022 must not be less than 30%, 70%, 120% and 185% respectively.
Thalys' performance in the first half of this year showed that the company had maintained high growth and exceeded the unlock conditions for performance growth by 30%.
In the first half of the year, the company achieved an operating revenue of 842 million yuan, which was up 46.5% year-on-year. The net profit for shareholders of listed company was 56.223 million yuan, which was a 16.46% increase over last year.
Since the report in the middle of 2018, the growth of the operating revenue of Thalys has been more than 38% over the previous year for five reporting periods, with the highest growth of 59%.
In 2018, the company formulated a dual-core driven collaborative development strategy which takes medical inspection intensive operation services (IVD business) as the basis, medical consumables intensive operation services (SPD business) and regional inspection centers as the breakthrough. That is to promote the SPD business on the basis of improving the IVD business.
A source from Thalys told the reporter that in order to follow the trend of medical reform and achieve rapid expansion, Thalys had been promoting its three major businesses steadily.
In terms of the SPD business, in January this year, Thalys announced the signing of a three-year agreement of Cooperation in the Construction of Intensive Operation Platforms for Medical Consumables and Daily Operation Management Services with Lingwu People's Hospital and Lingwu Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital.
"In fact, Thalys is vigorously expanding its SPD business to provide medical institutions with refined operational services such as centralized procurement, warehousing management, distribution, and settlement of medical consumables in hospitals to obtain long-term revenue."
The source said.
On September 17, according to the announcement of the Zhejiang Government Information Platform for Purchasing Services, Thalys won the bid for an "in-hospital logistics extension service project for medical consumables (including reagents)" at Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine.
An analyst in the pharmaceuticals industry pointed out that the bid they won was of high value. Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital was the first public hospital in the mainland of China that received Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation. The successful implementation of this project in the future would be an important opportunity for the hospital's development.
According to the analyst, through the expansion in regions, nationwide strategic cooperation and channel mergers and acquisitions, Thalys has basically completed the business coverage of the provinces across the country.
By winning the bid of Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, the company will continue to carry out the model in different hospitals to enhance its competitiveness in the East China market.
In addition, Thalys is also developing its business in new areas such as industrial hemp and blockchain technology.

1 AC and 1 DC two major UHV projects have been put into operation
On the 26th, the ±1100 KV UHV DC transmission project from Zhundong to southern Anhui and the Sutong 1000 KV AC UHV GIL integrated pipeline corridor project were both put into operation.
The power transmission technologies at work in both projects are at the very top of the world in their respective fields, which will sharply boost the optimization of China's large-scale energy allocation after the operation kicks off.
Guo Zhi, chief economist of the National Energy Administration, said that the project from Zhundong to southern Anhui is the world's largest power transmission project with the longest transmission distance.
Its operation is of great significance for promoting the development of Xinjiang's energy base and ensuring the power supply in eastern China.
GIL refers to gas insulated metal enclosed transmission line.
The Sutong pipeline corridor project has set a world record with the highest voltage level and the strongest transmission capacity among all GIL projects, realizing AC double-loop network's closed-loop operation of the highest voltage level in the backbone grid of eastern China.
According to the State Grid Corporation of China, the transmission distance from Zhundong to southern Anhui is up to 3,324 kilometers.
If conventional technologies were applied, more than 15 percent of the electricity will be lost in its transmission. Through the project's research and development, the economic transmission distance has been greatly increased to more than 3,000 kilometers.
After the project from Zhundong to South Anhui is put into operation, it can deliver 100 million kWhs of electricity every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which will help solve the problem of Xinjiang's existing new energy consumption.
According to the estimates of its full-load capacity, the annual transmission of this line alone will reach 60 to 85 billion kWhs, which can satisfy more than half of Shanghai's electricity consumption throughout the year.
The Sutong GIL integrated pipeline corridor project is the controlling part of UHV AC ring network crossing the Changjiang River.
If conventional overhead lines were applied to cross the river, two giant steel towers more than 450 meters tall could have to be built up in the Changjiang River, and a man-made island covering an area of more than four football fields would have to be built for each tower.
With nerve and creativity, the State Grid has developed its compact UHV AC GIL transmission technology to avoid the impact on the golden waterways by crossing the river via underwater tunnels.
The two projects have made a new leap in China's manufacturing capabilities of electrical equipment.
At present, the State Grid has completed 10 AC and 11 DC UHV projects in total, and there are still 4 AC and 3 DC projects under construction.
SAFE: China's external debt structure has continued to be optimized and its stability strengthened.
"Overall, China's external debt structure has continued to be optimized and its stability strengthened."
Wang Chunying, spokesperson and Chief Economist of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange(SAFE), said on the 27th that major indicators of the country's external debt are within the internationally recognized safety line and the risk of the external debt is generally controllable.
Wang Chunying made the above statement when answering questions from reporters after SAFE published China's external debt data at the end of June 2019 on the same day.
By the end of June this year, China's full-scale outstanding external debt (in both domestic and foreign currencies)stood at 1.998 trillion U.S. dollars, up 1.3 percent or 26.3 billion dollars from the end of March, mainly due to the increase in the balance of debt securities, SAFE data showed.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70 percent of the increase in China's full-scale external debt was driven by the purchase of domestic yuan-denominated bonds by non-residents. These non-residents were mainly medium- and long-term investors in banks such as the People's Bank of China.
At the end of June 2019, the ratio of the medium- and long-term external debt rose by 3 percentage points and the ratio of external debt in domestic currency rose by 1 percentage point from the end of March 2019.
International investors have shown further recognition of China's bond market and have increased their holding of domestic yuan-denominated bonds after the country's yuan-denominated bonds were added to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index in April this year, according to Wang Chunying.
"China maintains an overall balance of international payments and the risk of the external debt is generally controllable."
Reporters learned from Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences on the 27th that the fall armyworm have been effectively brought under control without causing large-scale outbreaks and disasters, marking the achievement of prevention work at this stage.
The fall armyworm migrated from outside China was first discovered this January in Jiangcheng County, Pu'er City, Yunnan Province. Later, another 129 counties of Yunnan confirmed its presence, and the pest also spread from Yunnan towards inland, posing a direct threat to China's agricultural production.
The fall armyworm is an important polyphagous agricultural pest with long-distance migration capability that is originated from tropical and subtropical regions in North and South America. It is a dangerous migratory pest with "transboundary, migratory, outbreaking, and destructive" capabilities for which the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has launched a global warning system.
This pest attacks more than 80 crops including corn, sugar cane, and sorghum, with its big consumption that could lead to the loss of up to 70% of the yield.
It is difficult to prevent and control, as there is currently no registered pesticide against it in China.
Since the fall armyworm invaded Yunnan, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences appointed the researcher Chen Aidong, who led a team of green prevention and control of transboundary pest from Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, went to the front line to conduct field work, collect samples, and give technical instructions and experimental demonstrations.
Chen Aidong’s team has established a preliminary understanding of situation, including the pest’s population characteristics, predators, characteristics of foreign pest origins, migration trajectories, pesticide toxicity, effects of field control, etc.
They actively carried out research on green pest prevention technology and its applications, including population monitoring, adult trapping, scientific use of pesticides, and agronomic methods, etc. Through these methods, they managed to control more than 90% of the pest in the demonstration area while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, which protects the predators and the ecological environment and provides Yunnan with technical support for effective control of the outbreak of the fall armyworm and for its sustainable management.
As of now, the fall armyworm in Yunnan has been effectively brought under control without causing large-scale outbreaks and disasters, marking the achievement of prevention work at the current stage.
As for the next step, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on the ecological mechanism that triggered the outbreak of the pest's invasion, and aim to make a breakthrough in biological control and establish a system of green prevention and control.
Meanwhile, they will actively seek more international collaborations and aim to establish joint key laboratories, monitoring sites, and demonstration areas in order to enhance Yunnan's capability of comprehensive monitoring and early warning of the fall armyworm.

Through its interactions with the world, China has brought positive energy to world peace and development. China's path is in line with its national conditions and meets the requirements of the times, the White Paper said.
China has gone into practical actions to safeguard world peace.
Over the past 70 years, China has never instigated any war or conflict on its own initiative, nor has it encroached on an inch of land from any other country.
The White Paper points out that the fundamental reason for China's great success in its development over the past 70 years is that it has found the right path of developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and will unswervingly go down this road.
This is a path based on China's national condition by putting the interests of the people at the top place, keeping reform and innovation, and pursuing common development through opening up and comprehensively governing the country in accordance with the law.
China is a large country with complex national conditions, and its difficulty of governance is rarely seen anywhere else in the world. Without a centralized, unified and strong leadership, China will be separated and disintegrated, posing disasters to the world.
"Over the past 70 years, China has overcome all kinds of risks and challenges and created many world-renowned Chinese miracles one after another." the White Paper said.
Especially since the 18th National Congress of Communist Party of China, China has made historic achievements in its development and undergone historic changes, and a great leap forward has also come to the Chinese people as seen in their changes of historical roles from standing-up, getting rich and powerful. The Chinese nation is getting closer to the great objective of national revitalization than ever.
China's development path will, as time goes by, burgeon forth with more promising development prospects.

Scholars from China's Taiwan province suggest: Taiwanese businessmen should follow the Chinese mainland to develop mainstream industries during the "time of uncertainty"
The 2019 Taiwan Businessmen Innovation Business Model Forum was held in Taipei from the 26th to the 27th.
The forum invited many Taiwanese business representatives and scholars to share their experiences on enterprise transformation, innovation, succession and market expanding.
The forum was hosted by the Management Institute in Taipei and co-organized by organizations and institutions such as Capital Securities and the Association of Outstanding Taiwan Business in Chinese Mainland.
The two-day meeting was divided into several seminars including the transformation and upgrade of the model and business strategies. Over a hundred people attended the meeting.
Micky M. C. Chen, president of the Management Institute in Taipei said that as trade frictions between the US and (the mainland of) China continue, Taiwanese businessmen are now facing a "time of uncertainty".
He believes that Taiwanese businessmen should keep pace with the time and keep up with the mainstream industries developed in the Chinese mainland and should pay special attention to innovative products in the technology, culture, tourism and health industry.
"Taiwanese businessmen focused on quality, efficiency and payment in the past."
Micky believes that currently, focusing on the above conditions is no longer enough for Taiwanese businessmen.
He pointed out that Taiwan-funded enterprises should have both speeds and services. They should speed up the supply chain and pay attention to extension services and life products services.
In addition, the value-added service is also a new field that Taiwan businessmen can greatly develop.
In the speech session for representatives, a Taiwanese businessman who is the chairman of Action Asia (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. from China's southern Guangdong province said that the company once experienced operational difficulties due to a sudden reduction in the number of orders. The group then started to improve its operating conditions from structural adjustment and asset activation.
It took the company three years to become profitable after abandoning the traditional electrical appliances business, transforming automotive electronic equipment and entering the smart home appliance industry.
General manager of Apollo Electronics (Zhuhai, China) (headquarter of Apollo Group) Pai Anthony Hung Chang proposed that when encountering difficulties in developing new customers, a company should try to focus more on providing "one-stop" services for the existing customers.
There are usually six reasons when customers change their suppliers: poor services, high prices, low quality, slow delivery speed, less variety and honesty issues. As long as these six points are solved, combining with timely modification of production lines and expansion of product categories, companies will become irreplaceable for customers.
On the 27th, the awarding ceremony of the "2019 Outstanding Taiwanese Businessmen in the Mainland of China" was also hosted by the Management Institute in Taipei.
According to Economic Daily in Taiwan, General Manager of Golden Field which has the operation center in the Shanghai Stephen Lu won the “Outstanding Taiwanese Businessmen and Cross-Strait Contribution Award”.
New regulation is in seek of advice -- social capital needs qualification to acquire rural land management rights
Social capital needs qualification to acquire rural land management rights
Administrative Measures on the Circulation of Rural Land Management Rights, which aims to supervise the acquisitions of land management rights by social capital from industrial and commercial enterprises, starts to solicit public opinions
A notice for public consultation on the Administrative Measures on the Circulation of Rural Land Management Rights (A Revised Version for Public Consultation) (hereinafter referred to as the Consultation Draft), which enhances the supervision and risk control on acquiring land management rights through the circulation of social capital from industrial and commercial enterprises, was published on the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MOA) yesterday.
The Consultation Draft is now open for public opinion today.
According to (MOA), in order to carry out the newly-revised Rural Land Contracting Act, to further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of rural land regulatory system, and implement the system for “separating the ownership rights, contract rights, and management rights for contracted rural land", the Administrative Measures on the Circulation of Management Rights was revised by MOA to form the Consultation Draft.
The Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned that there were a number of important amendments to the Consultation Draft which was published for the first time.
The newly-revised Rural Land Contracting Act clarifies the range of land circulation, implements the concept of "three rights", and elaborates on both "land contracting management rights" and "land management rights" respectively in a separate section to help make a clear distinction between land management rights transfer, exchange and circulation (renting, subcontracting, shareholding or other ways).
As shown in the Consultation Draft, in order to implement the concept of "three rights" and echo effectively with the keynote of the Rural Land Contracting Act, as well as to take into consideration the big differences between the circulation of land management rights and the exchange of land contracting management rights in terms of the parties concerned, procedures and supervisions, the revised version defines the scope of land circulation, focuses on the circulation of land management rights including renting, subcontracting, etc., and also changes the regulation's name from the Administrative Measures on the Circulation of Rural Land Contracting Management Rights to the Administrative Measures on the Circulation of Rural Land Management Rights.
As for the transfer and exchange of land contracting management rights, administrative measures for supervision will be introduced separately.
The Consultation Draft pointed out that in the context of "three rights", what farmers bring in business is land management rights for only a certain period of time.
In theory, even if there is a bankruptcy liquidation, farmers will only be exposed to the risk of losing their management rights for a certain period of time. As a result, there is no legal necessity to stipulate that the contracted land should be returned to the original contractor, which is also in conflict with the Bankruptcy Act.
In order to put in control the risk of farmers' losing of their land, preferred stock, rent-to-share, buyback and other solutions were introduced in practice.
As preferred stock has been largely discussed in the Company Act, it is suggested being taken as an advocacy regulation to prevent the risk of losing the land.
